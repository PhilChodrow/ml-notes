2,"GF and I tried today at lunch. As expected a nice, clean store. \n\nGF went with the salad bar (i think it was $7.50 ) , I went with the New York Yankee - Hot Corned Beef and Pastrami, Swiss, your choice of mustard or mayo ( mayo with CB and Pastrami ... really ? ) on Rye ( $8 ) \n\nI was a little ticked - I initially wanted a deli Club but i was told they ran out of bacon - on a Saturday during lunch hour ?!?! So i asked the cashier, if i get it do you give me a reduced rate since there's no bacon , big surprise, the answer, \"" No ! \"" \n\nI then start to pay the tab ( $21 - included 2 drinks ) with a $100. the cashier says, \"" I don't have change for that . \"" Holy Shit Batman, here's an idea , go get some frickin' change Elroy ! So i paid with a debit card. \n\nThe food - the sammie - nice portion of meat, decent flavor but dang, they must store the meat in a vat of juice because the one side of the sammie was soaked - overall, it was good but drain the meat a little or maybe put it on a grill for a few minutes. I went with the hot mustard but they didn't come close to put enough on to add to the flavor. \n\nThe salad bar is good - nice selection of items, includes some love muffins, a few dessert items and some soft serve ice cream \n\nOf course as we left, ? Goofball cashier yells out, please come back sir i'm sure we'll have bacon for you....smart ass !"
0,Chicken Tacos where good.   Chips and guacamole were nasty.   The only flavor the chips had was a burnt taste.   Service was great.     But the food was lacking and at $4.50 per taco it isn't cheap.   Chips are extra.   So 2 small tacos $9.00.  Chips $7.00.
2,"Things I liked about Graze:\n1. The elderflower margarita \n2. The goat cheese dumplings \n3. The French fries\n\nThings I didn't like about Graze:\n1. The loud, echo-y room\n2. The hype around local when a good part of the menu is not\n3. The long wait time and not taking reservations\n\nA very nice meal but I wanted to love it more than I did. I had the Bahn Mi, which was tasty, but I wanted it to be either more authentic or more inventive. Instead it was stuck in the middle. Full of fresh Thai basil but also with dry ham that did nothing to enhance the flavor. \n\nThe service was friendly and informative and I liked the carafe of water on the table."
3,"Michael Mina makes any restaurant sound interesting.\n\nA little overpriced, but not too much.\n\nA variety fries with a variety of sauces. Loved it.\nLobster fritter. Could have done without. Dough-like. Where's the lobster?\n16 oz bone-in rib eye. Flavorful! My kind of steak.\nKansas strip. Eh.\nSide of cream spiniach. Yum.\n\nAttentive waiters. Good times."
2,"I was let down by yelp.  As someone that travels to new cities non-stop and is always trying new 4.5+ yelp reviews this place is a definite miss.  The salad starter was outstanding and I was expecting the same.  The venison was requested medium rare and was provided overcooked.  We returned it and received another slightly less overcooked venison.  The ahi tuna's texture and flavor were both off (I am extremely familiar with raw fish).  The steak special was a good cut of beef but oversalted.  Maybe it's good for AZ, but in LA, this place wouldn't last a year."
0,"We had to wait 40 min. for our shuttle from the airport. The shuttle itself had an odor that could only come from some kind of excess microbial growth in the air conditioner.\n\nFor the trip back, the driver arrived and got out a cigarette to smoke. She asked if we were waiting for her shuttle. I said yes, and she proceeded to walk away and smoke her cigarette. I then got a call from the Super Shuttle office asking me to go meet the shuttle. When the driver came back, she claimed she hadn't heard me. That would have been more believable if she hadn't gotten out the cigarette as soon as she got to the hotel."
4,Home made! Authentic and delicious
0,"Ugh...just returned from my First Friday experience. and I need to take a bleach shower. Unfortunately, I could not find ANY art, anywhere...just the same old faux cool, dark, post-punk, comic book, psycho-sexualized popular culture garbage that everyone is trying to pass off as art. You know, the constant knockoffs of already tired cultural icons.. glitter paint by number portraits of Johnny Cash and Bruce Lee, Batman pornography, chollo Mickey Mouse  gang-banger tee shirts...oh, and let's not forget Betty Paige...she's always \""original.\"" Everything designed to shock and offend, nothing to elevate perception or experience. Looked in vain to find something original, inspiring or beautiful...NO luck., just lots of ugly, third rate pop culture garbage. Seems lots of people are devotees of the Andy Wharhol School. Plenty of tacky flea market style jewelry stands, lots of unruly drunk/high, aggressive high school kids with loud and filthy mouths...trash everywhere, oh...and getting back to the \""art\"" the majority of \""work\"" revolves around central themes of skulls, death, pain, violence and hopelessness because as several artists told me, \""death and suffering is always mysterious  and cool. It's what's selling now.\"" Oh...kayyyyy...if it really is true that art reveals the character of a culture, then we are all probably in BIG, BIG trouble. I know better than to ever do that again to myself."
2,"I liked the price and the food wasn't bad either. The salad bar is small in comparison to many other buffets but who goes to a buffet and eats a salad?  Right? \n\nThey have a BBQ area, stir fry and make your own pasta stations, a Mexican food area and pizza and pastas. Oh and then there's dessert. I think they may actually have more dessert than food options. Soft serve, cakes and pies, gelato and sorbets and my dad's favorite: the bread pudding. \n\nI enjoyed the breakfast buffet with the omelet station and crisp bacon!  \n\nThe waitstaff that brought your beverages and took away your dirty plates were really nice and prompt with our drinks. \n\nI had to minus a star because of the cashiers. On one occasion the cashier was rude and charged us incorrectly even after we told her numerous times how many people were in our party. She was downright sassy commenting on other people being served near us \""oh there's another one, must a full mood out tonight\""."
3,"WHERE: Located in the plaza on Charleston & Sloan.\n\nWHEN: 10am-930pm, I believe.\n\nWHY: If you happened to just recently move around this side of town, and are desperately in need of some quick and great tasting Hawaiian food, look no further!\n\nWHAT: I had got off from work and straight home to some hungry brothers of mine! We debated on what type of food to eat, and came to conclude we were all craving some good old Hawaiian food! I would usually drive that 5 minutes to Island Flavor, but the 5 minutes actually became 35 minutes from our new place! Boohooo!!! =(\n\nI then decided to search on Yelp, and I was lucky enough to spot this SPOT. Muahaha!!\n\nFirst thing's first. We step in to order. My brother and I both get the chicken combo, while my other brother gets the local plate. (Most plates are 8 bucks and well-worth the 8 bucks!!) While we are waiting for our food, the server brings us a bowl of MISO SOUP!!! C'mon, who has ever had a side of miso at a hawaiian joint!! I say BOMB.COM!!! That right there = SOLD! Haha.\n\nAfter a minute or so, we got our actual combo plates. Fast service, I may add! I loved the chicken katsu, but my bbq chicken was on the bland side.  I could suggest adding a little bit more seasoning or even bbq sauce would have done the trick! Besides my bbq chicken, everything was splendid! I will definitely come back on those chicken katsu crave days!"
1,"Well since I used to live across from this place I always came here... but theres a BEAUTIFUL newer one just on Trop. It has shiz you need, and then some. I dont have a car so they would allow me to take the cart home when I had waters and such (ghetto, I KNOW!) But shooooot you gotta do whatchu gotta do!\n\nI did go there one night at like 7:59 and he beezy at the counter wouldnt make me a money order because she said the computer automattically closes down at 8pm... Her drawer was alwaready counted and the pc was already shut down BEFORE 8! Shes lucky I didnt get all ghetto on her gringa ace! \n\nAnyway, dont come here... go to the one on Trop!"
4,"Great event!\n\nThe only real problem is the time if the year. It's a little too hot, but I'm rating the event and not the weather.\n\nThis is by far one of the best Las Vegas beer festivals because of the location. It's nice to get a beer from a tent and then walk around before coming up on another tent. You really get to enjoy the beer at that point. The scenery at the Springs Preserve is something to enjoy as well.\n\nBlues entertainment goes on through the whole event. That part of the amphitheater is set up right next to a bunch of beer tents, which makes it nice to be able to grab a beer and then sit down on a blanket to listen to some music.\n\nThere is plenty of beer at this festival and many tents, so no real fear of long lines and empty cups. It can be difficult to navigate the beer map if you have never been to the Springs Preserve; however, that's part of the adventure. Many of the local breweries bring out some special beers or beers made just for the festival which make for some unique offerings.\n\nThere are different food spots located around the fest---whether it's a restaurant booth, a food truck, or some standard vendor BBQ. \n\nOne word of advice, HYDRATION!!!!! It's hot and there is great beer, but drink tons of water"
1,"Il Fornaio - New York, New York Casino \n\nWe have been to and heard of many Il Fornaio locations and we wanted to grab a quick Panino and a bowl of soup at the mid day mark to hold us over until later on. \n\nWe shared a Salami Panino (Panini is plural before you criticize....) & also a bowl of the lentil soup. \n\nI have to say.... OK at best is being nice.... \nThe panino came in a plastic wrapper and had little to no taste... also we found out as we were leaving that we could have had it toasted... hello... that's the idea.... The soup came in a cardboard \""to-go\"" container and was again just ok... and it was warm at best... \n\nJust not what I would expect from NY, NY and spending $15.... just not overly pleased with this. I guess when the bread they used hit the water we drank it expanded like an inner tube and we were full... \nMission accomplished.... I think...."
1,"Usually I'm a pretty big Mimi's Cafe fan. Usually... However, last night was a disappointment.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive, however, my mom's calamari came out like 10 minutes before my dad's and my meal. That was her main meal. We encouraged her to start stabbing those rings, but she sat and waited for us. My dad ordered a side salad. Didn't come. Had to ask for it and then came, but after steak/fries arrival. I ordered Mediterranean salad w/Clam Chowder. I had to remind the server about my soup. Five minutes later, she came back empty-handed and announced they were out. That's fine - it wasn't meant to be.\n\nMy salad included their WONDERFUL muffins. Again, had to remind server about this crucial part, as I'm infatuated w/the Honey Bran muffins. I took it home and violated it.\n\nAbout 15-20 minutes upon departure, I had sharp stabbing pains in my chest area. I took 2 Tums and it took the edge off. Took 2 more. Finally gone. They must have tossed battery acid w/their vinaigrette?!? Smmhhh\n\nSorry, Mimi's - not gonna be back anytime soon."
1,"Lately the music at Char's has deteriorated. The same 2 or 3 same bands play every night. It wouldn't be quite as bad if the bands learned some new songs but they play the same thing the same way every night -- and every band plays almost the same song list of tunes. Do we really need to hear \""Car Wash\"" and \""Mustang Sally\"" 7 days a week?\n\nDon't get me wrong -- the bands that play at Char's are good bands, but all of them are in a terrible rut.\n\nChar's desperately needs some new blood with different music if they want to continue to have a steady clientele. Char's is becoming boring and predictable -- and that is no way to keep a business strong when many other places are offering a far more interesting music fare."
2,"Cosmos Cafe is yet another venue that is really a restaurant, but doubles as a nightlife hot spot on the weekends.  North Carolina's laws on serving alcohol make it nearly impossible to just open a \""club\"", so you see a lot of these in Charlotte, especially downtown.  \n\nThe staff is super friendly and doesn't hassle you for walking in and realizing \""Saturday night\"" hasn't started yet because the dining patrons still haven't cleared out.  So don't be afraid to check it at 11pm and then come back again at midnight or 1 if it's still slow.  I've never been here to eat but it's a great place to stop in for a late night weekend drink to see what's going on.  People dress nice and behave well.  So you can actually get an expensive drink and not worry about someone elbowing it across the room.  \n\nThere's plenty of seating on both the first and second floors and they have a respectable, if predictable, Scotch selection that helps me keep them in mind when I'm downtown, so I'm sure the rest of the liquor options are pretty good.  Coming from  Illinois where you can buy booze at grocery stores, it's depressing to walk into a bar in Charlotte and only have one or two choices.  Cosmos expands the horizons and I appreciate that."
4,Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location.
1,"We have been here twice now.  We were told about it from a friend and we are all about trying new places.  Ok, Food good - thank you for organic and fresh squeezed OJ.  \n\nHowever, your staff lacks personality and they seem to be  \""deer in the head lights\"". There is a difference between a Server and an Order taker. So, far both times we've had Order takers.  \""Hi, are you ready?\""  Opposed to:  Hello, how are you guys?  Have you been here before?  Let me tell you about our daily specials and let me recommend a few of my favorites. Nope, we got, are you ready? -- both times.  Going to the counter to pay, again no personality, lifeless humans standing there doing a job.  \n\nManager(s), you may want to wander around and do table checks. I can tell you want this place to do well, but, with your LIFELESS staff, it's going to be a stretch to be successful.  I mean --  jeez, even at Denny's we get some personality.  \n\nThere is no personality here -- zombies, taking orders and doing a \""job.\""  Just because your organic, doesn't mean you need have lifeless attitudes. \n\nSay hi, be fun, enjoy your customers, look people in the eye, check up on tables regularly, and when its time for your NEW Clients to pay their bills --  this is when you should be asking your NEW clientele, \""How was your experience?\"" \n\nWe will try your restaurant one more time, but if it's the same next time - No more repeat visits for us.  For those who know good service -- it won't take long for  people to spread the word.  So,  Are you amazing or below average?  You choose. \n\nRight now, Your below average. \n\nI hope you'll take this review and \""Step it up!\""  Its very fixable right now.  \n\nSee you next time......I pray you can \""step it up\"" and bring some personality to your service staff. Right now, it's stale."
0,"I used to visit this place often and buy pretty much everything there.. I stopped going because I sent my girlfriend in to grab me some supplies and she told me this guy was a twat to her, this was about 7 months ago, I went in and confirmed he is indeed a twat, a chubby twat at that. I have since being going to a place on 19th ave and Camelback. \n\nI decided to go in and give it another go.. Nope, still got a chubby bearded twat working. I stood in front of him for 15 min trying juices.. Not one word to me and when another employee was helping me, she asked him if they had anymore of ____ juice.  He said he didn't know, that she should look in the back. Really? No shit? In the back? Maybe she asked twat if they had any because he was just sitting on his ass.. I dunno. Just maybe.."
0,"Giving this one star is being nice. Absolutely dreadful food and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. At one point we had to get up and walk across the restaurant to get our watiress's attention just to refill our water glass. When we finally did get our food, it was bland and uninspired. Started with the wings, they were overcooked and too chewy. They only gave us one little cup of ranch for 8 wings and when we asked for more they said they had to charge us. I got the burger and it was ok but I have had much better at even fast food restaurants. My girlfriend got some salad that was dry, so to cover that up they drenched it in dressing. It was inedible, we sent it back. The best part about that is they still tried to charge us for it on the bill. We had to argue for about 20 min to get it off. First with the waitress, then the asst manager, and finally the general manager. Was charging us $11 for a salad we had two bites of really worth ruining a customer's experience? I guess to this establishment it is. The main reason we went was to watch a game and I was so turned off with them trying to nickel and dime us, I left in the third quarter and went to the zipp's up the street. Good setup with the tvs, but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy."
2,"This is a good stop for travelers to grab cheap food and enjoy some drinks.  \n\nThey start off with a nice helping of chips and salsa.  The chips were an assortment of corn, fried dough like, and whole grain chips.  The salsa was nice and spicy, a great start.  We also ordered guacamole which was creamy and oniony.   \n\nWe came at the time the servers switched off and areas, so we had 3 different servers, but after we had our final server, he was courteous and took care of us.\n\nI had the desert fire pasta which was a big helping of spicy, cheesy penne pasta with shrimp.  It was really salty but still thought it was still good overall.\n\nMy co-worker had the fish tacos which was a nice large platter with black beans.  The sangria was delicious and you could have a choice of white or red."
3,"Crab in the micraddle of the desert?!!! \n\ni know - right?\n\nStill, the crab pots are great.  They show up at our table and there is a hush for about a half hour as we crack, crack, crack away.  Dungeness crabs are the best, being as I'm from the SF bay area I may be a bit prejudice, but try them all and just try to disagree with me, go ahead, do it.\n\nFried calamari was good.  \n\nAtmosphere is loud and fun.  I enjoy sitting at a table with a bucket right in the middle of the table for shell disposal.  Sat at a picnic bench their once and will NOT do that again, bum was sore afterwards.\n\nFriendly servers."
2,I love this place but without the owner being here the service sucks and the food sucks. I will be back like always but just hope they can get some consistency
0,"Really very disappointing experience. \n\n I got to the hotel at noon. They wanted $28 extra to check in before 3pm.  I refused, so I walked around the mall for a few hours then came back to check in.  No big deal, rules are rules.\n\nThe casino doesn't look like anything Hollywood.  It looks more like an abandoned set from a Beck video.  Leftover 70s glam, with the gold and rounded rectangles.  \n\nThey only offer free internet for only one device.  So I can use Wi-Fi on my laptop, but not on my phone or iPad.  Even McDonalds has free WiFi, I don't know why a big fancy hotel wouldn't.\n\nThey don't have any premium channels on TV.  Just Spike and Comedy Central.  This is Vegas, so you shouldn't be watching TV anyway, but I'm here on business so I am not going to be out partying.  I've stayed in dicey-ass weird motels in New Mexico that had better cable than Planet Hollywood.\n\nBut all of that was fine.  Cheap room, crappy amenities, right?  Well....\n\nAs I walked up to my room, the cleaning ladies were still in the hallway.  There was an empty 12 pack box of Pabst sitting in front of my door.  Nice, huh?  A sign of things to come.\n\nBoth the sheets and the comforter were stained.  There were huge 4\"" long orange dog hairs all over the room including on top of the comforter, and there was a weird Velcro mustache or something rolled up and thrown in the corner.  When I called to ask for new bedding, I got some attitude, and a comment that if there are extra people staying in the room they're going to charge me extra.  Nope, just me.  I didn't want EXTRA blankets, just CLEAN ones.  Just one person who doesn't want to sleep on top of someone else's stains and dog hair.  \n\nI've stayed at some really gross dive motels that were cleaner than this dump.  Pick a different hotel.  Do yourself a favor."
0,"Service was slow, eggs not crispy at edges and firm in center when ordering over hard.  I love oatmeal and this place charged more for it than starbucks next door.   Next doors starbucks had better tasting n consistency oatmeal at half the price.  The plates are large, but the food rather bland.   I just can't see eating here again.  I can see eating next door at Starbucks again.  Also, don't check in on yelp here.  The service are oblivious to the discount.  Overpriced place with bad food and a nice name.  I think it would have been healthier to not eat than eat here, despite the nice healthy name."
0,"Approaching 50 minutes into my wait, a sprint customer was playing on the tablets and appropriately decided to play \""Unchained melody\"" (ya know, with the lyric \""time goes by soo slowly\"") and I gave them a high five. Seriously. The two guys working this afternoon (Friday, April 11th) were the most unprofessional sales associates I've ever encountered. I understand that the phones were taking a while to switch over/ activate but their banter about what they wanted for lunch/dinner (they were deciding on glass nickel) and hearing how one of the guys working was about to stand up in his sisters wedding was too much for me. Waaaayyyy to much. I also heard all about the old sprint sales associate who just quit and how another pen called out to work today,\n\nNews flash-I came here to be waited on and get a new phone. Not hear about these guys personal lives. I wasn't even acknowledged as I walked into the store. \n\nI guess I don't get it. Where I work I keep my business to myself and I employ the tactic of multi tasking- not standing around discussing personal matters because whatever system that sets up phones was going slow.\n\nIt took them over an hour to tell me that activating my phone likely wouldn't happen today. I left immediately after. \n\nI won't be back-at least not the Middleton location. No way. No how. I totally get why they had an employee quit 3 days ago and another one call in sick. I'd quit or call in sick too if I worked here.\n\nGet your act together."
1,"Never had bad food or service but that was not the case at this location. \n\nWent in today for lunch. Ordered the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad and tea. \n\nThe server brought us our drinks but not all together. With very little ice, it was the only tea I drank, never asked about a refill. \n\nWe had to ask for a bread basket, which the flat bread was burnt. I'm surprised it was served to us, I know the guy dishing it out could tell, not sure why he still put it on the plate. \n\nMy salad came - appeared nice. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and there was no spice. The dressing is like a sour viniagrette, no kick there or really that much flavor.. then after digging into the salad, notice a lot of the lettuce had better days earlier that week. \n\nFinally saw the server again, we asked for the bill. \nWill try it out again, most likely another location."
0,"If I could I give no star, I would! Service was really really bad and racist! Food was overpriced and didn't taste good. This is one of the worst restaurant I have been too. Stay away!"
4,Been to this location three times and haven't had any significant problems so far. Chevy's has the best chips and salsa i've ever tasted and the food is delicious. Only complaint is that the restrooms don't have sensored towel dispensers. Not cool man.
4,"Yum! Burger is fantastic, and excited to try the tacos."
4,"I recently was in Little Italy and went to Impasto. Wow - absolutely outstanding!\nIt is hard to describe the food, a few words that come to mind are: incredible, delicious, addictive, fun, art!   \n\nArt - not in the looks (it looks ok), but in the taste, full of various delicious flavours in your mouth....\n\nService was excellent with an efficient and friendly waiter - well done !!!"
4,"Ice cream? What's that. You gotta try this place. It puts Ice cream to shame.  At first, I came here w/my brother and friend and I refused to eat there. I was stuffed. They bought a cup and gave me a spoon. It was sitting right there so I took a courtesy taste. Then another... then another... then another... Nielsen's wins. This tastes like ice cream but its soft and it tastes creamy. I can't even explain it other than you just need to try it once when you get chance. I promise you won't regret it."
0,I had the California burrito yesterday. And the potato's tasted raw and the meat tasted old and it was black. The only edible part of the burrito was the tortilla. I had a friend taste the burrito and he threw up from it. I was not happy. Not going back.
2,"I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed both the food and ambience.  The sushi is pretty decent, nothing \""wow,\"" but fair for a joint so close to the university.  I like the high energy of the place: it's pretty small, but Yama packs in a lot of people into that small space....like sardines, one may say.  On my last visit, my friends and I ordered the Manwhore, the spicy salmon roll (forget the name), chicken teriyaki, and a few maki rolls.  All were served fairly quickly and the rolls looked fairly fresh, not too much rice and a decent amount of fish.  \n\nThe AYCE deal is probably a great one for those with bottomless pits for stomachs.  I'd love to do that, but alas!, I have a limited capacity in my tummy.  \n\nA solid place for one's sushi craving."
4,"Recently had dinner at the Culinary Dropout and was very impressed.  The ambiance just takes you to a different place and the menu is wonderful and varied.  I had the french onion soup and beef stroganoff.  Both very tasty although the onion soup was a little sweet for my palette.  We decided to follow up the meal with the carmel corn and wow, what a treat.  This is a fun restaurant and the food is good.  A great night out."
4,"Let me start by saying that since I heard about Pizza Cono almost two weeks ago, I have literally been talking about it nonstop. I've been telling everyone how excited I was to try a pizza cone. Everyone. I have been as giddy as a school girl (to an annoying degree. Just ask my boyfriend.)\n\nTonight was finally the night! Justin took me to Pizza Cono to try it out. There were two gentleman working behind the counter and they were super nice. It's clear that the restaurant is very new and still working out the kinks, the large menu they have posted has changed and we used a menu that was on a laptop. They will have printed menus soon. They have a a wide variety of different pizza cones to choose from, although they are still missing a few ingredients for some of the cones. I got a Pepperoni Cone (pepperoni, marinara & cheese) and Justin got the Mafia Cone (pepperoni, bacon, sausage, marinara & cheese) and they were both really good. The crust was warm, the cheese was melty (but not messy) and it was easy enough to eat. I think it would be nice to grab one and window shop on Murray or Forbes. They were made-to-order and took about 10 minutes to come out, which was a little longer than I expected and I do worry about the timing if they were busier. \n\nFor dessert, we each got a Nutella Cone, which was similar to the Pizza Cones, but was a puff pastry-eque cone filled with nutella and topped with whipped cream. It was so good. It was a little messy there at the end, but I didn't care. You could put Nutella on cardboard and I'd probably eat it. \n\nThe atmosphere is interesting. The decor does leave a little to be desired, but since they are just starting out, it doesn't bother me too much. They were playing some kick-ass music, I heard Adele, N*SYNC, and even some Shaggy. I was not mad about the music. \n\nAll in all, my Pizza Cono experience was everything I wanted it to be. I will definitely be back. I think this little company has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see them grow."
1,"I was actually suprised when I went into this bar. I thought it would be better....is that wrong to say?!?!?! The ratio of guys to girls was at least 15 to 1. Which is fine and all but I can see why they offered free shots to girls. No cover to enter on the Thursday night I visited. And you could open a lingerie shop with the amount of bras hanging from the ceiling. The hot bartender with the awesome abs (she must have had ribs taken out and it is VERY clear she's never had a baby) was worth checking out, but that's pretty much it. I didn't get a drink at this stop so I can't comment on the price."
1,"Last time I ate here, I saw roaches running around. And that was the last time I ate there, food was blah, service was blah, I'm surprised the roaches even stick around."
2,Sushi was good but not amazing and for the price it should have been spectacular. Good service and decent crowd. Really expensive!
3,"I went today for lunch (Saturday) with my mom. The place was packed, but we found a table, and the service was fast, considering. I thought the food was great (Classic Smashburger, and we split some haystack onions and rosemary fries). My mom thought it was way too salty, but mine was fine.\n\nI would have given five stars, but here it is several hours later and I feel like I've been heavily dosed with MSG. Their menu says they don't use it, but their food is the only thing out of the ordinary that I've eaten today, and I can't get enough water and I feel hungover. My rings are tight and my mouth has that weird swollen tingly feeling that I only get from consuming MSG.\n\nGreat food, great service, not so great feeling later."
3,"We did sign up for this 24 hour deal and were able to cover four buffets. \n\nFirst stop was Caesars Palace for dinner; we were charged an additional $25.00 which was a big surprise since we were told earlier that it would be $15 extra. Fresh oysters were meh, although the snow crabs and shrimp were quite good.  We had a very friendly waiter who served us drinks.  In terms of ambiance, this was probably the best buffet.  Wait was 20 minutes at 5:30 p.m.on a weekday.\n\nWe went to Harrah's at 9:45 p.m.on  the same night.  They close at 10:00 p.m. So what was left was stale and and unappetizing.  However, I had one of the best shu-mai which was hidden under a bamboo basket which nobody knew was there.  Here again, the waiter was friendly and although we did not eat much, it was an okay meal.\n\nWe stood in line for 30 minutes the next day for breakfast at Le Village Buffet at Paris. They serve OJ's in a large glass and a pot of coffee to accompany your meal.  Good selection of breakfast fare, but I was impressed with their fresh fruits ~ sweetest pineapples and strawberries and juicy cantaloupes and melons.\n\nWe ventured to the Emperor's buffet at the Quad Resort, but found out that their buffet is for lunch only.  We also checked out Spice Market at PH and after reading the yelp reviews, we decided to go back to Le Village at Paris for dinner for our fourth buffet as time was ticking by.\n\nAgain we had a very friendly waitress at Le Village and we enjoyed our last dinner buffet.\n\nWould I do this deal again?  Yes, maybe if you choose the kind of foods that you like and do not indulge in the \""extras\"" and if you don't mind waiting in lines. Overall, due to the weekday stay, our wait was relatively short and service was excellent."
0,"Was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try. I was really reluctant since this restaurant serves Italian , Korean and Japanese. \n\nIt took forever for the server to show up after we were seated, so an automatic minus one star for that. \n\nAnd then when the waiter decided to come by , he was in an extreme hurry. \n\nOrdered the sushi combo, added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice. Also ordered the philly roll. \n\nWaited forever to get a refill for my drink forever. The only thing that they were fast at was giving us the bill, before we even finished eating!!!\n\nThe quality of the sushi was really bad, rice portion was lacking, the rolls were falling off and overstuffed with bland an unfresh generic seafood.\n\nThey forgot to get me my bowl of rice, this place is the worst sushi place ever. We also noticed that the people preparing the sushi were of Hispanic origin. That explains the sushi quality but it doesn't explain the jack of customer service."
4,"Ocean Floor offers an extensive selection of fish and supplies.  \n\nBeautiful tropical fish make this pet shop as fun as an aquarium you'd pay to gain entry to view.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff make really make this the number one place to buy fish in the valley."
3,This is the third time going.  It's clean and relaxing.  I've been going to Michael and he is very good.  I tell him the areas I need work on and he gets the knots out. I go there weekly and never have any problem tipping more than normal.
4,"Love this place, so glad to have a veg friendly cafe for when I'm in town visiting fam! Love the POM milk in my coffee...and the rest of the menu,well, I pretty much wanna eat it all! :)\n\nAlso, very friendly staff which is always a huge plus."
1,"Dang it, Zizi's! I did not want to be the big bad omnivore pissing in all the happy vegitarian's Cheerios. \n\nI wanted to loveyou so much that I finished lunch questioning whether I ever really needed to eat meat again. I purposely did not order a meat substitute dish for fear I would compare it to actual meat and not judge it on its own merits. But, man, my Mushroom Patty sub was capital b Bland. It didn't taste like mushrooms or carrots or spices, all of which your menu says are what make it. It DID taste like mayonaise (or probably Vegenaise) which the menu mentions nowhere, though I wish it did because I would have asked for it to be omitted. I even tried taking it off the sandwich so I could taste it apart from the bread, lettuce, onions and slightly underripe tomato. Still nothing. Sure it was filling but wheres the fun in that.\n\nThere were some high points. The wheat bread was delicious and the lettuce was some of the best i have had. I also appreciated that the onion were cut thin, presumably as to not overpower the minimal flavor the patty had. All this sort of amounts to the homliest girl at a party wearing a really killer dress, though.\n\nOne thing I know is that I'm going back for sure. I will consult with some friends who love Zizi's so much. I will find out what will wow me and I will order it. Because I know in my heart of hearts that they must be better than what I've seen."
4,"Wow.\nWow.\nWow.\n\nCavecreek isn't exactly a culinary destination but Cafe Bink is a step above the rest.  Set into \""downtown\"" Cavecreek (really just a quaint strip mall...but don't let that dissuade you), Cafe Binks has a premier setting in front of Black mountain and sunsets are just unreal while sitting on the patio.  The food is fantastic and the beer list is suprisingly delicious as well with breweries such as Dogfish Head.  The food is very much like homecooked, only if mom switched up the bacon for pork belly and manwiches for the best damn meat loaf EVER!  Coupled with the views and the comfortable desert evening temps, this place is phenomenal.  \n\nSure you can go to the original Binkley's down the street if you want a little more well to do atmosphere, but for a casual meal and drink Cafe Bink is it.  Tell all your friends that the best meal you've had in a while was at a strip mall."
1,"Very short review, Village Inn let down today. It was Wednesday, which means it was free pie day. Usually when you're done with the meal, or when they bring out your food, they'd either ask you, \""are you getting a free slice of pie today?\"" This is probably the first time it has happened. A free pie wasn't even mentioned. I didn't just order a drink to get a free slice of pie, I ordered a full breakfast item with a coffee."
4,"Happy Hour until 7pm- this is fantastic, many places end HH at 6pm so this was a nice bonus.  1/2 price appetizers as well.  We had the deviled eggs, lamb chops and chicken wings.  It was a lot of food with a lot of great flavors!  The lamb chops were delicious, cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of seasoning.  \n\nThe crowd for a Tuesday was mellow, there was live music.  \n\nA great spot for a meal or just drinks.  The Garage may be one of my new favorite picks!"
3,REALLY good. If their guacamole was as good as Chipotle's they would be five stars for sure
0,"I am basing my rating on my attempt to eat at Pamplemousse.  I was just visiting for the week and I've eaten at the Pamplemousse in Del Mar (San Diego County), so I wanted to try one in Vegas.  We showed up for lunch after seeing the sign that says open for lunch.  We walk up to the door and it's locked.  We see through the window that there is a sign that says, \""open for lunch\"" but no one is coming to the door.  So we walk back to the car and try calling the number.  A women answers and tells us that they are open for lunch except on Wednesday's.  As we are leaving, someone comes out and puts a sign on the door to say they aren't serving lunch (now they tell us!)\n\nO.K., these things happen so we decide to give it another try on Thursday.  We drive all the way back up to the restaurant and sure enough the door is open and we walk in.  No one is around.  No one in the restaurant, no one answering the phone after the 8th ring and no one to greet us.  So we are standing there at the podium for about 5 minutes, we even grab our own menu's just to get the jump on the ordering.  As we are standing there we hear people in the kitchen but still no one comes out.  Finally, we decided if this is how it is before we even get seated than we had enough.  So we left. \n\nNeedless to say, we really felt that this experience was inexcusable!"
0,"Poorly executed. $10 admission that got u.... nothing. Ridiculous $$$$ food, 4 hour lines, many trucks out of food at 6pm!"
2,"As mentioned many times in reviews, Slice of Vegas is overpriced for what you get. The environment is fun and welcoming. It would be great for a group of friends and they have TV's  all over so you can catch a game from any seat in the place. The hostess was friendly. The server was nice but seemed to be robotic in his approach. \n\nIt was not very busy when I dined here and service was mostly prompt. TV's were everywhere but the volume was not too loud so you can easily have conversations with your group while dining and watch the games. \n\nThe pizza was very good, NOT great but very good. Ordering a small (12') will set you back $20. It is good but not at all worth that price even being in Mandalay Place. The cocktails were well made. The presentation was weak but the flavor was perfect. The What's 6\"" and hard  is cucumber Efiin and very refreshing. The Mob-a-rita is an Italian Margarita and also quite nice, They do pour a little heavy handed but the balance is still nice for the cocktails. $14 for cocktails and they are about 10 ounces. \n\nThe concept is good, the atmosphere is fun and the food is pretty good. The cocktails were the star but when considering the price of everything I can't give it more than 3 stars. It is nice to grab a bite before a show at the House of Blues or if you are shopping but it is not worth making a special trip to check out.  Much better in concept than reality."
0,"I grew up here and have been coming to Papa Dels since 1976. It sure has gotten mediocre.\n\nWent here today for lunch and first off the restaurant needs an update (this building dates from the 1990s if memory serves when the original location on 6th St. closed). It's ratty looking with a huge stain on the ceiling where the wallpaper has peeled off. Fix it. How hard can that be?\n\nThe dough for the pizza (we ordered slices) has always been on the bready side, but I used to like that since it was moist and flavorful. This was dry as dust, lacking in sauce and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. Blech.\n\nAnd seriously. It's not 1976 anymore. A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it.\n\nMy nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored. No cheese, garlic, butter or anything. Just batons of dry bread. Again, gross.\n\nSad that an old institution has gone so far downhill."
0,Food is average. I'm a big fan of chips and salsa when it comes to Mexican restaurants. This place does not cut it. I've eaten here about 4 times and it's not for me. I'd rather eat at La Canasta now that's good authentic Mexican food.
3,"A bit pricey, but not too pricey. Really good drinks."
0,"I wish I had read the reviews before renting through Payless.  Got a good deal on a minivan through Priceline ($32/day) and my only concern was making sure they were located at the main rental car center and not off site.  Had I known that the experience would be so bad, I would've paid more to go through a different company.  Here goes:\n\nFirst, got up to the counter at around 9:30pm with 4 people being served by three employees and the manager.  There was one person in front of me in line, but I figured it would be a short wait since they had 4 stations working.  Wrong!  During the 20-minute wait one of the workers went on break and the manager disappeared into the back office.\n\nOnce I got up to the desk out came the sales pitches.  I've rented cars before so I'm used to it, but these guys really push it.  He asked why I chose a minivan since I was by myself and I explained that I needed the cargo space for luggage.  He then tried to get me to upgrade to a Toyota Sienna because the Dodge Caravan I would be getting did not have stow-away seats.  In the last dozen or so times I have rented a Dodge Caravan, all of them had stow-away seats but with this guy's sales pitch I figured Payless would be shady enough to purposely buy the vans without stow away seats.   I asked how much the upgrade was ($14/day) and declined and said I would be ok with putting the luggage on the seats since the initial rental was only $32/day.  He then offered it to me for $12/day and then $10/day.  Seriously?  Such a shady practice.  (I'll come back to this).  Then came the insurance sales, prepaid gas, extra driver, etc. No, no, no, you've kept me waiting over 30 minutes now and I just want to get the heck out of here.\n\nGot down to the garage to get my minivan and the employees down there were much more helpful.  Got the keys and inspected my Volkswagon minivan which was top of the line and had stow-away seats!  Pissed off now because the sales guy lied to me about the Dodge Caravan without folding seats!  Traveler's tip: use your cell phone to take a video as you inspect your car (to prove any dings/dents/etc were already there when you got the car).  The car was pretty dirty: bugs splattered all over the front and windshield, stains on the seats and floors, etc.  Started it up and the check oil light came on!  Great, talked to the employees and they gave me a new set of keys for a different minivan and said they would have the paperwork done by the time I got back from inspecting it.  This time it was a Toyota Sienna.  Same issues with it having bugs splattered all over the windshield and front, dirty floors, dirty seats, but this one didn't have the check oil light.  After 1.5 hrs, I was finally on my way with a dirty minivan which I promptly drove to a gas station to clean the windshield.\n\nReturn was simple and easy and the guy even let me leave an empty water bottle in the cup holder since they didn't have a trash can nearby.  If they charge me for cleaning in, I'll update this review."
1,"The Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a well thought out plan. A nice resturant located inside of a casino. The initial waiting time was about and hour and a half, which to our standards was a pretty long time. When we got to the front of the line, we were very excited, and even more so when we were seated. The servers were very nice, and the staff was full. We ordered burgers, obviously, I ordered mine medium well. When the food came, my burger was well done, maybe even a little charred. I was starving, but I didn't really care. The burger itself was delicious, and as usual, I like to put ketchup on it. The ketchup they provided was a odd concoction of chipotle, vinegar, and regular ketchup, watered down. I have many allergies, and after I ate the burger, I felt like I was allergic to the burger some how. \n\nAmbiance- Beautiful \nStaff- Awesome \nWaiting Time- Horrible\nFood- Moderate\nThank you."
0,"Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots, but $15 for a pillow? When I can get the same one at Target or Walmart..Methinks not."
3,"Another valley must have!  If you've lived here in Arizona for a while, then you've heard of Miracle Mile Deli.  They've been very popular in the valley for some time, and for good reason.  Some of the best deli foods served anywhere, at a decent price, and very clean.  I saw someone comment that the place reminded them of a hospital with it's cleanliness. Well, it is very clean, but not to the point of not wanting to be there...that's silly.  Always good service and very quick.  I will always recommend this Deli to friends."
4,"I had the chicken enchiladas with green chili sauce. Moist, flavorful, spicy, and delicious. Reasonable prices and actually spicy salsa with our free chips. Basic, casual atmosphere (which I prefer). Friendly staff. I definitely recommend this place."
1,"It pains me to write this review, it really does. I really wanted to like this place, I've heard amazing things about the Tempe location (which unfortunately I haven't been to) and was excited that there was a location nearby to visit. The location itself is really cute. It kind of reminds me of NCounter in Tempe. \n\nPositives: \n-It's a really cute cafe. The decor is kitschy and cute, with a huge mixer in the front. I like the overall minimalist design.\n-I like the fact that you order at the counter, even though in a large group it can be a little annoying to have food come out in rounds. \n-I can see why people come here, for the baked goods. I got a chocolate croissant to share with my group and everyone agreed it was delicious. \n-The food was pretty delicious. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and the banana caramel sauce is to die for.\n\nOnto the unfortunate negatives:\n\nIssue #1: The staff was inconsistent. Either they were overly friendly & attentive or couldn't be bothered. Case in point-The lady who took my order was very friendly & peppy. She was very helpful at offering suggestions and even up sold me on getting a pastry to share with my group while we waited for our food. Once we got our food, it was difficult to flag any of the staff down if we needed anything and if we were successful-it took an awfully long time to get what we asked for. \n\nIssue #2: My friend and I ordered the exact same dish but got different amounts of food. My friend noted that she felt it was overpriced for what she was getting, but then was kind of upset to see that my order had way more potatoes than hers did. There should be a standard there, especially if it's pretty obvious we're at the same table?\n\nIssue #3: The amount of time it took for our food to arrive. I understand if you're like crazy busy, but it was only moderate on our visit. Each of us pretty much ate our entire meal before the next person got their food. I understand we ordered separately but the timing was pretty close between orders. \n\nPerhaps this place is experiencing growing pains? I don't know. I'd like to make a return visit, but I will probably wait a bit. Hopefully I can update this review with more stars."
0,"Worst service ever. Irresponsible.\n\nI lost a package that was full of my cloths and art supplies with their service. They never told me that one of my package was missing before i ask for it. They just delivered rest of two boxes. i spent two weeks trying to contact them and trying to figure why my package is in transit for three weeks. They answered extremely late and never knew where the package was or about any of process that it had gone through.\n\nCouldn't deal this matter directly with Fedex because i used college box's account, not mine and which NEVER give a shit about the lost bag. After endless waiting and stupid chatting that gives no solution at all, i got a call from Fedex that it was delivered it to a wrong address. I had to request the College Boxes to request a call tag to the Fedex and wait untill the Fedex tell the college box if they found it or not and the college box tells me about it. BUT the college box never contacts you about any of answer before you ask them after getting tired of waiting. The college box even deactivated my account which has all the information with it as September came saying that i have no service going on with them. \n\nEventually i could not find the package and DID NOT GET THE REFUND for the lost items even if i paid for the insurance saying that i have $200 worthy items in my package. \n\nIt happened in August and i got the answer from them today which is November. They did not even notified that i will not get the refund. I had to ask them and wait for the mail that i have to wait more and repeating that again and again for three months. \nThey give a single sentence as a reply to your paragraph-long question and bagging for help to find the package back. I paid about $300 for three boxes and got only two package back.\n\nThis experience ruined my first months of college.\nDon't ever use this company.. it is a risk. Rather use just the Fedex."
3,Place is so cool!  The waiters look like theyre using their cell phones yet theyre actually placing your order on phones. Our drinks arrived while our waiter was still taking our order. Now that's impressive! Awesome food as well and good pricing!
4,"Wow!  I called based this company based on a Yelp review I found this AM.  This guy/business owner answered his phone right away and set up an appointment for me the same day which was this afternoon.  He showed up on time - was friendly, clean and professional.  He also charged me a VERY fair rate!  \n\nHis work was perfection.  My couch looks brand new, my 5 year old son's carpet looks wonderfully clean and my cool modern White Shag area carpet looks great (again!)\n\nWonderful company!  Highly recommeded! :)\n\nSandra"
1,"Was not impressed. The seaweed salad was drowned in sesame oil and every roll was entirely overwhelmed by sauce (there was a quarter cup of garlic sauce left on the plate when we finished the Primo roll, no hint of exaggeration.) And for a place that charges for forks, you'd think they'd pack the rolls a little tighter so they don't utterly disintegrate. It was heavy, heavy fare and we left feeling overfull and gross even though we ate about half as much as we usually do on sushi night (and both had gas pains for a couple of hours afterward).\n\nThe free strawberry ice cream was not delicious and the fortune cookie was downright weird."
1,"Great service. Overpriced food. We went here for dinner while in Vegas. I had the cioppino and my girlfriend had the New Zealand filet mignon. The sides are a la carte but they are huge, enough for 4 people. However, the entree portions are not big at all. My cioppino was overpriced for the portion size, and you don't get salads included. The wine prices were also very high. In all, the service was great but the food does not justify the price in my opinion. Eat here only if you have a coupon or discount and it would probably be worth it."
2,"Well I definitely enjoy the Go or Fab rooms. The pool area is huge and tropical and you can easily spend all day there. Ive never had a disappointing experience at the Flamingo. Years ago, the buffet was terrible but im unsure if thats changed or not. The new food court is convenient and all the bars have awesome stylish souvenir glasses!!!"
3,"I love Todai's mostly because I love sushi in general. I love all you can eat even more. Put those together and you have a great place to have a meal. If you like sushi, they have quite a few choices and they have a full Japanese buffet in addition to the sushi.\n\nThe only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because you have to get up and walk back to the buffet line if you want napkins, so don't forget them. I think napkin holders would be a good investment because getting back up when you're ready to eat is inconvenient. \n\nThe waiters aren't very personable either. They don't say much, but that's not such a big deal. It cost $35 per person last time we went (about a month ago), so its not too hard on your wallet."
0,"Terrible breakfast. Don't, bother. I had a crappy bagel sandwich.  I should have hit McDonalds."
2,"I haven't been to putt putt in years, so coming here made me super nerdy anxious all wrapped into one giant golf ball. King Putt was pretty cool and I did have a good time. I came here on a double date with two other friends and we ended up having a really good time, letting competition run the show at some points. \n\nFor students, it's a really good bargain because entrance prices are just $7. It was not really busy and we went on a Friday night! Basically you pay at the front and you get to choose your glow in the dark gold ball from the array of choices. Keep in mind this is a glow in the dark experience and it made it all the more fun. There are 18 holes, like normal golf, and each presents itself with a different challenge. The courses were actually pretty fun and had required some decision making, leading to a more competitive atmosphere. It was unique and not cheesy. \n\nThe good thing about this place is that it's not designed to be a quick round of putt putt. Nor is it designed to keep you there for hours on end. There were four of us and we were there for all 18 holes for a little over an hour if that. It was the perfect pace and I never felt rushed or like we were there for a long time. The disappointment was minor, because the last hole was just you returning your ball. BUT in exchange you can get tickets to trade for some prizes. The girls got some candy and tattoos. \n\nThis place does offer more amenities like an arcade, a restaurant and even laser tag. I think this would be a fun place to take the family or have a birthday at, as they have party rooms. With that said, I recommend this place and I'd definitely come back."
3,"A nice independent restaurant very worthy of customer support. The fish, particularly the Walleye, and steak dishes are all good and if the duck special with Door County cherries is available I highly recommend it.  Top notch! The Very Berry Grilled Chicken Salad was also delicious."
0,"I brought my car for a diagnostic service due to a failed emission inspection. \nThe Suzuki XL7 is only 5 years old. It seems I changed my battery about 10 months ago and i didn't reset a sensor.\nI brought it to Auto Tech with a coupon from a newspaper.\nOne hour after I dropped the car off they called me and said it's done. \nAll they did was run a sequence and that's all they did! A few button pushes and ten seconds it's done! $120!!!\nI presented the coupon just after he swiped my card for $120! The guy said \""Oh... I can't honor that! I already swiped your card!\""\n\nI run a retail store and I'd simply void the transaction and redo it, honoring the coupon.\nThe guy said \""you can use this coupon the next time you come in.\""\nLOL! Does he think I'm that stupid? I'm never going back! \n\nThis is the second incident I had with this place. The last time I was there, about two years ago, I went for an oil change at 8:00AM. They said \""You're the first one\"" \nAn hour later a pretty woman went in and they did her car before mine. No reason. I asked the service tech \""Is my car done?\"" he said. OH... I'll get on yours right away... \n\nI promised NEVER again back then."
4,Excellent food and margaritas!!
1,This is an average bar. They have the run of the mill drinks everything else there. The service wasn't bad..but it didn't impress me. I do like the fact that they have good local brews on tap. Other than that....you can find a better bar in Charlotte.
1,"I wish I would've rather stayed at Flamingo for the same price. Harrah's was a big let down. The service was very rude and unfriendly. They gave free tickets for a comdey show on check-in but forgot to mention that uh..the show had been cancelled for the whole week (didn't even exchange tickets for some other show). We had confirmed our booking on their website for a non-smoking king, but after standing in long line for almost 30 mins they say that they only have handicapped rooms left. So they offered to upgrade to deluxe room with strip-view in mardi gras towers, which had no strip view and wasn't deluxe at all. \n\nSo we asked to give us our standard room back and accepted one with 2 queen beds in the Carnaval tower, which was infact slightly bigger and even had a better view than the previous more expensive room. There was no coffee machine in the room, the TV was kinda old and the beds weren't so comfy either. The rooms were quite noisy and not the cleanest either. The Carnaval court was closed for all 3 days and nights. The location is good (but I guess with the new city center, the Harrah's and Venetian's part of the strip is not so happening anymore.) The cafe was decent for breakfast but we ate our other meals elsewhere. The casino feels old and stinky.\n\nOverall, the hotel is not that great and the service is poor. I would rather stay elsewhere next time."
2,"I didn't had the Pho here but my friend did and I tasted her broth, and well it WAS GOOD! It was really flavorful of Pho!  I think she had the pho tai chinh.  I however, had the Broccoli Beef w/ Rice and woww I loved it so much.  The sauce was awesome.  It had a sweet taste to it.  The pho was overpriced but hey, what did you expect from Treasure Island?  The ambiance was nice, dim light and all but the service was pretty bad.  We had to wait over 15mins for our check and there wasn't even a full house.\n\n-1 star for service\n-1 star over price\n\nI would definatelly come back.  Pho wasn't so bad and where can you get pho at like 4am in the morning while you're in Vegas? xD"
2,"\""Reputation is Everything.\""\n\nThat is, assuming it's a good one, which The Buffet at the Bellagio seems to still have (100 people waiting in line!).  It's just a shame that the food can't back that up anymore.  While they were pretty darn good the last time I was here, The Buffet now seems to be living off its reputation more than anything else.\n\nAlthough there were about 40 people in line when we arrived (it more than doubled by the time we left), we were able to bypass the wait by making a reservation.  The trade off was a fixed 18% gratuity, but it was well worth it to get in that much faster and to have all 12 of us seated together.  Plus, we probably would have tipped that much anyways.\n\nOn the plus side, there was a wide variety to choose from.  Like nearly every other Vegas buffet, there were sections for Asian food, sushi/sashimi, seasonal fruits, various salads, pastas, pizzas, and seafood (including fresh king crab legs).  In addition, they also had a couple of carvery stations offering meaty favorites like prime rib, Kobe beef, ribs, pork belly, and rack of lamb, as well as stations for made-to-order tacos and caviar.  And, of course, a dessert bar with a wealth of selections to cap your meal.\n\nWhile all that variety was great, it was also necessary in order to find things worth eating.  Most of the food was just okay with a handful of tasty items, but the carvery meats were really disappointing though - the prime rib was okay and the rack of lamb was good, but the Kobe beef was AWFUL (tough and flavorless).  Furthermore, the tacos were pretty bleh, two of the three caviars were just tobiko and ikura (like at Japanese restaurants), and the sashimi didn't look appetizing at all.\n\nAt $39 a head for a regular Saturday night dinner, the price is comparable with the better buffets on the Strip (Wynn's buffet and Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, for two), but the food felt like it was a step or two behind.  TWO AND A HALF STARS rounded up because things like the salmon mousse cups, smoked salmon, chocolate covered strawberries, and rack of lamb were \""plus\"" items.  Plus, a part of me just hopes that it was a bad night.  However, if I had to paid out of my pocket (the resort credit I got for staying at the Bellagio covered my meal), I would have rounded down."
1,"Sometimes when you have a layover (ok yes I could have driven home and driven back, but it seemed easier to just chill at the airport) you just need somewhere to hang out. \n\nPros: \nCheap beers! Get the huge ones.. you might be waiting awhile.\nLuckly we didn't have the service issues that Gavin did.\n\nCons:\nBaseball was on, yet they would only turn on the freaking X games on every TV. Who the hell watches the X games.. yuck. \nFood looked sick. It's all preprepped (who knows how long it's been there) total crap food. The salads are in a shaker thing. \n\nHonestly people, the food at McCarran sucks really hard. I always recommend buying a sandwich and bringing it with you. $10 subway? suck. $12 sandwiches from wolfgang puck that look old and gross? suck. Jose Cuervo bar and grill ? are you kidding me? Anyways, note to everyone, do whatever you can to avoid eating at the airport !"
1,"Purchased a condo Feb 2011 and needed a knob for the water shut off fixed. They came out handled it and gave me great service. I paid the first payment for the service call with my debit before they fixed it and then after it was fixed I paid again. Over the last 15 months I have received 3 calls from them saying I didn't pay, after getting a message last month again I called them back and talked to a very nice lady who said not to worry she would take care of it. Again today I get a call from a woman claiming to be a manager advising me I have a past due balance and I needed to pay ASAP!!! I again told her I had already paid and she began to argue with me. I asked her if I really owed this \""balance\"" why it took 15 months for them to take care of it, she basically called me a liar and I asked to talk to her manager, and she stated she was it ( she didn't have a manager ) I then asked who the owner was and asked to be transferred to his voicemail, she said he didn't have voicemail and refused to allow me to speak to anyone else. I finally told her if she didn't stop harassing me I would file a claim with the BBB and hung up. Seriously they need a better bookkeeper and need better customer service!!!"
2,"We have only had breakfast here, the food is very good but the service is very slow.  The steak and egg special for $9.99 is delicious and the hash browns are out of this world.  If only the service were better.  The servers are friendly (McKenzie) but there is no urgency in serving the customers.  Dining area could use a remodel as well.  Prices are reasonable."
1,"The slowest chipotle by far, be ready to wait ...\n\nIt was Saturday evening and the place was packed!!! The line was going out the door. I am used to long lines at Chipotle, but they usually move pretty fast. People who work there are always very quick and on top of their tasks. Well not the case here. I understand that work area needs to be cleaned and more food ordered, but when you have 20 people waiting in line forever you have to move. My bf walked over to Paradise Bakery, waited in line there, had his sandwich prepared, walked back and still waited about 5-8 minutes with me. Only I I wasn't that hungry, no way I would wait that long"
1,"I'm disappointed in the housekeeping quality.  We booked a fountain view room, nice view, but bed sheet was not clean.  I asked housekeeping to replace the sheet, but after 20 minutes and 2 calls they finically found someone to give me new sheet.  I didn't expect to change bed sheet at a 5 five star hotel."
2,"I liked this place.  We got in super quick, because my friend was on a list.  The drinks were expensive, but I also expected that.  It's a decent club, but once again, it's like the DJ has ADD.  I don't understand playing a song and then playing another song 20 seconds later.  It's ANNOYING.  And how do you get your dancing groove on?  You can't because the DJ changes up the music too much."
0,"I rented my car from Advantage and thought that I was getting a pretty good deal for my car. The rates were low, and I bought insurance for the car at a pretty low price. I was just upset with the service that I received. As soon as I got there, the man at the desk decided he was going to give me a lecture on how I should upgrade my insurance (even though I already had it). He also had me sign a contract (you know how it goes) but as I was standing there trying to read what I was going to sign he simply kept telling me (hurry and sign, I already explained everything to you) I snapped at him and told him I was trying to read anyway.\n\nThe care was okay, I got a Kia that was easy to drive. And returning the car was not that bad at all. I just had one problem when I returned my car. They didn't give me any time to check and see if I left anything behind and low and behold I did!  When I got back to the hotel, I made a phone call to the lost and found desk (which was a machine by the way) and they told me they didn't have anything. How do you have a lost and found desk and not give anything back to the customer?\n\nService - bad"
4,"I've never had a bad meal here.  Great atmosphere, caring staff, and one of the best half chickens with sweet creamed corn I've ever had.  If you're on a date order a bottle of bubbly (they have one for $42 and it's excellent) have some muscles and potstickers, split a wedge salad and enjoy!  The pineapple upside down cake is a great choice for dessert.  Simple honest food, nuff said."

4,"Let me start by saying that Charlotte is a pretty weak food town.  Look, I ain't hatin' on Charlotte: just tellin' the truth.  \n\nYou really have to get lucky to find a place that does anything authentic/ethnic.  There are a few decent Mexican places if you know where to look, and some good Vietnamese here and there.  Or you can go downtown and pay through the nose for one of the decent chef-driven joints.  But simply put, Charlotte just doesn't have the diversity that a city this size would have, were it found up North.  The food scene is just pretty lame.  \n\nBut it is improving slowly.  And the way to help it improve is to support a restaurant like Taste of Europe.\n\nThey are turning out delicious Polish food here at reasonable prices.  I agree with everything said in the previous reviews.  The food is great, all around.  The place is clean.  The service is wonderful.\n\nWe rarely go out to eat because I can cook better food than most restaurants can around here.  My pizza is better.  My Chinese is better.  My Italian is better.  My steaks, hamburgers, BBQ--better, better, better.  My Polish?  Yeah, it's darn good, but Taste of Europe is better.  So we will be back!"
0,Who ever rated more than 1 start doesn't know real Chinese food! I regret spending a penny there. And also the staff and service are terrible how do these people even gave a job.
3,"Love, love, love this place!\nGreat atmosphere, great for large groups, casual and fun! Have been here a number of times, and have yet to be let down.\nOrder the sweet potato tater tots! Oh my goodness! Life changing!!!"
3,My friends and I had such a great time here! The entertainment was catchy and fun and the waitress was always there when we needed her! I highly recommend visiting New York New York one night to sing along with the dueling pianos
1,"It's better than Taco Bell.\n\nIf you're looking for an American's take on Mexican food, 3 Amigos is a winner. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food... Keep looking... You won't find any of it here."
2,"Real quickly, this is what we had and our opinions: bruschetta (lacked burst of flavor of which we are accustomed); carpaccio (was not thinly sliced or raw, rather tasted like thinly sliced salami); pizza (very good, but not to the crust, meaning we left the \""ends\""); Nutella tort (heavy like a brownie and delicious); tiramisu (light and delicious like it should be). Service: had two of three water glasses empty for 5 minutes before I gave up and asked for some more; meanwhile, 2-3 employees appeared to have been available to accommodate us."
2,"Went here on vacation with some friends. The place was packed. \nThere was no cover. Very good bartenders. The bartenders are super quick with drinks, even though the place had tons of people. The music was not really my thing, but I still had a great time. The music is very loud, but they have a great outside area."
3,Came to eat here because hakkasan line was wayyy too long and I didn't want to wait. Plus we wouldn't have made it in time for guestlist.\nWe got wings as an appetizer and they were pretty good! Crispy yet juicy.\nMy man got the spaghetti pasta which was delicious!! The sauce to meat ratio was perfect! He wasn't able to finish it all. \nI got the burger with fries. The fries were so crispy and good! I was only able to finish half of my meal so we got a togo box and had a delicious midnight snack. \nOverall the dining expletive was okay. Our waiter only checked up on us once...
1,"are you seriously telling me this place is affilated with Cheesecake factory?? \n\nwe stayed at the the Palazzo, so naturally we choose to eat within our hotel. BAD F-EN mistake. everything we order was awful or nasty. Zen Noodles, YUCK!!!!! NO! bland bland bland. better off with chicken noodle soup but THEY DON'T make that. Chicken and Waffles, my friend said it was 'horrific' and 'nasty' i didn't try it but looking at her expressions tells me im better off NOT trying it. seared ahi... wow, is this seriously \""AHI\""?!?!? I had the Pasta with Chicken Tomatoes and Garlic over creamy sauce, the pasta itself was overcooked!!! :( My friend had the Caramel chicken and Sauteed Beef. we aske dher, hey what did you ordered? She said \""awful\"" practically renamed her plate. I ordered the Creamy Chicken Soup. CREAMY is a understatement, i took 2 spoonful and gave up! GROSS, creamy... well it was WAY THE HELL beyond creamy because when he cooled it looked like BUTTER! i think they only good plate that no one complained about was Shrimp Scampi. So if you're as unfortunately as us and was forced to eat there because Palazzo and Venetian didn't have any food places opened after 3AM, then order yourself a Shrimp Scampi.. because everything else on the menu is \""HORRIBLE, AWFUL and NASTY\"" \n\nService was great, well, how can it possibly be NOT GREAT being that it is in the the Palazzo?? but food wise, walk to DENNY'S!! You'll be better off eatting there."
4,"$5 movie gets 5 stars from me.  Especially when I had no idea their Tuesday matinees were so cheap, I just wanted to squeeze in a flick with a little shopping.'\nThe chairs are comfy and the location leads to some great multitasking after the film, I will definitely be back."
0,"Wow. I am not a fan.\n\nWas visiting my parents this afternoon, and saw my mom had an ULTA catalog. I saw the new OPI line (san Francisco) and my mom saw a color she liked, and we decided to check it out.\n\nNot only could we not find the OPI San Fran collection.... No one from the store even offered to help us. Walking around and hunting for it, the store manager and another employee were chit chatting away, while we are looking. They didn't even stop to see if we needed anything.... We didn't even get a hello, or a nod. \n\nMy mother interrupted them, and politely asked where we could find the collection. We were guided, and wow, were we disappointed.\n\nThe colors weren't even close as pictured.... They should fire their photographer. \n\nI wanted to smell a sample of perfume by Jimmy Choo, but there was no sample. We asked an associate if we could be \""assisted\"".\n\nHer answer was there was no sample. Not in the entire store, and no one knows where it is.\n\n\nSeriously?"
3,"Yo G.  Kind vittles.  you know how to make some tasty food.  Chili cheese fries are seriously right on.  cheesesteaks are all good.  Confusing place though.  the menu, the ordering is all confusing.  Not always sure who is an employee, not always greated by anyone.  Should be asked if you have been here before or have any questions.  Good vittles"
0,"Never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me. Hands down the worst meal I have ever eaten and the worst $20 I have ever spent. I have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied. You could not pay me $20 to eat the food I ordered again.\n\nWe were starving. Neither of us had eaten all day. The first thing we did was order the Nachos. It came with \""Nacho\"" liquid cheese you find at gas stations and sporting events. I am talking the pasty orange processed shit, pun fucking intended. They dumped this shit all over a giant plate of chips and sprinkled on some seasoned ground beef and charged us $9. \n\nN-I-N-E FUCKING DOLLARS. If I'm paying $9 for tortilla chips and cheese, I expect actual cheese, not processed liquid cheese that I can buy at Costco in eighty pound bags for $15. That's 10 cents an ounce. There was *maybe* 3 ounces of cheese on my chips. That's 30 cents of cheese which is arguably the most expensive ingredient of the dish. The entire plate of nachos probably cost them $1. \n\nWe did not finish them. We each ate around six or seven Nacho cheese coated chips before we were saved by our entrees. Lucky us, or so we thought. Apparently \""smothered\"" burritos actually means fucking coated with Nacho cheese. Fuck. You can tell I really hate this shit. Let's move on.\n\nMy $14 entree consisted of 2 tacos, 1 mini burrito, and a chimichanga. The beef in my tacos was ground fine. Real fine. So fine that you could no longer tell what part of the cow a particular granule came from. All I can say was that it was better than the refried beans of the \""just add water\"" variety. Not joking. The beans were the texture of a watery soup. I think the cook added too much water to mine because when I got the plate the beans were on the left side. By the end of the meal they had oozed across the entire plate like a thick viscous creature. Like all \""just add water\"" refried beans of jail cafeteria quality, it tasted like cardboard.\n\nThe chicken taco was edible. I think. I ate it at least. I was starving though. Again, we hadn't eaten all day. I didn't touch the Nacho cheese coated burritos. I tried the chimichanga last. I had two bites.\n\nThe rice was the best thing on the plate.\n\nThe service was as good as it possibly could have been. You could tell the servers did not like working there. Our server didn't bring us the check. He had the busser/dishwasher bring us the check. I don't blame him. Honestly, we felt sorry for him."
3,"BOOBS .. that is all this show is about .. lol, well not really... they do show a lot of boobs though ... just a warning.\n\nZumanity was hilarious.  Yes it's not as acrobatic as O or Ka (which I have seen so I can compare) but it's entertaining.  I was laughing for about 70% of the show.  If you go in having low expectations, you come out smiling and happy that you gave it a chance.\n\nOn an entertainment scale I rate the Cirque shows that I have seen as the following:\n1. LOVE\n2. Zumanity\n3. O\n4. KA"
1,"We got free tickets tonight to see Barry Manilow through a seat filler web site. Neither of us are huge Manilow fan, but I was looking forward to the concert.\n\nIt didn't start out too great. \n\nI was thirsty so I bought a water which was $4 for a small 8 oz. bottle. Hardly a great deal but I can't complain too much as that was the sum total I paid for our night out at the concert.\n\nWhen the concert started my wife and I just kind of looked at each other and grinned/shook our heads. We weren't sure what we'd gotten ourselves into, but the first song or two were NOT good. I told my wife it would/should get better.\n\nFortunately it did. The songs got better and more familiar as the night progressed. As Christmas is approaching he also threw in several holiday songs.\n\nThe singing was interspersed with audio and video of his younger years. My favorite part was when he played a record his grandpa recorded of him when he was four. He had quite a voice back then. \n\nNow his voice is showing sings of his age and at times sounds more like he's talking than singing. His body is also showing signs of aging, as he gingerly moved about the stage.\n\nOverall, we had a good time. However, I don't think I'd pay to see the show."
2,Great food if you are intoxicated and brave enough to venture in after dark. The food here is greasy but satisfying. If you have heart disease or a short temper I advise you to stay away. The O's staff is generally unfriendly. The location is right below Pitt's towers where you hope a drunk girl doesn't vomit on you. I'm surprised the hours! After 2 a.m. and the students have all stumbled back in to their dorms is when the trouble starts with the city folks. Go with a friend and enjoy a Pitt Classic !
3,"Friend took me here, due to the fact that I just graduated college, and got a job, in my degree/field. so a free lunch is great either way. lol I want to comment on the ambiance first. Being that it was in summerlin, it was a little upscale. but it was a very a open setting. servers seem relaxed, for a busy saturday lunch. I always like to watch the servers, body language tells alot if they really like their job or not. made feel relaxed/welcoming throughout the whole dining experience. friend had the biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. had the power lunch combo. she loved the sandwich, and it came with soup which she didn't like, server gladly switched it for salad. who can mess up salad right?? salad was nothing special, mixed garden greens. I had the big eye tuna. a, with wasabi pea & ginger crust came with salad, a baby spinach, asian pears, sea beans, in a  creamy soy vinaigrette. Great flavor all around. don't eat too much seafood but tuna definitely made ma fan. would go back. only complaint, was soup obviously, and maybe 2 or 3 more slices of tuna. but everything as far as quality of food and service was great."
3,"Everyone knows that Bread and Butter is great.  So, I'm not going to rehash all the prior reviews.\n\nThe pastries are great.  My favorites are:\n\n1. Cheese Danish - more of a custard filling than the norm. Huge.\n2.  Sticky roll - Thickly coated with toasted pecans.  So, Good.\n3.  Macarons - Gigantic and cheap.\n\nIn fact, I'd say the only things I'd pass on are the muffins (way too gooey for my taste), PB & J brioche (kinda stale everytime I order it), and Challah.  \n\nThe best thing in my opinion are the employees.  They are so friendly, helpful and willing to give you a deal.  In fact, if you like their Facebook page, they'll occasionally advertise specials and freebies.  A recent one was a box of pastries with a discount to equal the temperature (It was 75F, so 75% off).  My inner bargain hunter loves that kind of crap!\n\nSo, get the pastries, like their FB page, and you're good to go.  The end."
1,"IHOP definitely fills the need for breakfast food in a jiffy. But to say that it's good breakfast food is a hit or miss. \n\nThis location is busy on Sunday mornings. I'm sure it's busy at all IHOPs on Sunday mornings, but it was especially cramped here. Not too bad of a wait - about 5 minutes. We were seated at a small two-seater booth an arm's length away from a table of eight. One of the members at this table was a screaming baby and his screaming kid older sister. The mum of the screaming tyrannical kids was completely ignorant while she chowed down on her food. Cue the migraine headache. \n\nCan't ding IHOP for the screaming kids. But I can ding them on their food and their service. My mom and I both ordered whole wheat pancakes with blueberries that came with scrambled egg white substitute and turkey bacon. She says that was decent. I ordered the Split Decision plate. Two buttermilk pancakes, 2 French toast triangles, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon and 2 sausages for about $10. Simple, right? Can't mess this up too much here. Except they did. My breakfast plate came with a tub of butter right on top of my pancakes and french toast (or should I say my butter came with a side of breakfast?). I tried scooping the butter off to the side of my plate, except it melted onto my eggs and my bacon. Mmm. Bacon and butter - the ultimate greasy delight...not. \n\nService was a joke. Our two-seater booth was very small. No biggie if there isn't anything else on our table. We didn't order coffee, but the coffee pot and the dish of creamer stayed on the table. I thought a server would be mindful enough to take that stuff away. Nope. It stayed until I flagged someone down to take those away so my mom and I could have some arm room to eat. \n\nI've been to this location a few times during late nights. Breakfast at 10 PM here is much better than breakfast at 10 AM. No questions asked."
3,"The Sandbar is always in our list of restaurants to visit when we are in Phoenix. The patio is great- the misters do the trick when the sun is hot. Prices are ok- not fantastic, but the thing that brings me back are the Baja Tacos. Awesome. We've gone as a couple and have also had family dinners there with the kids and have never been disappointed in the food. We're not partiers or dinkers, so that has never factored into the equation."
4,"I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.  The dcor is pretty rad too.  The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate..."
1,"Hmm... I must have gone here on an off day or something. My husband and I tried this place a few days after their grand opening. I was excited because no one had written a review yet. I've held off on writing a review because I didn't want to bash a brand new restaurant.\n\nWhen we walked in, the servers were very nice and polite. The interior is modern and simple. It looked like they had a lot of items on the menu but I was there for one thing... Pho.\n\nWe ordered some spring rolls to start. The presentation was artfully done. Unfortunately they weren't that flavorful.\n\nI ordered a bowl of pho and to my dismay, it was really bland. The broth pretty much makes or breaks the dish and it was a total fail to me. \n\nIt's been a while since I went so I'm hoping they have improved since their grand opening. The service is very good so that is a definite plus. I'll stick to the Vietnamese places on Spring Mountain."
0,"I've been to this establishment about 3 times in about the same amount of years, and boy is it GHETTO. I ordered a Ketel and soda the last time I was there and I'm pretty sure it was just rubbing alcohol with soda water. A couple of the girls I was with came back with some free shots, and they also tasted like disgustingness. I ended up spitting mine out and throwing it away. It was seriously the worst shot I had ever taken, hands down. It didn't even taste like liquor, more like some sort of cleaner. \n\nI give props to those solo dancers who are giving it all they've got on the dance floor. They're so brave. I feel like some of them are related to those awful American Idol singers who are tone deaf. They don't realize they're bad, and they are just embarrassing themselves and getting in others' ways. At least it's never packed, so it gives them plenty of room to do ninja-looking kicks and arm fans. There are also go-go dancers here, but they weren't too entertaining with the exception of one...out of the 4 or 5 who were there. She'll probably be going somewhere else soon.\n\nI always tell myself I won't return, but I've had to take it back a couple of times now. Maybe it'll be your lucky day if you ever show up, and we can spit our drinks out together!"
0,"So 45 days a bit steep for 'special' order sectional, but we dealt with it and it's fine.  I am disappointed in the delivery options and the lack of employee support in helping us find a date to work.  Maybe IKEA should have been our pick. We will share bad end of experience with friends and family unless they don't mind waiting over two months for furniture to arrive.  For now, we will continue to sit on our floor..."
3,"Love CDJ.  \n\nOld school Vegas in Mexican restaurant form.\n\nPretty diverse menu, good service, and good food.\n\nI stop in whenever I get a chance."
0,"Where \""Rock meets Country\"" says their website -- umm.. neither rock nor country ever showed up the night we were there - it was all techno and drunks on the dancefloor- ok - we can deal with that -- but we ended up having a truly horrible, rude waitress and terrible drinks to boot. \nwe didn't even finish our drinks - I took one sip of my house marg (served in a plastic soda glass) and decided it wasnt worth the 100's of calories of corn syrup..couldnt taste the tequila through the sweet mix so I don't know if it was any good or not.\nyech.\nwhat a dive. i think it was once a country bar - then they decided to reinvent themselves -- or tried to. no cowboys here -- or rockers either - just a bitchy waitress and bad drinks."
4,"The absolute best rotisserie chicken in Montreal. French fries are to die for. Coleslaw is amazing. Leg, breast, wings - all so juicy and flavorful. Don't forget the Hot Chicken sandwich, either. A Montreal landmark."
0,"Its location right near UNLV suggests that it's mainly targeting the hungry college crowds. I, myself, graduated a long~ ago and graduated from \""college food.\"" It's just type of food to fill u up, not much more. Especially when it's combined with employees who cares less about any quality service than just clock-in, clock-out to earn a check, it's definitely a place I wouldn't recommend. Food was slightly better than a Frozen-Dinner, with lack of taste and quality. Service was terrible and rude!"
2,"After reading many reviews for places to eat in Tempe, I decided I wanted a burger. Chose Five Guys because of a friend of a friend  raving over it. \n\nWalked in and read the 30 signs they had all around the place then finally made my way to order. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion, lettuce, and mustard. My partner ordered a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, ketchup,and mustard. We each had a drink and shared a small Cajun fry.\nWe asked the cashier how big each patty was and he said 3.3 to 3.5oz's. \nFood was quick. Fries were small but plentiful, actually, we only ate the the extras at the bottom of the bag. The cup was still full. Anyways I started on my burger and found it to be okay. It was good but that's it. The burger was juicy but not flavorful, I am glad that I added the cheese which made it a little better. I really didn't like the seasoned fries, they were better when I dipped them in hot sauce.\nMy partners burger was of course messy but the bacon was good, crunchy and had a smokey flavor. It was good, definitely better than mine but nothing I would crave. Overall, I wasn't blown especially being on Mill, closing at 7 and being overpriced."
4,"Big fan of this friendly bar. Every time we stop in we usually sit in the bar area or at the bar. The staff is very attentive and fun, and we've met some pretty nice regulars. We've tried a lot of the menu and definitely love the Buffalo chips, and the blackened ahi tuna wrap, and the pulled pork on a pretzal roll..wow. Always a good time! Bar servers are the best!"
3,Great place to watch a game. The food is good and the beer prices make my husband happy. We like to share the two for $20 meal deal!
3,"Take your time to browse and be open to new possibilties.  I purchased many used books at this shop, and plenty of sheet music, all for killer deals.  It's always a required stop on my downtown Urbana excursions.  Many used stores don't survive with high rents and chain competition, so please patronize your local used bookstore."
4,"Just moved to town and I needed a new table and some barstools.  I was really having a hard time finding a furniture store for such a large city. Plus I prefer good quality, durable, and elegant furniture, so IKEA is not the place for me.  I finally found this store and was very impressed with their inventory.  I found exactly what I needed right away.  And they are willing to work with you on price.  Very courteous salespeople, they don't pressure you, so it makes you want to actually buy furniture from them.  Said it would take 3 weeks to get our stuff, we had it in a couple days.  Delivery was reasonable and they were also very pleasant while delivering.  Hope this will cover me for a while, but if I do need something, this will be my go-to.  Thanks!"
2,"I have ordered twice from this restaurant through the grubhub delivery service. Their burguers are ok, they are kind of bland for my taste and The texture it's kind of grainy, whenever you chew on them you will find like little balls of fat or something like that. To be honest, I have tried better burguers. Their chips are nice since they keep crunchy for a long time. The only thing I like from there it's the southwestern chk sandwich, it has Cajun spices and the spicy ranch it's good. My boyfriend ordered the AA breakfast sandwich and he did not get the bacon it is supposed to have, I don't like it when they do that at the restaurants, they should try to be more careful in taking a good care of their customers."
4,"5/14/2014\nFrank Coleman\nThe people at Wilhelm are very pleasant to deal with, and they do a wonderful job. I have been going to Wilhelm for many years and I don't plan on going anywhere else anytime soon!!!!"
3,"As for the hotel, this is probably one of the most modern hotels on the strip if not the most. which is why i like it so much. It goes with people in my demographic which is Gen X and Y. But hey it has a nice gaming floor and nice pit bosses. Interesting note... This is owned by Deutsche Bank. lol anyways I also wanted to say that i've never actually stayed in here but i plan on to in the near future. The food could be better really nothing to note there but yeah, it gets the job done... (food wise)"
0,"Poor customer service everytime. The first time I went through the drive through they gave my order to someone else (after waiting 15 minutes in the drive through) which created two unhappy customers, then wanted me to wait for an additional 10 minutes while they made the correct order. The second time my order was ready and the girl at the window was too busy talking to co-workers to notice. Good food, but go to another location."
4,"I've lived near & been eating at Tessios for 9 years(previously TC Luigis). Besides a few more hikes in price than I would like, the prices are still great for what you get. I love the pizza & it's the best thing I've found in the valley to compare to NY pizza I grew up & lived on. The wings are great too(although a few lil ones have been sneakin in) & the sandwiches are very decent too. I never mind waiting for their delivery cause they're usually faster than they say & it's worth it either way. The guys aren't overly plesant or anything, but this is take out & if you've ever had real New York pizza in New York, you know this is the real deal. I love just about everybody that works there even though we don't exchange more than a word or two & as long as they keep servin me awesome pizza, I'll keep coming back. Keep up the good work guys! If you like NY style, try this & you won't regret it. (Right next to Tops, so grab a few beers while you're at it)"
1,"I have heard many things about Korean Fried Chicken... \""life changing\"", \""orgasmic\"", \""so good it will make you drop kick your mother, twice\""...and \""jolly good!\""\n\nThat being said, I was not the least bit recalcitrant to visit this new entrant into the Pittsburgh food scene, when it was brought to my attention by Maren V. Venturing back into the proverbial \""old stomping grounds\"" of the University of Pittsburgh, and navigating the myriad of Sperry wearing, sweatpants clad undergrads, we entered the small and crowded establishment. Following a not so brief wait, we placed an order for soy garlic wings. We were informed, there were no drumsticks available. Tears. The order was delivered in a respectably prompt fashion. As a bonus, they had finger condoms ( is there a better name for these things?) if you are a Monk-esque having two hands dirty at the same time-a phobe, like myself. \n\nLets get to the wings, shall we? The first bites for a KFC virgin such as myself were confusing to say the least. I had heard these were to be double fried, and crispy, yet tender. I detected no difference to regular chicken wings to be honest. The sauce was almost sickeningly sweet, yet lacking in any subtle distinction of flavor. Some were crispy, some were almost soggy. \n\nIn all honesty, I threw about 8 away. I never throw food away. I generally eat everyone elses leftovers because I am fat as f***. \n\nI might chalk it up to being extremely busy, but I really dont have desires to give a second chance. I must find KFC elsewhere."
3,"The three most important things in real estate? Location, location, location.\n\nIt's the same when choosing a hotel, whether for business or pleasure. It's no surprise then, that situated in a part of Charlotte called \""The EpiCentre\"", that aLoft is truly in a phenomenal location.\n\nThere are no shortage of restaurants to eat at and diversions to be had near aLoft.\n\n* Jason's Deli -- the healthiest restaurant I have found in Charlotte, with the possible exception of Pita Pit.\n* Firehouse Subs -- Subs bigger than your head.\n* Mez -- Great lounge and upscale restaurant\n* Enso -- Sushi and Bar\n* Blackfinn -- American Bar and Burger Joint\n* Strikecity -- Pizza and Bowling\n* Mortimer's -- American Pub\n\n* Whiskey River -- THE place to be on Tuesday Nights if you're in your 20s.\n* Suite -- THE place to be on Wednesday Nights if you're in your 20s.\n* Howl at the Moon -- Great dueling piano bar that is always bumping on Thursdays Nights.\n* Kazba -- Great upscale bar with live music on most Thursdays and Fridays.\n\nAnd after you're done shmoozing and boozing, aLoft is less than a block away.\n\nAs for the interior of the place, it's great. The front desk area boasts a communal pool table to hang out and play on. There's a lounge area which opens up to the wxyz bar, The BEST Hotel Bar in Charlotte. There's a swimming pool, a laundry room on every floor, and a hotel gym: complete with full rack of weights, benches, ab balls and cardio machines.\n\nRooms are spacious, and all have plasma TVs installed on the walls, mini fridge, and safe, with free Internet for all hotel guests (Which is more than can be said about their Sister Hotel a few blocks away, the Westin, which asks for $14.99 for a day of Internet Access. Pfft, it's 2010, people: get your heads out of your butts -- wifi should be free.)\n\nStaff are extremely friendly and accomadating, and the price simply can't be beat.\n\nJust a few minor knitpicks --\n* No Ice machines on every floor -- you have to head to the front desk to pick up Ice.\n* The only way to get to the hotel is via elevator, which are notoriously slow. On those horrid days when one of the elevators are busted, expect as long as a 2-3 minute wait before you can take the elevator up to aLoft.\n\nAll in all, I love aLoft. It's a solid hotel, with friendly staff, great gym facilities, and the location and price point are perfect. I would highly recommend aLoft to anyone visiting Charlotte."
3,"Very fresh and well made Asian cuisine. I went with a classic Chinese dish, beef with broccoli and the broccoli was steamed well and was firm, not mush. The beef was tender and perfectly cooked.  Plus it wasn't swimming in sauce.  \n\nWe hit it up during a very late lunch and there was only us and another table, so service was great.  Really nice setting. \n\nIt was a good experience, I would recommend."
4,"I called today when I was in a frenzy because my car was acting up, and I was not in my neck of the woods.  \n\nI received a caring voice on the other end.  Unfortunately, he was not able to service my car because they were booked solid, but he gave me suggestions and recommended another establishment.  \n\nI truly think this must be a good place that cares about its customers.\n\nThank you!"
3,"Went to this restaurant for a weekend dinner. Finger licking mediterranean food :) I ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, baba ganoush and falafel along with yellow peas soup. Pita was soft and freshly made. Everything tasted awesome. The service was quick and good. \nOnly thing I didn't like was the flavored water. I think it's some authentic thing but personally didn't like it and no one gave the alternative of plain water. Other than that very good place. Will go again !!"
3,"We wanted to keep it classy, and The Chandelier is supposed to be one of the best/most popular lounges. I loved the giant crystal chandelier. It's a perfect place for some photo ops. There are 3 levels, and I found that each level has a different drink menu. Their drinks are not what you typically find everywhere. \n\nI ordered the Bruce Tea (Kai Coconut Pandan Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Matcha Tea Powder, Peanut Butter, Lemongrass infused Coconut Cream, Birdseed Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves). I'm game to try anything with matcha. The drink was very unique. It was creamy and there were pieces of peanut in it. I'm not sure I liked the drink all that much, but I don't regret trying it."
0,Crap food and just for looks ..  they serve angel hair fried pasta on your plate I thought it was twigs from outside ... I ordered a hamburger and the waitress is supposed to say what would you like on it and that's it but .. She wanted to have a cry face and asked me you want cheese want this you want that and a big attitude like a dick in her ass. The hamburger had no flavor all the food had no flavor they don't know what salt black pepper and garlic powder is ? cuz they want to save f****** money the chicken fried Benedict that was on TV man vs food and it was so small it was enough to feed a little baby here's some advice if you guys serve bad tasting food at least learn your waitresses how to act nice and maybe people will have a good time  learn your waitress  not to order food for people just ask what the customer wants and shut your f****** mouth don't waste your money  they serve big  bread make the food look big but they don't put meat in the corn beef they don't put big meets
1,"Ok, so I've only been there when I'm hammered.  So sue me.  \n\nWhen I have gone to Joe's, it is VERY late night as the various clubs near Shoeman/Scottsdale begin to wind down, and this place has a huge line out the door every time.  The pizza, which is sold by the HUGE slice, is simply acceptable - not special, not delectable, not even excellent.....just acceptable.  For me, pizza starts with a great cheese, and the cheese here just seems so....bashas-like and ordinary, without that quality mouthfeel you get from cheese at places like Street of New York.    \n\nOf course, when you're binging after six drinks, \""acceptable\"" has a funny way of becoming \""I must have it right now.\""  So I'm sure I'll go there in the future, but my expectations will be well calibrated -- This is drinking food, placed smack dab in a location that caters directly to people that have been drinking.\n\nBuzzed or not, that long line can sure be annoying....."
3,"We had a business lunch there yesterday and it was packed with the Arts festival going on. The City of Scottsdale is having an arts festival this weekend and it is very cool! We went after and there were two stages, lots of booths and even a kids area!\n\nBack to AZ88, I guess the reason you are reading this! \nThere was a line to get in (although we took patio seating outside and got to sit right away). The couple in front of us had a little marital \""tiff\"" as the wife didn't want to sit outside. The temps were in the 70's and this couple was from Wisconsin, but hey their loss was our gain! \n\nAs usual the food was excellent! I had the club sandwich with bacon and chicken.  The waffle fries (my favorite by the way) were a little skimpy but I made it work, with the huge sandwich that was served!\n\nHowever on this visit, the service was not that great. One person in my party (there were three of us) asked for extra dressing with her salad, when she needed it (about 15 minutes into the meal) she finally just got up and went to ask for it. Same when we wanted the check, our waitress was nowhere to be found. Took forever to get our check and then when she never came to get our payment we just went inside.\n\nThat being said, when there is not an event happening, this place has good service, funky bathrooms (and I mean FUNKY) and free wireless! When I want a quiet \""working\"" lunch this is the place I like to go."
1,The men were talented but they were super obnoxious when it comes to getting tips.\nThey hustled every body and were rude if you didn't tip enough. \nWe were there to have a good time but when the men weren't singing they were practically begging for tips.\nI would have tipped maybe $5 but I was afraid of getting heckled for not tipping enough.
4,"This was hands down the best Indian food I have had to date. I had sort of given up on Indian food with most of the restaurants in the Seattle area going to a lunch buffet which is just luke warm gross food like every other buffet I have tried. \n\nI didn't want to spend a lot of money and most of their food is $10 and above so I got the $7 Tandoori Chicken wrap. Sweet mother of Ganesha this was amazing! Tandoori Chicken, vegetables and spices in a very hot very fresh Naan wrap. \n\nThe service was polite and prompt. The place seems to be mostly frequented by the local Indian populations (we were the only non-Indian people in there). \n\nBeing a family restaurant, expect to have kids all around you, being kids.   \n\nOn a side note and I am not sure if this adds or subtracts from the over all authenticity of the experience but the smell coming out of my ass today is like a Mumbai slum! (so I hear) Woooooo Weeeeee........"
1,"This place was recommended to us by various friends.  We were a party of 9, we were seated on the back of the restaurant. Food is good but not great.  Service is cr...  Rude in general, slow and the didn't check frequently enough if we needed something. \n\nFor a restaurant with those prices I would expect a lot more."
3,"We had not been to a Hooters since moving here from South Carolina and I just couldn't help it any longer. I love Hooters wings and so my family and I gave the Hooters in Spring Valley a try. It was definitely worth it. The food was great and the wings were even better than I remember. The service was good, but not great. But, overall it was a good experience. 4 out of 5 stars"
0,The only SANE reason I would pay $5 for an iced tea is for the discounted refills. Apparently they don't do that here. I freakin hate the inconsistencies between Starbucks locations! I'm learning to stick to the few good locations around Las Vegas & ignore the rest.
3,"This Harris Teeter is tiny and not the best as far as prices and selection, but they have by far the best deli of any of the Harris Teeters I've been to in the area.  I'd eat a Harris Teeter sub over Subway any day of the week, and especially from this location.  Instead of squirting mayo and mustard from a bottle, one on each side, they lather it on with a knife, creating this unbelievably magical sauce that I would eat on their fresh white bread alone.  Add to it great cuts of meat and fresh veggies, and you have sandwich perfection.  However, don't come here if you're looking for a deal because its one of the more overpriced Teet's I've visited. (Which is why it lost one crucial star from me.)   But if you're in uptown and craving a good sub, this is the place to go!  Not to mention it's in fourth ward, one of the most beautiful areas of Charlotte."
0,Don't eat or drink here. Rooms okay but noisy. Parking scary. Bar and restaurant prices and service ridiculous. Wander to find better anywhere but here. Embarassed to think this represents Arizona for visitors.
3,"I met a friend, a Vegas local, at Nora's per her suggestion. It's very close to the Gold Coast where I usually stay (I'm a bingo addict) and away from all the Strip madness. The atmosphere is still great even if the neighborhood isn't all that nice. \n\nThe food is pretty good. Not the most fantastic stuff I've ever had, but I've enjoyed every dish I've had there. It's definitely better than Fiamma in MGM and about half the price. Vodka penne has been my favorite so far. \n\nWhat really stands out are the cocktails. They have some interesting house cocktails on the menu that were really delicious. I have a decent knowledge of liquors thanks to my cocktail-enthusiast husband, but Nora's had a few things I've never heard of that were fun to try. I loved their Pimm's Cup --so refreshing during summer in the desert.\n\nI just realized I've never had dessert here. Gotta go back on my next visit!"
1,Service was horrible! !  Order 24 wings and didn't receive on drumlet.  My 7 year old sons burger was pink inside.  When I told the waitress it was raw she got smart.  Then the General Manager came by to apologize.  But he was disinterested in my complaint. So why even come over and waste my time.  Then I asked who the owner was and the same manager came back and said he was the owner.  I don't have time for all the games.
2,I have never been here before. I loved the simple charm of this place and it's a pure Hot Dog enthusiasts heaven. \n\nIt's the perfect place to take a break and go get a very good Hot Dog. \n\nI had the Maxwell Polish dog. Absolutely delicious! The only reason this place gets a 3 instead of a 5 for me is the portion size of the dog vs. the price. No way that dog is worth almost $5. The $1 Polish dogs at Costco are twice the size and almost as tasty. \n\nBring that price down to at least just under $3 and I would prefer this dog to anything else. Unless you decide to offer slightly better seating and friendlier service. That I don't mind paying extra for.
0,"Me and my lady went here new year's day because there were not too many places open.  We got seated right away, but then waited 20 minutes until someone aknowledged us.  Couldn't even flag anyone down because they stuck us in the corner.  This was same for 2 other couples that got seated near us.\n\nFinally ordered drinks and food...30 minutes later food came; it was not appealing at all and way overpriced.  Burger was gray all the way through and hard.  salad was drenched with dressing.  Everyone sitting in our vacinity were aggravated and some got up and left.\n\nI asked for the bill; it took another 15 minutes to get that.  Then I waited for the waitress to come back to make change so that I didn't have to leave her a tip.\n\nHere's a tip for anyone considering going to Boccacino's... Don't bother.\n\nIf I can stop one person from eating here, then this review was a success!"
3,"I loved the more casual atmosphere at this location and the fact that it's tucked into the Cosmo so you don't have a huge crowd coming in off the strip. The 'air margaritas' were strong and tasty. They may look small, but they're powerful. It was hard to choose from the menu because so much sounded wonderful. Ended up with chips and salsa, the habonaro salsa (major heat), chicken flautas, and a lunch special that was pretty much equivalent to a ham quesadilla. All so tasty! I didn't think we'd have time for dessert, but the sticky rice sans rice was calling to me.. Awesome way to end a meal- light, sweet, full of flavor. The fresh mango adds just enough sweetness to the dish. I could have eaten here everyday!"
2,"One of the lucky ones! I happened to be strolling through the recently opened Linq and discovered that the view High Roller was about to open for business, so they were giving free preview rides.  I was also lucky to happen by about 15 after they started giving away rides so I only had to wait 30 min to get on. \n\nOver all, it's a fantastic view, especially at night and if you've not been to Vegas much you get to see a lot. However, about 1/2 of the view is obstructed by the hotels closest to the ride. The other 1/2 is rather nice, but you can really only see the parts of the strip where there are low rise buildings. (I actually had a better view of the strip as I landed on my airplane) \n\nIt is a fantastic opportunity and pretty cool to be that high up.  It's a pleasant 30 min ride with plenty of room to move about the cabin despite 35 people inside. I was waiting to see what pricing they put on it before I made a final conclusion. $25 before 6pm, $35 after 6pm (both with advance ticket purchase) and $60 to buy and ride immediately. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think it's anywhere near worth that price. Especially when you start multiplying it by multiple family members.  Will be interested to see how busy it is on a summer day...likely lots of people willing to pay that. \n\n5 stars for it being the highest in the world \n4 stars for the view \n3 stars for the experience (got bored about 20 min in)\n2 stars for the price\n3 stars overall"
3,"I carried out the rib tickler. The ribs were not quite fall of the bone but the sauce was tasty. I wish there was a bit more of it on the ribs or a little side of it since it was take out. The fries were fries. You can't go wrong with a deep fried potato and a little salt. The baked beans were good and had a nice flavor. They were not too overpowering on the pepper which can be hard to achieve, for some reason, for a lot of barbecue places. \n\nMy coworker had the pork BBQ sandwich. She agreed with me that the pork was a little chewy but the flavor was very good. We joked around that early guy must have been about 45 minutes late this morning. Since everyone else said how tender the meat was when they had it. \n\nThe total winner on the meal was the \""sugar biscuits\"". Those little puppies earned Sauceman's an extra star from me. They are basically homemade little donut puffs rolled in sugar. Holy Shnikies! I had two of these little puffy dreams and could have easily eaten a dozen more. \nOne of them I ate piping hot and the other was luke warm. To my surprise, the luke warm one was still as good as the first. Fried perfection."
3,"I had never been to Drai's before because I am a normal person who likes to sleep. However, I went with co-workers this past Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting much from a spot at Bally's of all places but this was pretty cool. Doors didn't open till around 2:30am but the party really didn't get going till about 4:30am. It died out fairly quickly however but that may have been account of it being Sunday going into Monday. Part of me wonders if they should just be a Friday-Saturday spot for afterhours. Anyway, the decor and layout is pretty cool. It's a small venue but seeing as it's \""temporary\"" that wasn't surprising. I may have to make more of an effort to go to Afterhours again when they move into the new (original) location across the street at the un-named Caesars property."
3,One of my favorite places to eat good food good service great sushi. Try the Momo box it's wonderful
2,"Good food, great service, and great drinks.  This is a nice change of pace from the usual Yard House stop in Town Square.  I'd come back again."
2,"I stopped in last week because I had a hankering for Indian and Allo Inde was just a block up from my hotel.  I guess I was a bit late for the lunch crowd because the dining room was empty, except for a couple of people near the window finishing their meals.  \n\nThe bartender looked up and motioned me toward what was obviously not one of the choicer tables and instead of a nice, sunny view of Rue Stanley, I was treated to a corner on the dark side of the bar with a view of a high chair and a rack of tourist brochures.  Big deal?  Well, I was hungry and I wasn't that picky so I guess I won't hold it against them.\n\nAs I made myself comfortable, it became clear that the staff were setting up for dinner and I was a bit sad that I didn't get a flickering votive at my table. (So long as it's not burning down my house, I love fire.)  The waiter made it all better, however, when along with the menu, he left the list of $9.99 lunch specials.  I didn't look past the first item, chicken curry, and I placed my order, along with a can of Coca Cola and naan.\n\nA few moments later, the waiter brought me a bowl of lentil soup and just as I finished that, out came my naan and chicken curry, a small salad and a vegetable dish with cauliflower that I couldn't quite identify.  It wasn't the best Indian meal I'd ever eaten but for fifteen dollars including the tip, I got a tasty lunch and more food than I could eat.  I would definitely return although next time, I'd ask for a better table."
4,"5 star rating because of our waitress Amy. In all honesty probably the best server ive ever had, anywhere. Great service, great personality. She seemed to really enjoy interacting with our 8 month old the whole time we were there. To top it off she got us a complimentary dessert for my mom's 50th birthday and our wedding that day. Just an overall awesome experience, food was pretty good too."
4,"Came with a group of 6ish while at convention, we shared numerous plates and all left satisfied and happy for around $100 total which is fantastic in Vegas and for being right behind the strip. Ambiance was warm and intimate. There is a bit of a wait, seems to be a popular place, however, a bar is conveniently located a couple doors down which we took advantage of while waiting.  Raved about the place to fellow conference attendees encouraging them to check it out. We had too many dishes to recall, however, we were not disappointed with any of them. Will make it back next time in town."
1,"My experience here was ok. I am new to town and wanted to get my nails done on a holiday, fortunately they were open. However, like most nails shops like this they were trying to do too much at once. The gentleman who did my nails had no conversation for me, not sure if it was because he was so busy watching what everyone else was doing or because he was tending to his, approximately, 10 year old son. Either way I'm still on the hunt for a regular salon and would probably only go here in an emergency."
1,"My sister and I went in there about a week ago and we were not satisfied, the moment we walked in they all just started talking in their language and we felt very uncomfortable. I hate going into a salon and all they talk is Vietnamese its so rude and unprofessional, we felt that they were talking about us the whole time. They didn't paint the gel on right either it looked horrible, all in the creases and on the cuticle, I'm very picky with that and I wouldn't recommend this salon to anybody."
3,"Really good food. Hearty flavors that span Asian to Southern. My kids love the barbecue sandwiches. My wife loves their Thai Beef Salad. With new place, a little inconsistency is normal as tweeking occurs, however the value is good for the quality of food. I'd go here over 15 North anytime for a meal.  Service depends on who you get - ask for your favorite server if possible (once you find him/her).  Good service should be rewarded and acknowledged."
4,"Ok, so I went during Christmas. Weird time for Vegas I know BUT with that being said, the town was like half full so there were plenty of opportunities to loose your money faster than in the regular season...\n\nSO I had no idea about the Palms Place hotel. I thought it was the Palms but found out this is the older building. We walked in, it was nice, they had the music pumpin and the people seemed pretty cool. Went to the room...I was underwhelmed to say the least.  So I laid out the plan and tried to get an upgrade.   Upgrade successful...$30, on the 53rd floor with a full service hotel room/suite...tub in the bedroom, full kitchen, fire place and the most amazing view of Las Vegas. I was very happy with the room, the flexibility of the staff and everything was flawless. I'd stay here again just because of the staff. Everyone was very nice"
1,"It sucks to do this first to review and 2 stars :(  So I was out at a friends house and was looking for something close by this came up on my app.  So I come in and am greated nicely by the waitress that is the reason they got the 2 stars instead of 1 she takes my order and leaves me alone. \n\nNow I am getting my food to go but I know and she knows I have about a 20 minute wait, would have been nice to have been offered a glass of water over sight on her part.  Sadly this was in the top 5 worst sandwiches I have ever had.  It was so greasy it was dripping off the sandwich.  I got the Ruben the meat layer was thin the sauerkraut was thick and way over powered the thin meat layer.  The fries were so burnt I thought at first they were sweet potato fries they weren't.  The odd thing was they were undercooked and raw in the middle, how does that happen?  They were also dripping in grease literally dripping.\n\nUgh, I would not come back even if I was at the bar next door."
0,"Who knew a place that can be so popular can be so disgusting.  I didn't know a beef bowl with vegetables could be made so bad.  The veggies were slimy because they were covered in some glop along with some thing disgusting beef that just smelled.  I've tried it in California also, and it tastes the same here.  I just don't get how it's so popular."
1,"I try really hard not to give a negative review but I just have to this time around. I'm at a 5a7 and ordered the angus burger. It was a brick and dry, I couldn't even take a bite. They offered to change it, I refused because it was awful. Never again will I eat here."
3,"Ahh, one of my favorite stores. \n\nThe Jungle Zone is the token head shop in the Vegas area. Just about any and everything ~counterculture~ related can be found here. From smoking paraphernalia to a neverending selection of incense. From Hawaiian jewelry to North African home decor. Oh, and there's also a tattoo and piercing studio on site. A little over a year ago I got my left cartilage pierced here. It came at a cost of $30 and was executed quickly in a clean and sanitary facility. If I ever get any more piercings, this will definitely be the place. In addition to the fact that it's one of the two shops that I'm considering for getting my first tattoo. \n\nIt's always funny how, no matter how many times I walk in, the decor manages to freak me out a little bit every time. But once you get past the skeletal statues, the plastic bats hanging from the ceiling and the multiple displays of fossilized bug jewelry, one is welcomed to a cavalcade of oddities that reeks of years of burning incense. I have quite a few items of handcrafted neckalces and bracelets as well as crazy t-shirts from this place. And I could spend days browsing through their selection of incense, candles and other \""alternative\"" air fresheners. \n\nIt can be a tad pricey, and I will say that there tends to be a high employment turnover, which leads to dealing with assholes or wackjobs behind the counter every now and then, but the thing about those assholes and wackjobs is I never seem to encounter them on more than one visit. Usually the people who work in here are pretty damn cool! \n\nThe Final Verdict\n\nPros:\nThe only real head shop in Vegas\nMost of the people who work here are awesome\nGood and reasonably priced body mod services\nIt sells pretty much...everything lol\n\nCons:\nCan get pricey\nThe here today-gone tomorrow jerkies that can be encountered working here on occasion\n\nHuh?:\nOkay, who the hell is buying fossilized bug jewelry and keychains?\n\nReturn factor: 10/10. I just moved into a new place and need to do some decorating anyway."
3,"We enjoyed our time at the Orange Sky on Thursday 10/16/14.  The staff starting with the young woman at the elevator to the person who cleared our plates were very friendly and professional.  The view was beautiful.  I noticed that some of the arm chairs were a little overly worn out.  I think they should get some love and attention.  Our server was Teresa and she was great.  I thought the salmon could have been grilled slightly longer but I am not a connoisseur nor a chef but the presentation was lovely.  My side was a little disappointing because there was a flavor in the red potato dish that overwhelmed.  I am picky but my friend whose birthday it was completely enjoyed the generous serving of perfectly cooked calamari, the shrimp dish and his side of gnocchi.  They brought him a delightful and beautifully presented chocolate mousse crunch for his birthday.  I want the dessert chef's writing ability in chocolate!  It was wonderful experience and I would venture there again during the week."
2,"Drumroll please............I have now completed my journey of seeing every cirque show in Vegas.  There were some good things about his show, but  definitely not my favorite.  There was a lot of singing. Alot.  That's great, but I felt like there should have been something else going on too.  Highlights were the trampoline set and the two guys hanging and swinging from the large guitar.  (This is the extent of the acrobatics in the whole show)  I did enjoy the music and the show was okay, I just think they could do so much, much more to make it great."
4,"I have been coming here for about 3 years now.  It was one of the best finds of all time.  Haseem & Ameara (sp) are the best at making you feel at home and the food is beyond excellent.  I get the grilled chicken with a greek salad and their french fries.  Holy cow, what a treat.  Although this is a tiny little place, it is all heart.  Love you guys."
2,"I like the kind of music the play here (Hip-hop with a little house), however, the crowd and location are a little annoying. However, there is almost never a line, so if you couldn't get into light then come here."
1,"What a disappointment.  The hotel and rooms is dated but pretty clean.   I'm sure it was great in its day, but there was worn carpet, mystery stains, the bathroom mirror frame was delaminating, the mattress creaked, wall paper was torn, and the wardrobe had veneer peeling off of it.   Right outside our room there was a hole kicked in the wall.  On the main floor where its designed to be Paris streets, everything is dingy and depressing, the novelty wears off as you walk for probably a half mile to the parking garage or monorail.  The front desk is surrounded by casino, so you have to walk through the smokey slot area to check in and then get to your room.\n\nThe cable tv has about 5 basic cable channels we would all expect, and the rest are weird international channels in other languages.  Wifi is $15 per day and dropped the connection consistently."
1,Thr food is great and the host was good.  However I was asking for a burger to be made as advertised and as in past has been. The runner johnny made me feel horrible when he out loud told the chefs not to listen to my request for a medium done burger... if you have a certain temp for your burgers it needs to be posted and or politely tell the patron sorry we have a standard of cooking temp.  Do not tell the chefs not to do something that the guest asks of them. All I wanted was an apology. Never going back for the rude runner( possibly manager). I am a concierge and I have recomended this location in the past. Not anymore. Needs a lesson in customer satisfaction....
3,"In Madison for a conference, I was enticing into Graze for lunch by the modern glass building and the appealing menu.   Their food is all locally sourced, and the building is pretty cool on the inside--all glass walls. They also have an outdoor patio. I tried the blueberry homemade lemonade ($3) and the Italian beef and cheese sandwich ($11) with cheese curds (add $2). Everything was fantastic and tasted really fresh. Service was awesome too. The only complaint is that for $11, the Italian beef and cheese was pretty small (about half of what I was expecting). However, the cheese curds were wonderful. \n\nPros: locally sourced, fresh food, great cheese curds\nCons: sandwich was a little small"
4,"My son who is 8 has a fine palate and while he enjoys kid food like any other kid, he believe it or not, really appreciates a fine dining experience. \nSo when I received a $50 gift certificate to Capital Grille (thanks to Yelp!) I decided to take him there to celebrate the last days of summer and first day of school. \nThe truth is, you don't see too many kids at the Capital Grille especially during the lunch hour.  Mainly, you see the business crowd so I was a little concerned with how Andrew would be received. \nMy worries were for naught. Our waiter, Jose, was fantastic. He had small children of his own and he treated Andrew with such brilliance that as a parent, I was impressed and grateful. He answered every question Andrew had with patience from how is the burger cooked to if extra lemonade is free. He also showed Andrew how to use the scraper to clean off the table. It was so enjoyable we were there for over an hour and a half and Jose never made us feel as though he was wishing the table to be free for the next customers. \nI could go on and on about how great Jose is and what a wonderful dining experience we had . . . . I should talk about the food too.\nWe both ordered from their summer pre fixe menu- I had the watermelon and arugula salad and the scallop over risotto. Andrew had their angus burger with fries. Both were large portioned and plenty filling.  And absolutely delicious. Both of us loved our entrees!\nDuring the lunch, the manager even came by and said hello to BOTH Andrew and I. \nAndrew being 8, could have been totally brushed off by the manager and the waiter- Capital Grille showed itself for the fine establishment that its reputation stands for and treated Andrew with such enthusiasm and respect that I was very appreciative for such a fine dining experience for both of us!"
3,"I hadn't been to Fresh and Easy since they remodeled it so I was taken back quite a bit when I stepped inside. They changed the entire layout of the store so it took me a little while to get the items I needed. I'm looking to forward to trying out their smoothies, maybe next time. They still have the self checkout lanes but now they have added one cashier  to the mix. \n\nPrices have gone up from when they first opened a few years back. I still remember when you could buy their gallon of pink lemonade for only $1. I didn't notice a price difference due to the re-opening. I was still able to buy my pasta for $1. Produce has always been a bit on the pricey side here so I don't really buy it, only the organic bananas. I mostly come here to buy my sons snacks and organic juice for school. No price difference there. The clearance items are still great deals, they had lettuce on clearance for $0.75 and hummus for under $2, I love their hummus! \n\nYou can find gluten free pastries here and a few imported items. They have a good selection on organic items, from cereals to produce, but note that they don't have a big selection for produce, way smaller than your average grocery store. Their ground beef is free of pink slime which is a huge plus! \n\nF&E is really convenient because it is open 24 hours, I just wish they were closer! I'm still patiently waiting for the location on Sunset and Fort Apache to open up, until it does, this location is the nearest to me."
0,"Dishonest pathological liar.  I have witnessed this, the owner Young Yi takes your money and does nothing.  Unprofessional, disorganized and excuse ridden.  I have heard this guy will blame anything and everyone while not following legal or ethic business practices.  He will delay projects forever and he will point fault at everyone but himself.  How do you look your family in the eye when you lie to everyone?\n\nScary to hear that he doesn't have Workman's Comp Insurance for his employees, avoids payroll taxes and pulls cash out of his employees' paychecks, I meant \""independent contractor's\""  paychecks for \""taxes\"".  Wonder how many people he is paying under the table?  Word on the street if you want fraudulent garbage to build your project then end up in financial ruin with not even a business to run then by all means hire MJ Construction in Las Vegas to build your business.  I think they are licensed in other states so spread the wealth."
4,These guys just keep getting better!  Just got a check for a referral in the mail!  WOW nobody does this!  What a great surprise!  My friend Cheryl bought a MINI just like mine and I got a check for sending her!  AWESOME!!  Thanks for keeping your word Stephen!  Cant wait to refer some other peeps!\n\nKeep up the great work!!!
0,"Unfortunately I did not have the same experience as many that have rated this restaurant a 4 star or better. I ate there recently with my wife and son. Neither of us enjoyed our food. Poor food quality and overpriced. My wife ordered the steak salad. The meat was fatty and chewy. Even the pretzel appetizer was horrible. It was not very soft and lacked good flavor. My son, who lives for chicken spit it out and ate fries for dinner. Will not be returning. We wished we had walked ten more feet to True Foods! Their food is fabulous by the way."
1,"A friend of mine plays there on Mondays...so we wanted to surprise him and go watch him play.  So I called about 3pm to find out what time he goes on.  Here's how the conversation went:\n\nMe: **ring ring**\nRula: This is Steve\nMe: Hello is the Rula Bula\nRula: Yeah\nMe:  I was just wondering what time Shelby goes on tonight?\nRula: I don't even know.  Probably 9, 9:30, 10\nMe: Can you get me someone who can find out?\nRula: No, there are no managers here. (He hung up at this point)\n\nI don't know about you, but that was not customer service at all.   So I waited an hour, called again.  This time got a girl.  I knew she would be better then the last guy cause she answered the phone...\""Thank you for calling Rula Bula.  How can I help you.\""  Much better then, \""This is steve\"". \n\nShe told me exactly what time Shelby went on and let me know that they serve food til 10p.\n\nSo we got there about 8:30p.  Ordered drinks and food.  Was enjoying ourselves until the server came over and told us she was going to have to close our tab because she was leaving.  That is one of my biggest pet peeves, when I am forced to close my tab cause that person wants to go home.  Why can't my tab just be transfered to someone else?  \n\nSo we're enjoying music and the bartender comes to clear our glasses and my friend ask her if he could have another stella.  She doesn't say anything and just walks away.  15 mins later we're looking for her to find out about the stella, we make eye contact with her from our table and motion for the stella.  She points to the end of the bar.  Apparently she served it when we ordered it and then just left it at the bar and never said anything to us.  \n\nI used to like hanging out at Rula Bula, but it seems that lately it's gotten expensive and the service has gone to shit.  I don't know why they tell you that the pints of beer at $4.50, when they are actually $5.50.  I won't go back anytime soon.  I'll stick to Fibbers and The HatRack Pub."
2,"BJs, overall, is a very average restaurant.  I like the variety on their menu, and the food is usually good, but it often takes a long time to get it.  The service is generally good (although we've had a couple of bad experiences), and the atmosphere is pleasant overall.  It really doesn't stand out to me in any way; it's a good place to visit when the mood strikes but not necessarily one of the top restaurants in Desert Ridge."
3,"I love tapas, i am terrible at making decisions so it helps being able to order a few different dishes instead of just one. I recently visited my sister in Seville, Spain, and enjoyed lots of authentic and delicious tapas. So Cafe Andaluz had a lot to live up to.\n\nKelly F and i visited last night and neither of us had been before. It is huge inside and not waht i expected, in a good way. The staff were nice, although we did struggle slightly when ordering drinks due to the language barrier, probably more to do with my funny accent.\n\nWe went for the set menu and of 3 tapas and a dessert for about \u00a312, however, we were both starving and ordered four tapas each. The waiter asked if we wanted to substitute our desserts for the extra tapas which was great as neither of us were fussed about dessert.\n\nWe ordered patatas bavas, baby squid, meat balls, black tiger prawns, marinated chicken, black pudding with chutney, and pork cheek. The dish i as most excited about was the baby squid, but unfortunately i was very disappointed. The bits of squid were tiny, overcooked and covered in far too much batter. The pork cheek was tender and lovely, but the sauce it was in was awful, tasted really peculiar and burnt. However, those are my only 2 complaints. Everything else was delicious, the tiger prawns were really big and juicy and the black pudding was sooooo tasty!\n\nI had a lovely time there and will definitely be back, i just won't order the pork cheek or baby squid. I will try the calamari next time and hopefully that will be better."
4,"Excellent food, service and decent prices for what you get. I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. \nOn my last visit, I had just gotten out of the hospital and needed to eat and was desperately craving...\""REAL GOOD HEARTY FOOD\""!!! I hit the nail in the head with this place!! I had the special of the day which was Mahi-Mahi in a Thai chile lime sauce, served with fire roasted grilled veggies and a fluffy wild rice pilaf with a nice glass of Chardonnay. The fish was fresh & the veggies were not soggy. My meal ended with a slice of their decadent cheesecake and a rich n bold cup of coffee!! Not bad for under $45dllrs for all including tip!!"
4,Living down in Sierra vista 2 years killed me knowing that there is a few yard houses couple hundred miles north. \n\nThey have the BOMBEST onion rings than any other place I've been to! I think there batter is laced with crack. I can eat a entire tower by myself there that good. Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it.\n\nFood there is on the high side but it's worth it. Havnt ordered anything that didn't taste like it came out of a freezer bag. You wont be disappointed. \n\nEvery time I come here I always start with there sampler pack which consists of 6 beers they choose for the month. Your bound to find something that you will like. \n\nSeriously don't come here and order a bud light or a corona. I mean really im sure there are people that just won't try anything new but really though... There will be something you will love just as much if not even better than your pre existing favorite. \n\nThere is usually a tall guy with a beard working the bar every time I come here. He has been here since it opened ad he will find something to quench your thirst :)\n\nIf your like me and have a few to many of those half yards and feel like you may have had a few to much. Dont be a dummy and drive off so the scottsdale PD can give you a DUI. Big no no! then just go walk it off in the fashion square mall.
4,I went to Rooster's for the first time.  I scheduled my appointment using their online booking service which greatly helped me keep my very busy schedule intact.  Taylor did an excellent job trimming up and shaping my beard.  I would gladly recommend him and Rooster's to anyone and I'll be going back this week to have my beard trimmed up again as well as have the complete head shave as well.
4,"Frank and his staff are really know their stuff when it comes to Window Tinting and they have a wide variety of colors and styles to choose from. I had them tint both my house and my office, both having west facing windows which take on alot of sun and heat. They did a great job, didn't even need to be present during the install. I would highly recommend Las Vegas Window Tinting"
3,Got a Groupon for this and am glad I did. We enjoyed ourselves. It was fun to be interactive within the attraction and appreciated the acting. The staff work hard to put on a good show.\nI don't think I would necessarily go again if I didn't have some type of coupon though.
1,"The music playing here is bad enough that I notice it every time and think \""Wow, I'd be hard-pressed to pick worse music,\"" and in fact, bad enough that I saw fit to pull my phone out and take the time to type this. \n\nAlso, they do that obnoxious thing that dumb stores do where at night they turn off one of the automatic doors arbitrarily without putting anything in front of it to let you know. \n\nFinally, they're typically pretty bad about leaving carts scattered around the parking lot. I've counted 22 before. Feel free to use these rogue carts as mobile dumpsters to clean out your car. They'll catch on eventually."
3,"We came on a mellow Sunday morning with the full intent of having a breakfast and then some dessert.\n\nThis was definitely a Willy Wonka experience for adults...though, with less of the fat German kid drinking from the fake brown water river that was supposed to be chocolate and more of a dessert wonderland feeling.\n\nIt was sort of dead which I guess always puts a damper on the whole experience but things did pick up.  Inexplicably, they offered us a table behind the exterior menu board so we ate constantly with a shadow over us.  And I'm pretty sure we photobombed a bunch of people taking their pics with the menu board.\n\nIt took a while to decide but I ordered a dark hot chocolate in their adorable hug mug and their scramble (one of the few savory breakfast items they have on their menu) while hubby went with their Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes.\n\nOur food was pretty darn awesome.  My scramble came with a large piece of baguette and along side it, a little crock each of butter and chocolate.  FOR MY PIECE OF BAGUETTE.  How sinful is that??  I'm not going to lie - butter and choco sauce on bread is to die for.  Wow.  \n\nHubby's pancakes were also probably (we both agreed but he said it first because he took the first few bites) the best pancakes we'd ever had.  It was topped with fried bananas and served with a white chocolate and milk chocolate sauce.  The pancakes didn't appear chocolately but they were still delicious.  \n\nIn the end, we skipped dessert because hubby's pancakes were dessert enough (I had about 1/4 of that bad boy).  Service was nice and perfectly attentive."
1,"Extremely noisy environment but should be expected from a family location. It took an hour for us to receive our food (one of the worst feelings in the world is watching people who were sat well after you, receive their food first). They had apparently \""lost\"" our ticket in the window. They did pay for our drinks (one mimosa and two orange juices), but overall, we were tired and not looking to wait around an hour for sub par food. Two stars for our server who was a nice guy and tried to make the situation tolerable. \n\nI'll go to The Cracked Egg down the road 10/10 times."
4,Great specials. Today was chicken tender wrap $5.99 um um good
3,"It seems the Biosph\u00e8re is in danger, and will close its doors to the public in October. Mmm, what does that say about the general interest in ecology and sustainability in Canada... I admit it, I'm pretty green, I'm your annoying friend with a sustainable water bottle who won't shut up about it. Did you turn off the light when you left the room?\nI also have to admit that, shamefully, I had never, as a Montrealer, set foot in the Biosph\u00e8re before. Still, I can't imagine a sky-view of Montreal without the pretty dandelion globe. \nIt's even more beautiful and surreal in person than it is in pictures, but the interior is surprisingly small and intuitive. There are different exhibitions, all revolving around natural ressources and ecology. The room dedicated to water is pretty fun since YOU have to participate in the activities and get yourself wet! You can even unleash your inner messiah and walk on water! Another cool exhibition highlights how we could reuse waste in the fashion industry, the pieces are not always practical but always pretty neat. My favourite outfit was 98% air according to the wall text! Don't miss the circular cinema room, and get to know the fauna of Quebec (little birdies! Aww)\nWhere you really want to be is at the highest floor, not only is the view spectacular, but it retraces the story of the Biosph\u00e8re and its architect's other projects such as a sustainable more efficient (and stylish) car, or how he gave his name to an atom structure and later to a common office-desk toy (bucky balls!).  \n\nI feel a very special sense of relationship with the Sph\u00e8re: it became such an icon of Expo 67, which had such a great impact on Montreal. I can't help but be proud of it, even if it was, originally, the US pavilion! But a lot of things about it make me unbearably sad: it will close, and I think we'll loose a wonderful part of our history. The lack of funds is felt: some exhibits artifacts don't work, or not as well as they should be. The rooms are a bit of a mumbo-jumbo, why aren't organized by elements? Or regions of the world, or environmental dangers? \nAnd then I feel so small, because even tough the museum highlights how we negatively impact our world, there is no specific section on what we can do to help. What ressources are there, in Montreal, in Canada? \nGo see the dandelion before it's blown away!"
0,"Negative 5 stars if I could; this place is AWFUL! Ok it's inside Walmart so I shouldn't expect too much, but I didn't expect to leave bleeding! I needed to get just one nail fixed and since I was already at Walmart...  \n\nSylvia used the nail dremel on the fresh skin ABOVE my cuticle - my finger skin. Naturally it hurt like hell and I started bleeding. She didn't even notice. She also used the dremel underneath my nail to remove extra acrylic where there wasn't any, separating my skin from my real nail and digging around underneath - ouch! I bled there too. Not until she told me to wash my hands did she notice I was bleeding. The whole time she worked on me (total of 10 mins) she had a serious/distracted/scary look on her face. I'm assuming she had her mind on other things, but that's not an excuse to cause me pain. Causing me to bleed with a machine she uses on MANY people's nails (without washing it in between uses, by the looks of it) is how infection is spread. Do NOT go here, no matter what EVER."
2,"Within a four mile radius of the university is a plethora of Indian restaurants. India Masala is another to add to the mix, but it tends to fall short compared to the others. They serve a lunch buffet from 11:30-3:00 for $10.99. \n\nPrice wise, it is similar to all the others. Where it falls flat is in the offerings. IM offers a variety of dishes that are not often seen at other places. The vegetable korma is a primary example of this point. It was the one I enjoyed the most. The well seasoned mix of mushrooms and potatoes with the mango chutney gave a balanced taste of sweet and savory. The rice in the chicken biryani was also decious. It was soft, pillowy, and flavorful. I scooped around the dried chicken pieces and went with the tandoori instead. Most of the time, it is best to pass on the tandoori because it just sits out and loses all the moisture. Not theirs. Instead, I found it to be tender and moist. Other than those three dishes, I was not impressed.\n\nThe service, on the other hand, was polite and friendly. The decorum, spacious and warm. With so much potential, I hope to see them tweak the menu a bit more. I wouls like to come in for dinner and just order ala carte."
4,I love this place and always have I've been going here ever since they've opened and they never disappoint! I always have to get my nails done by my go to guy Craig who's also the manager he's AMAZING
2,"I suppose that I was a bit harsh in rating the Saguaro based solely on the decor and lack of warmth.  Therefore, I've updated my rating to reflect the warmth of the employeees who were very attentive and pleasant.  I also want to distinguish that this review is not a reflection on the separately-owned Whiskey Bar which was a solid 5 for 5."
4,"I really enjoyed Kunchorn. \n\nThis isn't fine dining, so don't expect that.  But if you are looking for good food, good prices, and friendly people, give Kunchorn a try.\n\nThe restaurant is large and clean.  Apparently the Las Vegas Mah Jong club meets there and has a permanent set up on one side of the restaurant.  \n\nWhen you eat in they include unlimited soup and salad.  So far I have seen egg drop soup and a tom yum soup there.  The salad is just iceberg lettuce, julienned carrots, red onions and a dressing, but it is still nice.  \n\nTheir lunch specials start at $4.99!  \n\nWe had the panang chicken (really good!), pad spicy eggplant (perfectly cooked and seasoned), and the fried calamari (tasty though a little too heavy on the batter).\n\nDefinitely will be trying more of their dishes."
0,"The sauce is terrible, zero flavor, dough is okay, toppings are not the best. As pizza goes, this is the bottom of the line."
0,"I got here at 4pm on a weekday in Dec 2006 and maybe I had the skeleton staff because service really sucked ass. No smile. No checking back. Wrong orders. You gotta be kidding me.\n\nThe gazpacho was good but not extraordinary and to my surprise, the waiter didn't even know what kind of olives I was being served. The sangria was good but... honestly... my glass was more ICE than it was DRINK.\n\nSo sad because 4 years ago I ate at Babareeba in Chicago and had such an amazing experience. Fun, lively, great food, and very knowledgeable waitstaff. I talked about it for the following week!\n\nGoing into the Las Vegas restaurant and asking a simple question about what kind of olives are in the olive appetizer and getting a blank stare as an answer was just the beginning of a disappointing experience."
4,"A very nice gym. There's a cardio room with plenty of machines (treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, etc.) for everyone though I'm sure on particular days at certain times there can be a wait. The weight machines are connected to the cardio room which makes it pretty easy for your exercise routine.\n\nThe layout of the building can be a bit confusing though. I had a hard time finding the free weights room but a staff member happily helped me find it.\n\nThere's also a climbing wall, standard basketball/badminton/whatever hard surface courts, squash courts, and more."
3,Get here early for happy hour. Space is limited to the bar only.
3,"This place is amazing.  It's a bit expensive, but the food is delicious - fresh and unique.  I'm looking forward to going back, though at the price it'll be more of a special-occasion excursion."
4,First time an it was amazing I started with the caprese salad than grilled salmon with kale an potatoes . The salmon was perfectly flakey delish not to mention the beet vinergrette wow an I don't like beets lol my friend ordered the beet burger I did have a bite an I was very impressed. Great taste they lightly fry it or bake but on a bun w avacado n cheese I'll try that next time. I finished that meal off with their turtle cheesecake wonderful it was NY style mmm it was smack your mama delish.Lookin forward to next time an I saw a lot of people ordering the app hush puppies mm
1,"I wasn't impressed not even the slightest, I am from Boston so I am spoiled when it comes to fresh amazing seafood spots. The clams where the size of peas which is what ruined it for me the most. The clam strips where nothing more that a batch of fried batter. I know moving out to the desert I would be giving up my love for seafood on a regular basis, and only being able to indulge when I visit home. I figured i would at least give it a try,but It will probably be the one an only time I ever disappoint myself like this again.  P.S stop adding New England names to to your menu items because its not even comparable to the greatness of back home recipes."
2,"This was my first visit to Piranha to check it out with a group of friends. We went on a night where they had a special text promotion for an all you can drink night for $8. Yes that is what got us to get our asses over to party, they had us at \""all you can drink\"". \n\nWe had a lot of fun, I like how there is inside and outside space to relax, hang out, drink, smoke or whatever it is you do. The outside is cute and looks like a little VIP seating area which is open to all!\n\nThe drink service was good, decent drinks being poured although their maximum pour was 1 1/2 ounce of liquor. No double shots going on here lol.\n\nI danced a little, drank a lot and had a lot of good laughs and some perverted crazy fun with good people.\n\nIf they keep those drink specials up we will be back for sure to party the night away!\n\nThe staff is pretty cool as well so props to them and the security crew for being so chill and welcoming to our large group."
1,"I have been here a few times and have never been impressed and this time was no exception. I decided to give another opportunity and after being brushed off by the hostess I knew nothing had changed. Service remains to be minimal. I ordered a lobster poutine and an order of chicken tenders. The lobster tastes like it comes from a can, the chicken tenders do not come with fries or any sides anymore as they used to, instead they offer the option to buy fries on the side for an extra 4$. I would rather go to moxies or Reuben's.  Same price, much better service and atmosphere, better and healthier selection of food. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant."
0,"Horrible customer service.  Paid $400 to get computer fixed, however after reinstalling computer my printer would not work.  The lady on the phone said they would have to charge me AGAIN for reinstalling proper drivers.  Really?  I will never use these people again."
1,"This should be a great restaurant.  It's in a great location, the menu is interesting, and they have a good wine selection.  But this is not a great restaurant; it's a lazy restaurant.  It's a restaurant that is confident that there aren't other good restaurants in town, and that they can coast a little bit because we have no real choice when we want good food.  \n\nAlas for you Luna, you are deceived because  this is not true anymore. There are a lot of good places to eat now.  And in those places, the tables aren't jammed together so closely that you can hear the most intimate details of strangers' conversations (spoiler alert: the conversations are about whether other people can hear the conversation). And in those other places, the portions are not tiny, like sad little retro homages to late 80s nouvelle cuisine. And in those other places, the food arrives at your table in under 40 minutes. \n\nI really used to like how haphazard Luna was when it was on campus. There was a sort of charm in not really knowing if you would get the food you ordered. But this charm has worn thin, and the last time I ate at Luna (last week), the disjunction between the price and the quality of the food was too great.  No way."
2,"This is a typical Pittsburgh sandwich place.  I had the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which wasn't anything like the cheesesteaks I had when I used to live in Philly, not that I really expected it to be in Pittsburgh.  But the meat was kind of dry with no flavor.  However, it was HUGE and fairly cheap for what you get.  It was supposed to come with mayo which I declined and it came with fries inside the sandwich.  I realize this is a Pittsburgh thing but fries really don't belong INSIDE a cheesesteak.  I ordered the sandwich to go (there isn't a lot of indoor seating) and it took awhile for a simple sandwich when there was only one other person waiting.  However, I did enjoy playing the pinball machines while I waited.  I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this place, but maybe their other sandwiches are better.  They do have some interesting vegetarian/vegan options (like a Seitan cheesesteak) that may appeal to some people that would be hard to find elsewhere."
1,"Came to the Wynn for the buffet but with a 2 hour wait, we decided to eat here instead. Service was ok but a little slow. We came with a group of 8. We ordered around 10 dishes total and asked the server if it was enough food. He assured us it would be but alas it was not. The food itself is pretty tasty but the portion size left us all wanting for more. Pan fried noodles and the roast duck were the two dishes that particularly stuck out in my mind.  It might be unfair to compare this place to more authentic chinese restaurants in LA but can't help it, sorry."
0,"Claim Jumpers used to be one of our favorites. But this is and will be our last time. \n\nGluten free pasta? No more muffins? No more cheese bread? Cold chicken wings? Soggy salad? They might as well shut the doors now, most of the favorites are no longer available, not even on the \""secret menu\"" the waitress said. \n\nTruly a shame. Only 7:30pm and the place was empty. I guess our waitress was so bored, she was yawning as she took our order. The kitchen staffing have been falling asleep too..one of the entr\u00e9es was cold as were the appetizer chicken wings."
4,"Great practice, and staff. The doctors are on point and always made me feel comfortable and listened to my concerns and needs and were willing to work around my anxiety and stress and make me feel comfortable and in control. The assistants are all beautiful inside and out and the front office staff always greeted me with a smile and took the time to discuss financial questions and options that I had. My cleaning was performed by a very competent hygienist who took the time to educate me on my deeper pockets and what I could do to get my gums healthy again. \n\nI know the staff really care here and I can only recommend people to come to this office."
3,"This is an excellent restaurant, though not without its faults. It's expensive for sure, and not a place I'd eat regularly for that reason - I find other spots nearby offer good steaks at much lower prices - but I'm happy to splurge from time to time.\n\nAll the steaks are quite excellent, cooked perfectly, and nicely seasoned. The sides are very interesting and unique - I especially enjoy the potato puree. For desert, the Toffee Pudding is ridiculously awesome, and almost worth the trip just for that.\n\nIn my two visits, I found the staff at the front desk to be pretty cold. The first time, we arrived on time for our reservation, but waited more than 30 minutes to be seated, and they didn't seem to much care. Once inside, the wait staff was great, and took care of all our needs."
2,"Par un froid apr\u00e8s-midi d'hiver alors que nous d\u00e9ambulions dans le Vieux-Montr\u00e9al, nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'entrer au Pub St-Paul pour assouvir notre soif et notre petite faim.\n\nAu 2e \u00e9tage d'un vieil \u00e9difice, apr\u00e8s un escalier pentu se trouve une salle en bois et en pierre d\u00e9cor\u00e9e avec une guitare G\u00c9ANTE au plafond. Un bar se trouve au centre, les tables se trouvent des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la pi\u00e8ce, pr\u00e8s des fen\u00eatres, une des vues donnant sur la rue St-Paul, l'autre donnant sur le port. Il y a aussi un 3e \u00e9tage ou se trouve la cuisine et les salles de bains.\n\nLe menu bar est tentant, la table d'h\u00f4te n'est pas ch\u00e8re. youppi !\nNous prenons les ailes de poulet (frites) la sauce est go\u00fbteuse et les ailes sont charnues.\nLes nachos sont tr\u00e8s copieux mais ils ont l'air pr\u00e9par\u00e9s depuis longtemps ( le fromage a d\u00e9ja eu le temps de figer alors qu'on vient tout juste de nous apporter le plat.) \nLes boissons sont assez dispendieuses pour un simple bar (9$ un drink)\n\nLe service est agr\u00e9able. La musique est bonne. Nous reviendrons probablement !"
4,Just got back from my first experience at Weera Thai and I am very excited. This place has really good Thai food for reasonable prices. The lunch special was $7 and  is the best Thai food I have had.  This place will be a regular spot for me and I will definitely be taking my friends and family there when they come to visit.
1,"Bought into the hype with all those yelp reviews. The burgers were pleasant, but not extraordinary. \n\nTried the no carb burger, the veggie burger, and sides.\n\nNo carb was just that. Burger smushed between onion, tomato, and mushrooms.\n\nThe veggie burger was a patty made of lentils and rice, and some other stuff. Tasted nice.\n\nSides were ok as well. Zucchini, sweet potatoe, and regular fries.\n\nMy opinion is that for the price you're paying here, you'll get a better deal, and just as tasty over at Shake Shak."
2,"Before I got to Imperial Palace, I was expecting to wake up with cockroaches in my bed after reading all the negative reviews on Yelp and everywhere else, but honestly it really wasn't that bad. It's def NOT fancy and I didn't stay on the dreaded Tower 4 (we were in Tower 5), but we were in the room only to sleep and shower so it served our needs fine. \n\nIt looked like they had perhaps redone the showers as they were very clean, even the shower head. The towels were clean, the sheets were clean, the TV worked, and the beds and pillows didn't make me sore in the morning. \n\nI actually found the \""Dealtainers\"" funny and ended up watching them when they performed. Not many tables in the place, but I ended up winning quite a bit on their slots so the casino gets a thumbs up from me. They also have a karaoke bar upstairs that can be fun, if you're drunk and into that sort of thing lol.\n\nOk, here's the bad news: DO NOT go to the restaurants in this place! The smell alone will drive you away I'm sure. IP has a club (I think the Rockhouse?) which was loud enough to clearly hear in the room. I was singing along to the songs playing at 2am, not good when your flight is at 5am. This was probably because the sliding door to the balcony was coming off the track so it was impossible to close all the way. Also, I wouldn't walk around barefoot in the hallways....or anywhere for that matter in this place.\n\nOverall, for $25 a night I would stay there again. As long as they didn't put me in Tower 4!"
1,"I'm not changing the rating, but I wanted to add that I called the hotel to inquire about my charges, and the manager Megan was very nice and helpful. We sorted out the charges in about five minutes and everything was taken care of."
3,Awesome place to buy snakes and fish supplies. I like that they are locally owned. Good for the local economy. Not that I have anything against a place like petsmart but this place is friendly good prices and most important to me locally owned.
0,I have been going to this place for six years. I have been thinking about switching for a long time now but I was trying to give it a chance. Wait times can be ridiculous.  I don't feel like the staff knows what they are doing nor do I feel comfortable anymore trusting them with my health. They do not listen well and assume I am healthy because I am young. I have been perscribed the wrong medicine for something I didn't even have. I really wanted to give this place a chance but I just have not had a good experience there. I don't feel like I have a lot of help or understanding with my help there. I don't feel like I'm going to a doctors office. It seems like they are just running a business and that's it. No genuine care for the patients and there health. I would not recommend anyone to go to this gynecologist
1,"Not keen on this one. Doesn't have anywhere near the ambience of the Thistle Street branch. Food is meh, staff are pretty and act like it. Granted I only had the light bites, the menu didn't really have me itching to return.\n\nZero atmosphere, all trying a bit too hard to be too cool for school. And in this neighbourhood, they're competing with the heavyweights. All in all a pretty blah post-sunday market option. I'll choose Hamiltons or Hectors in future."
1,"The pesto was lacking flavor. I was really hoping they would live up to their name, but highly disappointed. Their pasta was good though as well as their pie."
2,"We had the dry aged sirloin, after all the first time at any restaurant one must try the signature dish.  Greatly disappointed, not very tender, lots of tough connective tissue, medium rare was closer to medium.  We ask the waiter what grade of meat was used and he answered \""choice.\""  The lack of marbeling was more like select.  Steak flavor was good.  Overall, not worth the $43.00 each.  Baked potato was like rubber, siting in the warmer too long.  The salads were excellent."
3,"NOTE - This review is based on a previous visit to Moon (March 24,2007) during Hugh Hefner's 81st birthday weekend extravaganza at the Palms casino. Now that I'm on Yelp, thought I would write a review on it :) \n\n- Right off the bat, I wasn't a fan of taking an elevator up to a club, considering there were hordes of people waiting to get in. It helped that we had a connection that evening.  Well, it was THE night for Hef's 81st birthday so that pretty much explained the extremely long line.\n- First, we were taken to the Playboy club which allowed party goers to mingle, grab a few drinks or gamble at the tables hosted by yours truly, Playboy dealers. \n- Drinks were pricey but that's expected. To begin the evening, the bachelor (that's me) bought a round of 120 proof burbon shots for the crew. Result? One of my buddies, who doesn't really drink decided he wanted in but I did offer him a broken down golf cart LOL What a mistake! He called it a night before we even made it up to Moon.\n- Of course, there was Hef along with the original \""Girls Next Door\"" in a booth and I had the opportunity to talk to Kendra for a few minutes after she found out I was getting married the following month. In her words, \""Are you sure????\"" LOL nice. Then it was time for everyone to make their way to Moon nightclub.\n- A definite upgrade from Rain nightclub the night before. I'll admit, I was impressed with the decor and layout. What probably impressed me the most of the view from the outdoor patio, providing a stunning view of Las Vegas. Later that evening, the roof opened up, a beam of white light shined upon us and next thing you know we're in an alien ship! LOL \n- Obviously, Hollywood graced their presence in the club. Not surprising, Paris and her rendition of a stripper along with a friend and a pole. I've seen better.......dances LOL\n- Girl/Guy ratio that evening? All I remember seeing were 20-30 ladies dancing a top the VIP booths going nuts! It was INSANE in there. I remember one guy who tried to blend himself in with the ladies, eventually found himself being grabbed by bouncers after refusing to come down. What made it worse, they ripped his shirt. \n- Music was at the top of its game, a blend of hiphop, r&b, electro and top hits.\n- At one point in the night, the entire club took a 10 minute break while they sang \""happy birthday\"" to Hef. \n\nOverall, a great time at Moon nightclub. I haven't been back to this particular club since 2007 so any of the more recent reviews would give you an idea of how this club is doing."
2,"Ehhh \n\nIt's $1-3 sushi. You don't expect much. But freshness is all gone now ! Maybe because summer in az is so slow for business.\n\nHad salmon and even as Asian as I am couldn't swallow it o-o). Lol and albacore looked like dried jerky !  \n\nW that being said it's spinning sushi, can't be fresh though this location lately is bad , but Kids love them! Lol so 3 stars for cheap, happy kids meal!  But stay away from anything raw .    He likes egg sushi and coconut shrimp.    \n\nServer is alway pleasant  :)  I'll just let the kid eat his non raw items and I'll eat at home lol"
3,"The prices were decent, first off!!!  The ramen was awesome!  My friend and I both ordered appetizers first.  We ordered California rolls and Gyoza to munch  on prior and they were each like $5 for 6 each which is decent and they were delicious!!\n\nMy friend had the Shoyu ramen.  It was really good, the portion is BIG!!! I had Kotsu(something I can't pronounce -_-) with ramen and it was really good.  I enjoyed the ramen noodles, they seemed like they were freshly made there.\n\nThe Boba...were delicious, enviable to Tea Station. :-)"
3,"We had a lot of fun at this restaurant. The food was great, our waiter was very nice and the restaurant had a lot of theme going on to make it stand out. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could."
1,"3 of us went for Saturday lunch. \""Skinny Chick\"" lunch special is ANY salad and light beer for $8. No * by the special indicating fine print. But they charged me $2 for the chicken in my BBQ CHICKEN chop salad. Obviously $2 isn't much, but it's the principle and was just extra annoying after the already poor service!\n\n* One of us asked for no mayo or cheese on a burger. Got both\n* One of us asked for an American Burger with turkey patty. Got a beef patty.\n* However, my BBQ chicken chop salad was yummy! Even if they did charge me $2 more for chicken...\n\nWill return for drinks, not food"
1,"My love affair with XS has officially ended.\n\nReason #503: DJ playing four Katy Perry songs back to back which can NEVER be justified in my book. \nReason #504: I'm sorry to say this, but waaaaay too many Asians. I was the only Asian in my group of six so when we were approached with the pick up line \""Non-Asians, what's up?\"" you can imagine how awkward it was when they found out I was only a fake non-Asian =( \nReason #505: Rude and unreasonable bouncers and security. \nReason #506: Long lines that take forever and horrible crowd management. \n\nandddddddddd I can go on and on..."
1,It delivers on the name. I stopped in after work for a drink and never tried the food but this is not my kind of place.
0,"Rude unhelpful staff, difficult parking, actual rooms are across the street in another building (which they don't tell you,  they just just let you wander the casino till you get in line again) Seriously ready to drive back to Los Angeles or maybe find a motel 6... It might be classier"
4,Very busy this Saturday morning.  But we did get a table in about 10 minutes.  Being this busy I expected slower service but as soon as we sat down Hilda showed up with a smile and took our order.  Clean and friendly service.
1,"My little sister loves this place. She is a regular. I cannot handle it. At all.\n\nIt's a rock/biker bar. I like electronic and pop music, so there is that. I am sure my 15 year old angst-y self would have loved this place. I just can't handle it. Not my crowd, not my scene.\n\nDepending on whether there is a band playing, there may or may not be a cover charge. I don't pay to club 90% of the time (and I never pay cover, ever) and I sure as hell will not be paying to see some band that is playing too loudly and I won't be around for more than an hour.\n\nThe layout here is really nice for being a rock venue. The bathrooms should be relabeled sex room because every time I have come here, there is some BOOM BOOM happening in there.\n\nVamp'd is not my jam. My flavor. My happs. I do appreciate that when I do stop by I stand out like a sour thumb in whatever color I am wearing and/or that I can show up to this place completely ratchet."
1,Very quaint place. Friendly staff but it's cafeteria style with full service prices.  Everything on the menu is per item and you need to add everything. Also you need to get up and get your own drinks  Example. Eggs came by themselves then i ordered a bagel then i ordered potatoes and 2 strip of bacon  no coffee or drink. The bill was $15.  Not terrible but not great especially you are not being served.  food was fine nothing outstanding better value at other places.
4,I was happy I found this store. All the other Skateboard shops I found where way to expensive but this one had a larger variety and the two guys who worked there were really nice. All there shoes where also cheaper and they had styles I had not seen in a while.
3,"Went here twice on a recent 4 day trip to the area.  The first time was for the gelato, the second time was more for the free wifi.\nDidn't really love the quality of the gelato, it was decent, but they get an extra star for fun flavors, like Bailey's and Samoas (the girl scout cookies)."
4,This place is a relaxing environment and you feel it when you walk it. I had a reading done there and I loved it.
0,"Use to go to this gym and I like it, but they are nothing but scam artists. Avoid this gym. My debit card expired and because I hadn't been in a few months prior to its expiration, I'd forgotten to cancel the membership.\n\nI was billed for several months, which isn't a problem because I did plan to go back, and the charges went through until I got my new card. Today I called to find out what late fees I needed to pay since I wanted to start going again.\n\nAfter calling the main headquarters, I was told that all of the Las Vegas gyms are franchises. So I called the gym and found out I was in collection for missing 3 months of payments at $19.95. No problem. I was fully prepared to pay the $60 and then the additional $20 to restart my membership.\n\nI called collections and they told me I owed $371. Are you kidding? Here's where it gets good. Missing the three months only accounted for $60 of that total. Then I was charged an additional $25 every time they tried to charge the card + collections fees + 18% interest on the amount. $321 in additional fees.\n\nThere is no way in hell that I'm paying $371 to these scam artists. I actually like the gym, but the company policy of continued attempts to bill an inactive card, is unethical. They knew the card wasn't active because I used the card to sign up, complete with expiration date and all. \n\nI called LVAC and set up a meeting for tomorrow. $19.95 per month, same as I paid at Gold's. I guess Gold's is attempting to lose customers with its ridiculous billing policy."
0,"I have never experienced such poor customer service at a hair salon. I recently moved to the neighborhood, and although I would NEVER go to Fantatic SAMs for a color or Highlight I assumed that they couldn't mess up a wash and blow dry?!?\nSady, I was mistaken.\nI made an appointment with Rachel for a wash and blowout for a wedding that I was attending that afternoon. I confirmed my appointment twice as I would be flying to Palm Springs right after. I got to my appointment at 9:00 am. Upon arrival, I was then informed that Rachel had the day off and my name had been erased from the appointment time! The person went through the trouble in canceling my hair appointment, but didn't have the professional courtesy to call the client and let me know?!? No one was available to service me either. Had I had the heads up I would've been able to book elsewhere. So upset and disappointed!! \nMost unprofessional salon experience ever!!"
3,"Great vibe, great food, great service!  I went for a Sunday brunch and had the tres leches french toast....so delightful!  The bacon that it came with was soooo salty and I like salt! lol  I also did the unlimited mimosas which were delicious were a little on the warm side.  Sat at the bar and the bartender was very sweet and she was attentive so you didn't have to wait long for refills!"
4,"So we are on vacation.. and after walking miles and miles of the Las Vegas strip.. a Pedi and massage was exactly what we needed. There was 3 of us and Kay, Lee and their team was so on it.. 3 pedis and 2 manis. Kay was amazing.. She really worked my feet and toes.. I love it.. Lee worked on my moms and she was in heaven too. The pricing is really inexpensive... 30 bucks for a great pedi. Its great to know what someone can just walk in and get a wonderful mani and pedi? I completely suggest seeing Kay, Lee and the whole fam bam for great service!!!"
0,"Bought three pastries here. One of them was good, service was a little sketchy, I'm pretty sure the lady at the register pulled a Houdini and double charged us 7 dollars. Authentic taste, but I want my money back #wheredembands"
4,"I absolutely love this place. Every time I go the bartenders are so friendly and clearly enjoy talking to their customers. They have really good daily specials and a nice happy hour. For food I love the grilled cheese and the stuffed olives. The arancini are also nice for a light snack. Also if you're a wine drinker, make sure to try their house wines. I was pleasantly suprised!"
0,"I hate to beat a dead horse, but this is, by far, THE WORST McDonald's I've ever been to. I don't usually eat at McDonald's, but the kids seem to enjoy the play area at this location.  It's a shame that everything else is in such disarray.\n\n-ALL of the tables were dirty with leftover food and grease. You may think I'm joking. Nope. ALL of them.\n\n-The utensil/drink area was covered with trash, napkins, straws, and spilled soda.\n\n-The ketchup dispenser was out of ketchup.\n\n-There was no iced tea in the dispenser.\n\n-The girl that took our order definitely did NOT want to be there. Mumbling. Looked depressed. I can understand that by the working conditions.\n\n-Both of my hamburgers were cold--the cheese was not melted. We don't come here for the food anyways, so I wasn't expecting much.\n\n-My wife asked for no cheese and no sauce--it had cheese and sauce on it.\n\n-Asked for apples instead of fries for our kid's meals. They got fries.  We went up to the counter and they were very hesitant in giving us the apples. They were going to charge us for the apples.  Oh my.  They finally just gave them to us.\n\n-There was spilled ice cream on the floor that was sitting there for who knows how long. We had to ask someone to clean it up. The worker used a dust pan, not a mop. There was still ice cream left on the floor after he left. Another customer had to clean it up.\n\nPlease CLOSE this McDonald's. Don't ever visit this location. No matter how much your kids beg you. Never."
2,Wayyyyyyyyyyyy too expensive.
0,"Seriously?! $60 later my family still has empty belly's because their food was so terrible. We left all 3 of our plates full on the table. The presentation was sloppy & the taste left little to be desired. I would hardly consider their food authentic italian. Its a good slogan though. Honestly their food is more like over priced & overcooked slop. When we spoke to the owner about our food we were insulted & told that we don't know good food. My husband ordered lasagna, my son spaghetti, & I ordered the gnocchi based off of the snobby waitresses recommendation who said I would not be disappointed. She promised. The owner did nothing to resolve the situation. I would not recommend this overpriced, pretentious, dump to ANYONE."
0,is this place still in business? as I called today and got disconnected recording?
1,"why was it that there was only two employees working the floor while the store was so busy? i don't understand. a woman walked in and bought 12 bags, to send to friends as gifts and to send over seas to family. if you ask me, that's damn generous and i can see why an employee would want to assist her immediately. however, what were the other 15+ people going to do with only 1 associate available? i'll tell you. they will pull each other's hair, step on each other's toes, talk shit to/about one another, etc. it was crazy. NO THANKS. i found a bag that i liked. but, i wasn't going to literally fight for the sales person's attention with all these other crazy people. i'm sure that i can get it the next time i make a trip out to vegas. it's really not that serious. but really, only 2 people available on the floor? that's horrible!!"
2,"Cyprus Grill is a good stop-off for a yummy Greek lunch.  The spot delivers solid gyros, chicken, and lamb pitas, lemony, feta-y Greek fries, big salads with fresh ingredients, and acceptable avgolemono (chicken lemon rice soup).  Their pitas are great - soft and fluffy.  But nothing on the menu is stand-out.  I'd recommend it for a quick and satisfying weekday lunch at reasonable prices, but wouldn't suggest it for any of your more serious meal pursuits."
4,"Came in as a walk-in and was seated immediately for a mani-pedi. (Chalk it up to luck I always expect to wait at any salon without an appointment). I selected a $35 summer shimmer pedicure which included exfoliation and massage. It was great! Also worth it for a servers legs. \n\n$25 for my gel manicure, coming to a total of $60 + tip. \n\nTweety and all other staff are very accommodating and make a point to remember my name. This is right down the street from my house so I love that service matches the convenience. \n\nI'm a new regular!"
1,"The food was pretty good for a diner, but definitely not worth the wait... the service was terrible (somewhat rude, but more disorganized than anything)\n\nAfter waiting in line for 40 minutes, we sat down and were told that the cook needed to catch up on orders... 30 minutes later we saw a waitress behind the counter taking orders from people who just sat down. when we asked if we could place our orders, we got a pretty rude/sassy lecture along the lines of  \""didnt we already tell you that the cook was catching up on orders\""  *(yeah, you told us that THIRTY MINUTES AGO... for real...how longs it take to make eggs?)..  when we pointed out that people that just sat down were having orders taken, our waitress asked the cooks and apparently it was ok.... after 30 additional minutes... average pancakes and eggs came out.\n\nagain... 1 hour and 40 minutes for so-so pancakes/eggs with a side rude waiters that had no idea what they were doing. \n\nSave yourself a few hours and go to Ritters"
4,"I knew about, but hadn't tried the new Decatur location.  I knew all was well when the owner came out and said \""Welcome back--we haven't seen you in almost 6 months.\""\n\nI went with the Bulgogi burrito and my son had the beef burrito.  excellent as usual.  What more is there to say other than that we will be back to try more of the fusion items...."
4,"Great food (blackened red fish was AMAZING), and excellent service. Fun for the whole family. Definitely going back!!!"
0,"Went there for the \""first 200 on us\"" promotion.  Of course there is a catch but you gotta read the fine print.  Regardless, came over and had dinner at biscayne and then hit the casino.   It was fine, I was up then I was down.  Wanted to stay longer but combination of the sickening coconut smell with cigarette smoke was just too disgusting.  Could only take an hour.  Fortunately at that point I was up."
3,The people in there were just great to us. In particular the RN in the cardiac unit that helped me (Morgan) was so cheerful and helpful he really took the edge off of being there. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the facility. Yes an older facility will be a bit worn but things that are fixable should be. The hinges on my bathroom door screamed at all hours of the night (and others did as well) and the water faucet shook the whole room when turned on due to air in the lines. Both of these could be remedied with a maintenance person in there for less then 30 minutes.\n\nAll in all though both my wife and I have been admitted to John C. Lincoln and we trust them to take good care of us when needed.
4,"Ate at this location two times in a row.  I love the #4 (turkey, sprouts) on wheat bread.  Love the fresh seven grain bread, turkey and cheese.  These sandwiches are way better than Subway, etc.  \n\nDuring yesterday's (Friday) visit, the staff were heard singing along to the music playing, which was nice to see/hear.  It's nice to see people enjoying their jobs. \n\nToday, I had ordered my food through the drive thru.  My one of two sandwiches ordered was made incorrectly using French roll rather than wheat bread.  The staff were quick to fix the minor mistake. \n\nGreat sandwiches, nice staff..just wish there was a location in the Aliante area but worth the drive."
4,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!  Great, classic food with a twist.  Something different but not too different.  Great atmosphere, great staff, great concept!  I have been here countless time and taken anyone that says they have never been and everyone loves it!  Unique, fun, clean convenient, and GREAT food!!"
4,"First time here. Everything was delish! They even gave us sour dough bread and a decadent dessert. The iced tea was probably the best ice had anywhere, which may sound silly, but if a restaurant can't do the simple things well, why try anything else. This place does it all right."
1,"The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty good. Friendly staff,  but bad service during non - happy hour time. 2 tables were only being served (including our's), but it seems that our server is you busy chit-chatting with other waiters. Ordered Spider roll, not as what I expected from the reviews. Oxtail soup what ok, bland. Can't go wrong with mango mochi, just well presented in a plate. Also, we didn't know we are 10 minutes before happy hour until I heard the other party next to our table. The waitress gave them an option if they're ordering for happy hour, they can wait for a couple of minutes.  That's our waitress,  but she never gave us that option. Anyway, if you have time to drive a few minutes for a great Oxtail soup, I'll go to California Hotel & Casino instead."
1,One of the worst walmarts I've been too. They start stocking the shelves in the evening when it's very busy so they have huge carts moving around and blocking isles. The whole place is very loud and they don't have enough check out isles open. Don't go here thinking it will be a quick experience.
1,"I guess im not scene enough for this place.  Guys in girl pants, here is your venue. Its really small, tries to combine to many different facets, and the bands they book are typically emo / pop rock bands.  On occasion theyve had a random local punk show, but for the most part this place is for the journal writing, scarf wearing, horn rimmed glasses crowd.  Some of the art is decent,  it has a kind of co-op/ food not bombs feel, and the staff is nice enough,  just not my crowd i guess."
2,Had breakfast at the one in Planet Hollywood Casino.  It was pretty good.  Kind of greasy but makes good drunk food.
4,"Delicious food, great service, good music and environment, friendly staff and very reasonable prices! And the best mojitos in town!!"
4,"We go here over Starbucks now, which says a lot because I used to work at Starbucks and I roast my own coffee at home. With tat being said, they are always quick and my beverage is always tasty. I prefer this place because it is less crowded and I can get in and out quicker than Starbucks."
4,Wanted to stop in but had that raven banner up just can't do it !
2,Wanted to like this. Service was great but like some of the other reviews. Overcooked meat is overcooked meat.
3,"Every time my husband tries to get me into an electronic store I immediately get nauseous and try to get out of it. We don't have Fry's in Hawaii so I hesitantly dragged myself into this store. I have been here before but I don't remember it and I normally block out electronic stores in my mind.\n\nAnyway, this place is huge. I walk in and think of something I need. Hmm...I need a reading light for my Kindle so I don't make my husband suffer as he tries to sleep. I have to say they have so many unnecessary but entertaining things to buy. The inner geek in me started looking at the toys and gadgets and all the other electronics, exercise equipment, and other odd things you would normally not find in an electronic store. I actually had an entertaining time in there and had to remind my husband of his nonexistent time limit. Husband was happy, I was happy, we are all happy. Fry's made a break through. It's the only electronic store I can bear with a time limit."
0,"Blue Martini seems to be having an identity crisis. They seem to be constantly changing the vibe of the place in order to bring back the crows. The thing is, it is not bring the kind of crowed it use to. The music ranges from mediocre to just shoot me already. After last night's experience, we will not be going back.\n\nAlthough this did not happen to me this time, the server padded the bill of another couple we were with. Not sure if she thought she could get away with it since my friends were drunk. \n\nIts sad really. This place use to be one of our favorites about 4 years ago."
4,"This store is fantastic - staff members are always helpful and the selection of games is great.  This is one of the first game stores I checked out after moving to the Madison area and I have avoided going to others because I like this one so much.  In addition, they hold great events every day during the week, they really have a game for everyone."
0,"Look for another doctor. Don't wast your time. If I could rate 0 stars I would.\n\nDr. Alamo is rude and arrogant. He doesn't make much eye contact and seemed disinterested in discussing symptoms past related medical history. Was very quick to make recommendations for costly tests. I spent more time sitting in the waiting room and with an asst then I did with him. I can see he is a busy doctor but if health is so important to him then giving a little better care to patients is not asking too much. I enjoyed receiving a letter of severance in the mail today 10/19/2012 that was dated 10/03/2012 noting he will no longer be my doctor. This stems from my calls to his office trying to get test results, a request for his recommendations in writing for me to review and noting to his staff how poorly he treats patients and that I would be looking for another physician. I did not get the requested list of his recommended tests."
0,"We came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live. We were very excited to see a BBQ joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food. Being from KC I know what good BBQ taste like and some of the best places are set up like this one but this wasn't even close when it came to good or even acceptable BBQ. They had a huge smoker in back but it wasn't used for the BBQ we had. Since we live very close we really wanted to like this place because the closest decent BBQ place is 20 miles away. \n\nWe bought a sample plate because we love BBQ and wanted to get a good idea of what their's was like. The food tasted old, like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it. The beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an old burnt taste. The smoker in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was done in an oven a week before. \n\nLike I said very disappointed... don't waste your money."
0,"We visited my wife's aunt in Vegas. She insisted we go to this bar and grill for dinner. What a disappointment. 2 of us ordered the fish and chips after being assured by the server that this was \""Excellent\"". Apparently his definition of excellent is the same as my definition of horrible. It was frozen cod in batter about 3/8 inch batter top and bottom and so hard you could use it as a sanding block. \n\nYou would think that I could have let the server know, but we didn't see him until he delivered the check about 25 minutes later. I have 1 suggestion for him. It looks like you hate your job, go find one where you don't have to work with the public. Maybe he just didn't like working.\n\nMy wife had the patty melt. At least that was edible, but nothing to rave about. I can easily say that I will never return to this establishment."
1,"Went there twice . The first time the waitress was one of the worst we have ever had. We were grabbing a bite to eat before a movie at the then Rave cinemas in Town Square and we let her know that. She assured us that we would make it with time to spare. 20 mins.close to the movie we had still not received our meal, when we asked her what was the status she told us it would have been ready in a few minutes. 5 minutes later the same answer was given . 10 minutes till she brashly told us that if we had not ordered meals that took so long we would have eaten and been on our way! WE ORDERED PRE COOKED BEEF BRISKET AND A HAMBURGER. After waiting for close to an hour we asked for the manager who competently took care of the situation comped the meal and gave us a new server. We missed our movie and ended up waiting an additional two hours for the next movie but the new server was nice and the meal was good. Against our better judgement we decided to try it again and the service was much better. The food is comfort food, so it's not really anything that cannot be had at many other places, but not sure we will go back there again. The one bonus is that it is close to the theater."
2,Had the shrimp tacos. They were pretty good. A little on the expensive side for fast food.
0,I got two slices of pizza togo\n I got home open the box\nI can see they put more cheese on top before they reheat it\nSo one was differnt kinda weird i wont be going back\nThe pizza was bad pizza hut or dominoes is better pizza\nNasty overall was expecting way more disapointed \nWaste of money i could have gotten a. Whole medium pizza\nFrom dominoes at least the quaity is better\nTake your old overpriced pizza and shove it!
4,This place is always changing and always takes my breathe away...it's always a nice escape from the hustle of bustle and really gives u time to appreciate everything...a must see when u come to vegas
2,"If you happen to have superhuman mutant night vision and an affinity for good steaks, then this is the place for you.  My filet mignon was DELISH, problem was I couldn't see it.  The place was completely dark save for a few candles and by the end of my spring mix salad (which was fresh and yummy), I was secretly wishing for a Paris Hilton cam just so I would be able to see what I was eating.  Additionally they crank up the music so loud you have to basically shout at your dinner companions.  \n\nThe food was good - the steak sauces that came with the filet were amazing and the seabass was fresh and tasty and perfect.  The presentation of the food, what I saw of it at least - assisted with cell phone lighting, was pretty.\n\nThere were some damn fine waiters walking around, but the service SUCKED.  This place operates similar to a club, where all attention is directed to the cash money millionaires and the wads of paper flowing out of their Prada suits - homeboy at the adjacent table was practically having his feet licked by the wait staff.  Our waiter disappeared after our food was served and a busser served us dessert without spoons which took a good 10 minutes for them to correct, and by that time the ice cream had melted.\n\nSTACK: very trendy place with great food and sucky service."
1,"While at the recent Chandler Beer and BBQ festival, I decided to give Honey Bears a try.  I had never been there before and have heard them mentioned as one of the great BBQ joints in the Phoenix area. \n\nWhat a disappointment. The ribs we ordered were tough and gristly and tasted like they had been \""quick-cooked\"". I've made and eaten enough ribs to know when a piece of meat has been rushed. My guess is they were scrambling to meet the high demand of the event and took some shortcuts. (It was later in the day) If thats the case I would say its a shame to sacrifice quality to make a buck. \n\nWith all the new BBQ places popping up in the Phoenix area, there's no room for the ones that compromise. Just my luck with 20+ BBQ booths to choose from at the festival I picked the one that obviously does."
4,"This place is awesome. I just saw High School Musical here, that Coach Bolton should win a Tony...\nIn all seriousness my daughter got into theatre here and has had a wonderful time. Great Children's theatre. Once you do a couple shows here, you know everyone and it's like family. My daughter and wife have made some great friendships here. Wonderful asset for the community.\nHas adult shows also."
1,"Coffee has went down. No big deal anymore.  They used to also have a good sweet selection.  Got a chocolate chip cookie which cost over $2 and it was as thin as a mint, and no bigger than a chip ahoy.  Also got a scone which used to be very good. Now they come in a plastic wrap, individually wrapped. That means mass produced and not local anymore. Tasted like one you get at Fry's.  $10 for this garbage."
0,"I just spoke with the owner on the phone after calling to find out when their new facility would open. As we talked I was explaining that the staff at the daycare facility I use in Illinois (www.k-9playtimeinc.com) actively engages the dogs in play and has tennis balls everywhere. She said that toys generally are not allowed (I spoke only of tennis balls, not toys) and that she is seriously considering using \""REMOTE SHOCK COLLARS\"" on the dogs in her care if they are \""causing problems.\""\n\n'Nuff said.\n\n\nUpdate:\nSome science on shock collars:\nhttp://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/are-electronic-shock-collars-painful-or-just-annoying-to-dogs-a-new-study-r\n\nOn the myth of using dominance to explain dog behavior:\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090521112711.htm\n\nA good article on finding good daycare: http://seattletimes.com/html/tailsofseattle/2018722675_trainer_qa_how_to_find_a_good_dog_day_care.html"
1,"I hadn't been over to March\u00e9 Saint-Jacques for a while (been traveling, etc.), but needed to pick up some cheese from the Fromagerie Atwater branch there, so headed over earlier today.  Outside the building, there was a small farmers market, with maybe five or ten booths, as well as a sign noting that it only happened on Fridays.  So guess I chose the right day to go.  \n\nAnyway, I went into the building and was immediately astounded to discover that literally every shop except the Fromagerie Atwater had closed.  It was a ghost building.  If the cheese counter hadn't expanded into some of the adjacent space, it would been even worse.  The cheese counter was great, as always--decent selection of Quebec and international cheeses, with very helpful staff--but it was so disappointing to find that the rest of the place had shut down.  There used to be a bakery, a fresh pasta shop, a place that sold olives and olive oil, a branch of the La Mer fish shop, etc.  Now I'm worried that Fromagerie Atwater's days in the location are also numbered, which would be a real loss, since there aren't any other good cheese shops nearby."
0,"Not impressed.  Their communication with clients is seriously lacking.  Took our dog in for a fecal due to parasites.  They ran the tests and when I picked up the medication, the most basic questions were answered with \""I think so\"" or \"" That SHOULD be okay\""  when dealing with medication and a life, \""thinking\"" and \""should\"" aren't comforting.  I want to know definitively if giving medications together will cause an issue and is permissible.  \nThe medications were not administered in a customer friendly packaging, which was quite disappointing.  Giving a syringe for medication and then putting the medicine in a bottle makes for a difficult time of getting the medication into the syringe.  The syringe doesn't make it to the bottom and we ended up having to pour the medicine into the cap-which resulted in a full days loss of medication (spills,slops out of cap when closing back up)\nWhen I called to get follow up instructions, because NOTHING was provided when we picked up the medicine, we were given wrong info.  I was told to bring the fecal back in when in fact, we need to wait 10 full days to allow the medication to go full course.  Had we done this, the dog would have been medicated for parasites for 30 days straight.  This medication is meant to be given in spurts of time with breaks between.\nThe front desk staff, however nice, are not competent to handle pet care.  I do not trust this facility, I wouldn't refer anyone and will never go back!  Life is precious and not something to be taken lightly.  Medications can negatively react when mixed and they seem not to care!"
3,"Used the Yelp deal, and two lunch entrees and a sushi roll later we spent about $16 including tip, what a value. I am toying between a 3 and 4 star review but will give this place the benefit of the doubt until I try more dishes. \n\nThe inside is nothing special, a little on the dumpier side with outlet faces dangling out of the ceiling and bugs buzzing around.\n\nI ordered the chicken pad thai ($7.25) and a roll of the fire island (tuna, avocado in tempura style, served /sriracha, masago and scallion $8.25). The service was extremely fast, helpful and attentive.\n\nAs I expected, the pad thai was a little sweeter than a traditional thai pad thai and didn't have the peanut sauce based taste. Regardless, it was pretty good and I between the shared sushi and noodles I had plenty of leftovers.\n\nThe sushi was decent, was looking for a little more heat from the sriracha as the server indicated the roll should have a little kick to it. Could have used a little more tuna, but overall I was impressed.\n\nAnother bonus for this place... they deliver! Minimum is $15 and I believe radius is within 3 miles. Ginbu just might have become my new Sunday night recovery go-to."
2,"My husband and I got married here last Sunday. For the most part it was pretty ok. For the price ($400 - can't really beat that for a wedding venue), we can't complain too much. The limo arrived on time and got us there about 20 minutes before the ceremony. I was able to slip on my dress and I was ready to go. As I was standing by the door, ready to start my walk though, I could hear the minister Phil yelling at my guests to get out of the way and sit down. I'll be honest, he was kind of an asshole. My Uncle was only walking to his seat but was rudely scolded by him for it. I must say (sarcastically) that seeing that on my wedding video was great.\n\nWe had a Garden Terrace ceremony and I must say that looks can be deceiving. The pictures online don't give you an accurate idea of how small that area really is. We had a small ceremony there, so it ended up working, but any more people and it would have been an uncomfortable fit. \n\nWe didn't have too many hiccups and to be honest, I was more into the whole \""committing myself to my new husband\"" thing than being concerned with what was going on around me.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad and I was happy with our day. The photographer on site (Kay) said she was really backed up with photos, so we should hopefully get them in 3-4 weeks. Fingers crossed."
3,"I liked this place before they changed their name. It is basically the same. Delicious aloo naan. Good vegetarian options. Very large menu. Always deserted at dinner time. \n\nThis was my third snow-storm trip to Madison and we wanted to dine at Taste of India. This time our service was polite and attentive. Of course, we had the place to ourselves. But the server was pleasant and quick with the refills. \n\nThe food: overall good flavors. Small dishes for the price, though. Our bill was about $50 for two lassi (drinks), one order of aloo naan ($2.95), and two masala dishes (lamb and vegetable). There wasn't really enough to take home from either of our dishes, and they could have been more generous with the vegetables. But the flavors were there.\n\nOverall a good place and would recommend."
3,"Located on the ground floor of the California Hotel and a fast & easy place to get great food.\n\nHawaiian style plate lunches around 6 to 8 bucks.  Teri beef is my usual go-to.  They also serve bento, katsu and even Zippy's chili.\n\nIf you have a Boyd player's club card (and have points on it) you can pay for your meal with it.\n\nAll in all a nice spot to drop in on.. never had a long line yet and always had a table.  Go get um!"
2,"Although this is my most recent time staying here, I've stayed in the past quite a bit for work, sometimes weeks on end. For work, I liked it the most. It was central enough. The Path system took me underground and straight to the office building above Ailes. The rooms are modern, contemporary and has lots of amenities. I've stayed before in Fairmont (connects underground, but old rooms), Delta (doesn't connect to anything), and this one is by far my favourite. \n\nIt's also about 10 mins walk to the Old City!\n\nI'm back here again as they host an annual dance competition. They are well versed in the dance world as they do this twice every year, for at least 5+ years. \n\nI actually don't mind that it's all one level, except for a few stairs. You can get around quicker and no need to wait for elevators (except the ones to get up). \n\nThe restaurants aren't anything to be had though. I've eaten in the bar (meh), and le Castillion (expensive). Nearby, in the path, you can grab a quick bite to eat in the food courts or in the train station. For a better dinner, take the path thru Place Ville Marie to St Catherines. \n\nThere's free wifi, but it's deceiving. I guess they are getting with the times, and in a transition phase. The rooms say only wired internet is free, and when you get to the splash page, you can't really do anything unless you pay. \nWell, turns out, if you click \""bill my room\"", and there is a $0.00 options. More speed, you have to pay more. I guess it's tricky, and hopefully they will make it more clear. \n\nThe staff here are super friendly. Everyone's smiling and seems like they will do their best to serve you better. Never had an issue. \n\nThe Castillon restaurant, has not so bad food, except the terrible service, waiting in line and lack of staff makes it unbearable. \n\nRegardless, if I had to pick a hotel in Montreal, I would choose this one."
0,"YUCK!!!! Do not stay in this dump. Lets start off by saying they only got 1 star because I had to leave one. First thing first the girl at the front desk hates life is the impression we received. Then we went to the room after getting lost trying to find it, yea that's right good luck trying to find your room through the moldy smelling halls. Then we got there oh my gosh!!! It was gross, the sheets were dirty, there was fecal matter in the toilet, the sink had standing dirty water in it because it couldn't drain,oh and there was trash on the floor?!!! Wtf? So I went to the front desk to talk to the manager and was told no manager was on duty but the Owner was here so they called the owner and she told them she didn't have time to deal with me! So i checked out and checked in to the Clarion that is connected to it. And it is owned by the same people but better rooms, beds, and smells better. There was a lady at the Clarion front desk that was checking in also that checked out of the Ramada after going in her \""clean room\"" and finding dirty wet underwear on the floor! THE RAMADA IS A DISEASE INFESTED MOTEL DO NOT STAY THERE!!!!"
3,"Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty."
4,"This place is a quality establishment! The customer service is wonderful and JESLIE is always a pleasure to deal with and always has a smile on her face. I am so glad I found my home, finally!!!This is a must see high end luxury urban living condo !  EDDY H"
0,"I am actually writing this review having gotten off the plane after travelling for 12 hours (when the flight should've been more than half that time) on my first and only encounter with Spirit Airlines. I totally regret not having read the reviews before booking my flight - cheap fares are definitely too good to be true with this airline.\n\nEmbarked on a flight from Las Vegas to La Guardia (NYC) airport, via stopover in Detroit.\n\nFound out a few hours before my flight departed that there was a charge for carry-on and check-in luggage - $100 at the gate if you don't buy it beforehand! Daylight robbery. So I paid $40 for my carry-on, but when I arrived at the airport asked if this could be refunded as my luggage fit inside the 'test' compartment at check-in. The service attendant basically waved me away and told me I'd have to pay as it was 'outside the dimensions'. Whatever. \n\nDeparture time was 8.12am. After arriving at the airport 2 hours before the flight departure time, and upon arrival at the gate we were told that the flight was potentially overbooked and that they were seeking volunteers to take a later flight. This was the first scare. However the flight ended up departing approximately on time. Too good to be true? Read on.\n\nArrived in Detroit for a 'brief' stopover. Original time of departure was meant to be 4pm. Passengers were told nothing and it was only until I checked the departure screen that there was now a 2 hour delay, scheduled for 6pm! Went back to the lounge and then was told that the flight would be departing at 5.15pm - no reason was given for the delay.\n\nAll passengers boarded for an anticipated 5.15pm departure. It was only when we were all seated and waiting in the tarmac that the captain decided to tell us that La Guardia airport was closed due to bad weather in NYC. Funny though, that a fellow passenger called out that her friend was departing on a Delta plane at the same time and on the same flight leg, yet her flight was not delayed? The attendant did not seem to know how to respond to this. She called the captain and the captain's best line was that the weather was bad and was causing delays everywhere. Not sure if this was true but after reading MANY negative reviews about Spirit on Yelp, it seems that this is not the first time they have acted dishonestly and used the weather as an excuse for their sloppy practices.\n\nTo top this off, we were then told we could not disembark the plane (since we didn't know if our flight would actually depart due to the so-called weather problems in NYC) and if we chose to do so, would not be able to re-board! The attendant also let us know that Spirit would not be giving out free snacks or water for the delay, and that they would have to 'seek permission from the company first.' What the hell!? This was now beyond a joke. In my entire experience of flying, I have never encountered such unprofessional level of service by an airline. I don't understand how this company is still in business! \n\nAfter waiting on the tarmac, we finally found out at 6.30pm we were able to fly. We landed in NYC at 8.15pm, nearly 3 hours later than the original arrival time of 5.45pm. \n\nIf we really want to stop this airline running altogether, I'd suggest lodging a complain with DOT. I even Googled it and there's an actual website on how to shut down Spirit Airlines!! Check here: http://www.spiritairlinesfacts.com/how-to-shut-down-spirit.html\n\nNever flying this airline again!"
0,"I have been going to Corleone's for a few months now because I wanted to try several things on the menu before I judge the place. Being a fan of Philly Steaks I thought this place would be good by the classic look of the place. \n\nI got the tuesday night special where if you get 1 large sub for 10 bucks (without a drink of fries) you get a small one for free. It was interesting because I saw a lot of people order a large sub, and they weren't notified of the daily special. So I ordered the regular philly steak with a small hoagie.  He asked me if I wanted mushrooms or peppers on my philly steak, and i said yes, and I didint know that was an extra charge. \n\n\nThe Philly Steak was mediocre at best. They use low quality meat, and overcook it. The bread could be a lot better.  The guy suggested I put oil and vinger on the small hoagie I got, and I know why because it sucked! Covering it with tons of oil and vinegar is not gonna do the job if it's bad to begin with.\n\nThe only thing good here is the pizza and the fries. Stay away from everything else as it's also overpriced! $13 bucks for a philly steak combo? are you kidding me? Tell people about your specials, and stop penny pinching people for extra money. Tell me if peppers and mushrooms will be an extra charge. \n\n\nIn my opinion if you are gonna eat this bad for this price it might as well be good!"
0,"This location is just ok- went there today to get some body shop camomile makeup remover but they have no BS stock at all..the cashier at front has no personality and was clearly struggling with making change during checkout. No one greeted or offered to help me in locating products, seems like hardly any staff at all at the store. I don't think I'm coming back to this location due to this experience, there are many more locations with better, vibrant knowledgeable staff."
3,"I am a fan. We've definitely gotten a few dishes we didn't care for (we being the man and I), but sometimes thats just how it goes. Overall, the good dishes have far outweighed the bad.\n\nKILLER happy hour. They've changed it 3x in 2 years which can be a bit annoying, but every single thing we've ever ordered off the $3 happy hour menu has been thoroughly enjoyed. Tasty beers, the man loves their raptor red. \n\nAmazing veggie burgers, and I am not even a vegetarian! This is probably one of my favorite things on their menu. The only thing they don't do well is pizza..... but other than that I love this place, which is different for me as I am not a fan of chains generally."
3,"It's super-cute fashion at totally affordable prices. If you like Forever 21 and Charlotte Russe, you'll really like Hottie. While the first thing you'll notice is the club gear, and it's great club gear, continue browsing and you'll also find stylish pieces to wear in the office. Like the aforementioned retailers, the styles at Hottie are very trendy (think Juniors) and the sizes only accommodate up to a size 12, at most. But, those young enough (or young-looking enough) and small enough to shop at Hottie will thoroughly appreciate the opportunity to add trend-setting fashion to their wardrobe without breaking their budget.\n\nThere are actually four Hottie locations in Las Vegas: Grand Canyon Target Center, Maryland Parkway, Silverado Ranch and Boca Park."
2,Slow. The store wasn't even that busy. My sandwich took 15 minutes to be ready. I can make a sandwich faster at home. One of the workers wasn't very friendly and the other one was deaf. The focaccia bread here is a little underwhelming. Wildflower bread Company has the best I've ever tasted. Maybe they set the bar too high. The roast beef on the sandwich was good so at least they have that going for them. I don't think they need to cake on the mayonnaise on the sandwich but they did. Don't people come here to eat healthy? They do have the best cookies I've ever tasted in my life though. You have to try the snickerdoodle and the gingerbread cookies.
1,"I've been a Wal-mart goer since I was young and generally have always had a good experience there.  Today I went to go buy something that was miss priced when I picked it up and I didn't find out until I went through the check out line.  The cashiers usually recognize that and give it to you at the price it was labeled.  Today the cashier, Dot, could care less and was just rushing me to get through her line.  I looked back after I was done and she was gone like a lighting bolt.  I'm not all that impressed with the customer service at this store so far"
4,"Me and my husband love this village inn. We go here at least once a week for their honey mustard pita club, there is nothing like it. The service here is awesome. We have never had a problem. We also get a pie to go and some times go just to get a home made pie. The sugar free apple pie and French silk are delicious. I would recommend this village inn location to anyone."
0,"The teenagers working here are not capable of handling any complaints. I asked for no onions on an Italian club and instead they put no sauce. I brought it back and all they said is we can pick off the onions for you.. No I don't want you digging through my sandwich with your hands. Just make me a new sandwich how I ordered it. Can't believe how bad their customer service is, the lady behind me ordered a club lulu and they gave her a club tuna and said that's what she ordered. The kids working here need to develop customer service skills or they need a manager here that actually cares about guest concerns. Neither of us got comped anything not even a soda. Instead all we got are eye rolls for something that was their fault. Maybe if they turned down their horrible music they could hear the orders correctly."
4,Stopped in for tennpenyaki and  really enjoyed the place. Our chef George was very entertaining and interactive. George was not Japanese but did a great job on the food. I have been to alot of place for tennpenyaki and for sure this will be my stop again when I an in town. Thank you. Jumbo Jack
1,"On our drive to Tucson (yes, we took the long way.. more scenic) we stopped by.. it was the only place en-route that seemed to have consistently decent reviews.  The place is easily found, clean and is well staffed with nice folks.\nI had the cashew chicken and was a bit put off when it showed up with corn in it.. it seemed like an obvious \""filler\""... oh well, I guess.\nThe flavor was meh... i think it was missing garlic, ginger.. tastes that engage your senses.. this did not engage anything.\nAt least we gave it a shot!"
2,"I guess I'm not the target audience for this place. I'm not into buffets at all, it just doesn't intrigue me. Came here for dinner in September for the one year anniversary celebration. At $40+ each person, I was expecting a little more than what I experienced. Thankfully, we also were abe to go straight in and skipped the line as well, which would be another $20 if we actually had to pay for this.\n\nI started at one end of the buffet and sampled a little bit of each. Out of all the stations, Italian, Mexican, Asian, carving station and dessert area, the only place I enjoyed was the charcuterie. I found myself going back for more cheese and honey, than anything else. \n \nGuess if buffets are your thing, this could peak your interest."
0,"Very odd admissions policy. Stood in line forever, willing to pay whatever and didn't get in. I think they don't like money."
0,"Horrible experience.\n\nWe ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken.\n\nThe Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.\n\nWe told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.\n\nNo Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab. \n\nBad customer service as far as I'm concerned. \n\nTip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills"
3,I'm a huge fan of this place! The drinks run a little steep but the atmosphere is great. The one thing is they don't really have a dance floor so try and get invited to a table!
3,"Fantastic food, and relaxed and stylish atmosphere. Great service. Ever since I first ate food by Roy Yamaguchi I've been a fan. Excellent cocktails too. This is a great place for a special occasion.\n\nThey have a dedicated gluten-free menu too, which even includes a flourless chocolate desert, which I've heard is amazing."
3,"Best. Indian. Lunch. Buffet. In. Charlotte. So far.\n\nFirst off, f- all your reviews about rude Indian waiters. If you've been to India, you know what may come with the territory... heeheehee... Who doesn't love hole in the walls? I would only moan about the cleanliness depending on whether or not the food was good. And in this case, I don't complain.\n\nThere is also nothing that makes me happier then coming here and seeing 80% Indians eating lunch. If this is where all the Indians go, you know it's gotta be good. Dipping fluffy nan bread with their right hands into steaming hot curry.\n\nI haven't tried anything but the lunch buffet, but I think it's incredible value. Everything is done properly, the rotis, idlys, the chana masala, the chicken curries, the raita, etc. There's usually 2 meat curries and 4 veg curries to choose from. Fresh salad (cucumbers to plonk into the raita) and fresh fruit for dessert.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, know that this isn't gourmet Indian or out-of-the-box Indian. It's just plain average mama's Indian. Which to me, is perfect for a quick lunch. It's also tons better then overpriced Indian, or sad discolored Indian food. Like the Saag Paneer ain't the best you've tasted. But it's satisfying.\n\nPrices:\n\n    Lunch Buffet $6.99\n    Weekend Brunch Buffet $9.99\n\nMe happy. If you want a un-American eating experience, eat here.

4,"I visited this quaint Thai restaurant as a last stop before departing Las Vegas this past weekend after searching local Thai restaurants. Their websites all had beautiful pictures of its many food items and I must admit I was hesitant at first to take any of the pictures seriously. Though I must say I was overly satisfied with everything this establishment had to offer.\n\nMost Thai restaurants in Las Vegas have beautiful d\u00e9cor which is always a pleasant sight when enjoying one's meal, and this restaurant was no exception. The restaurant was also connected to a Huka lounge and by the looks of it they play live music on certain nights.\n\nAs for the food it was decently priced, especially when you consider the marvelous food presentation, and exceptional natural taste of the foods. It felt and tasted as if every ingredient was naturally produced! Every item we ordered not only looked beautiful, but tasted just as great if not better. If you ever wanted a superb tasting strawberry lemonade, well try theirs you wont regret it!\n\nI don't quite remember my servers name but she was very sweet and so were the rest of the servers. It was also great to get a good night greeting from a man who i believe was the owner. Two thumbs up for that. It's been a long while since I've last been to a restaurant where I can honestly say I was already making plans in my head as to when I'd be returning. But Satay Thai managed that and more."
4,I love this Jack in the Box restaurant because it's not so busy all the time. They have polite employees & quick customer service.. It's also  very clean
4,Our favorite Mexican place around!!!
1,"I'm not one to write a bad review at all, but I expect excellence when I pay something. I have been trying to get an item served for over a month and John stated that he went to the apartment about 7 times, but never was able to get ahold of the defendant. I hired another process server and he promptly delivered the service I requested in a day. Seems kind of fishy to me. Seemingly great guy, but if you want someone who gets things done I would look for someone else."
3,"Greenland Supermarket is really the only Korean market in Las Vegas that has legit fresh products. I was reading up on other peoples review for this place and the reason why my mom and I go shopping here every week is the variety and freshness of meats & fish they have here. GS reminds me of the Korean markets in LA and in Korea. They have a plethora of different types of rice cakes, fish cakes, meats, ramen, sauces, banchan, dry goods, snacks, etc. and this is the only Korean market where they actually pay attention to the expiration dates of the products! The meats are good quality and you will not regret purchasing any marinated meat and the pork belly. My favorite 'togo' meal they have is near the banchan isle and its an assortment of fish eggs bibimbap style. It has chunks of sashimi with lettuce, daikon, carrots, and hot pepper paste. Mmmm yummy! Before you enter the market they have a list of specials that you should take advantage of, especially the dumplings and cold buckwheat noodle soups. \n\nLast but not least, the GS foodcourt. My mom and I usually stop by Baek-ni-Han (corner store towards your right). The owner is a man with glasses and he makes everything from scratch. If you like soups and noodles, try getting the half seafood soup with cha-chang myeun. The bowl actually has a divider so you can have a bit of each. Spiciness of the seafood soup compliments so well with the soy-sauce/ heartiness of the black bean noodles. What a great day to end your shopping trip before you head home and a one stop shop for Korean cooking headquarters!"
2,I had lunch buffet here . I went quite late so can't really complain about the food availability in the buffet . Taste of food was  not great but average like every other indian restaurant . but their veggie dum biryani is really awesome ... Staff was very polite and kind . Ambience was also good..\n\nMay be I  ll try this place again for dinner but not for buffet ..
1,"Baked cod was pretty good. But the service was terrible.  Neither the host or the server knew what the happy hour special was. And when we finally found out, it was pretty weak.....$0.50 off rails and domestic taps. Boring!!!  Looks like a fun place to watch a have if you can't watch it at home. But we will never go there again."
3,"I love love LOVE this place. I've been a frequent customer here for a little over 2 yrs. Shrimp is always so plump and sauces are amazing. My favorites here are, kung pao shrimp, vegetable soup, and vegetable shrimp. The lo mein is also top notch :)"
1,"The steaks were great - we had filet mignon and ribeye - well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  That said, the steak tartare lacked any flavor and the signature lobster gnocchi side was really overcooked and heavy.  The smores cake tasted liked a chain restaurant dessert.\n\nBut the entire experience was ruined by the duo singing/playing in the bar.  The noise level was extreme throughout the restaurant-  a woman at the next table was literally yelling to be heard and so we were (unfortunately) privvy to her entire conversation.  We could not relax and enjoy our own conversation, and the band very bad so it was not even a pleasure to listen."
2,"Nothing special here. Only stopped inside because Mexican place had closed down already next door. The sliced Chicken breast wrap was average, good in a pinch, but nothing I would ever go out of my way for. It had semi sliced chicken heated with salsa, some cheese, onions and lettuce. Wheat wrap was healthier, but at 7 bucks it was a bit overpriced. Not much else, except they have a nice patio out back to enjoy the winter sunshine."
1,"You know it's perfectly credible to shop in places like Primark? The same attitude is not extended to Shoe Zone.\n\nI'm all one for finding a bargain. But this is a bargain bin. Their \""funky canvas\"" shoes are lurid, likely made of cardboard, and modelled by junkies. It's so cheap it's depressing, and it's almost impossible to talk about Shoe Zone without a bit of commentary on the state of society/politics or the pock marked, post recession high street.\n\nIf you end up in such a bad way that you have to shop in here, then I would advise you do anything you possibly can to get yourself back up on your feet. The shoes in here will ruin your tootsies and wreak havoc to your street cred. Sole destroying."
4,"This is my favorite yoga studio of all times. I went to several classes a week while I was living in Madison for the summer. This was a few years ago but I still remember it clearly because that's how much I love this place!\n\nI forgot my teacher's name but she was pure awesome. The class was challenging...actually it was really challenging...but that's what I love about it. We did kirtan before every class, which really helped us to relax and be present for our practice.  I suggest going to this place and then eating at the weary traveler (after a shower of cause)."
4,"Why did they close the Charleston location?? The butterfish is the most delicious thing on the menu, but everything is great right down to the cocktails."
4,"Called Ron, gave me a price of $59 to Auger my clogged toilets at my shop, Beck Racing Engine. Said he'd be right over and in 40 minutes he was! He said he could not guarantee results but was able to clear all three and they are now working great!Ron , Thanks again for your prompt & courteous service!"
3,"This is a place that you must bring an out of town guest to, and if you really want to be creative with how to propose marriage this would be a good place to, heck it's good for any occasions other than break-ups and affair confessions. \n\nIt's a throwback to the 50s soda parlor, it's so old school, and quite cute! Everything's pink, that it almost feels like Barbie is the owner of the store and she just wanted everyone to know pink is the color of the ultimate diva! Their's a soda bar and booths, and tables and chairs, and it's a great family friendly atmosphere. During the days it attracts families and in the evening, couples, teens, and kids at heart! I like their changing flavors of the month board where you can take out either a pint of quart of their hand packed ice cream!\n\nThey offer shakes, floats, splits, and cones/bowls of ice cream! love it! And during the day there's also a food menu limited to sandwiches. One thing you'll notice when seated are the many frames of Family Circle comics. Bil Keane the comic strip writer is a big fan of Sugar Bowl and alot of his comics mention the place, so it's pretty cool a comic strip celebrates the awesomeness of this old town landmark. \n\nThese are my favorites, the top hat sundae, the buster brownie, the Desireme (D-Sire-Me) Banana Split and the 23 skiddoo!! Love them all and if I have no plans to go out, I'm willing to trek out from my place in Chandler to Old Town to pick up some ice cream and some quarts to go! It's laid back and chill... hence I've come back ever since I first went here back in 2005. Oh and the proposal thing happened to a friend of mine, her husband proposed to her at one of the booths... I think it was the 23 skiddoo!!"
3,"If you want a quick lunch, healthy or filled with calories, this is the place for you.  Their food is always fresh, try the new pork tenderloin sandwiches.  Super tasty and healthier than some of the other meats.  The staff is always friendly and most of them recognize me after only a handful of visits.  The soups are great too and they have a larger variety than most sandwich shops including chile and chicken pot pie soup.  \n\nThey have a salad bar with fresh ingredients and even give free muffins and crunchy garlic toast out free to all customers.  The soft serve ice cream is also included in your meal if you dine in.  \n\nThe price is reasonable and the portions are just right. Goldilocks would be pleased. not to big, not to small."
3,"The Cavatelli pasta might have been the best pasta I ever had. A 10 out of 10. The service was friendly, professional and efficient. My only complaint I had was with the wine list. Terrific wines, but marked up at least 3 times retail.  Also, other than about 5% of the list, bottles of red were $150 and up. Are you kidding me?"
0,"The plastic in my pulled pork, overly dry hamburger for my daughter. The service was just nothing to write anything nice about.  I would suggest in the future if you like your food and wait staff sub par.  Too much to ask? \n\nI suggest if you serve plastic in the food maybe the manager could apologize, maybe even take that off the bill.  I'm still wondering where plastic would come from?"
3,"Fun little place to grab a drink during a shopping break.  Welcome addition to the Biltmore.  The bartender was friendly, it has the intimate feel which is a nice balance to the cavernous Phoenix restaurants.  I haven't sampled the food, but was impressed by the wine list.  We were there on a rainy day, but can't wait to go back when we can sit outside."
3,Great decor.  Food very good.
3,Very good Mediterranean fare. Very flavorful and authentic. A small family run spot that clearly cares about quality. Worth a stop.
4,"If you want to see a comedy magic show on a budget while in Las Vegas, this is a great show to see. The quality is phenomenal for the price. $30 got the wife and I in the very front row at The Flamingo Theater where several folks right around us got pulled into the act. \n\nThe quality of the illusions was great and what really added even more value to the show was the two guests Nathan brought in from other shows. Not only did it break up the routine of trick after trick, it added some tremendous comical moments to the show, one of which had most everybody about peeing their pants with laughter.\n\nIt was so good, I'll probably see it again on our next trip to Vegas, even if it is the same. Nathan Burton Comedy Magic Show - highly recommended."
0,"The Food and Service was HORRIBLE. The pepole sitting next to us found HAIR IN THEIR FOOD and we saw a cockroach on one of the tables! One of their dishes tasted so NASTY and SALTY. \nWhen i asked them to take away the dish, they laughed at me. \nI only tasted it and they still forced me to pay. \nI was outraged! Then they made a huge scene embarrassing me stating that I had bad taste! \nCan you believe that? \nNot only that... for 3 people, they expected us to pay 70 bux! to take their crap?? NO THANK YOU!"
2,"I would not go out of my way to shop here.  This little shop is located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino.  It is very convenient to stop in here only when you're at the South Point.\n\nThey carry just about everything you need.  The prices aren't too bad either.  Not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either.  Everytime we stay at the South Point, we will stop by here for something.\n\nIf you're a hotel guest, and they give you a savings book.  Make sure you stop in here to claim a little souvenir from the gift shop.  The last couple of times they've given a useful key chain with the South Point name on it."
3,"Following in the footsteps of Oxfam, childrens charity Barnados have established a series of charity shops specialising in books and music. As all of the stock is donated, there can be a surplus amount of bad celebrity biographies, true crime, chick lit and real life stories. If you look beyond these however, there's usually some gems to be found. \n\nThe last time I visited I found copies of novels by Zadie Smith, Lorrie Moore, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Joshilyn Jackson nestled between emerging and award winning writers. All were priced \u00a32-\u00a32.50 and in very good to excellent condition. I also spotted some pretty good baking and cookbooks in the food and drink section including the Wagamama and Green and Black cookbooks. Both were marked down to a fiver and the latter was packed with mouthwatering recipes for gooey chocolate brownies, cakes and cookies."
2,I can't comment on anything except for the returns/exchanges department. We went to return a part for a fridge that we ordered online and there was quite a long line by the customer service department (it was lunchtime). They could have brought a few more personnel over to help. The return itself was pretty pain-free - he scanned the item and returned the funds to my credit card.
0,Poor customer support. Very slow response time. I'm still waiting for my business cards I've ordered over a month ago!
4,"If I could give 10 stars I would!!!\n   We came home on memorial day to find one of our dogs Angel, had been mauled by another. The inside of the house looked like a murder scene. As my wife tended to our dog I jumped on line and found VCA. We Rushed our dog to their facility. They came outside with a gurney and brought us right in. They quickly took angel back and gave her meds to make her comfortable. They explained the process and gave us an estimate to have our dog stabilized. They said once they get more info as to the severity of her wounds they would contact us. \n   Angel ended up staying at the hospital for 3 days. She had hundreds of stitches, 5 drains inserted, crazy infection, but no broken bones. The worst injury was on her neck. It was opened up bigger than a football and she had bad pocketing. This is when VCA showed their true colors. We had just spent quite a bit of money for the initial surgery. We were given estimates of future charges and we just couldn't afford to do a whole lot more. We got approved for financing right in their office. We then told the doctor we had only so much more money we could afford and he told us he would work with in our budget. He understood the situation and what we had been through. \n   DR. Lenius is an absolute blessing. He was honest through the entire situation. He was understanding to our financial situation and he made every effort to take that into consideration when making suggestions for treatment. We have had 15-20 follow-up visits with Dr Lenius and each time he is considerate, caring, honest, and always pleasant. We will be there again this week and I am certain he will be exactly the same. \n   I wanted to mention 2 other people in their office. Charlotte is one of the vet assistants. No one makes our dog more excited than she does. She shows our girl nothing but love. It is tough to get our dog to leave once she has seen Charlotte. She is just an amazing individual with a vibrant personality that is contagious. Thank you Charlotte for being so kind and loving toward our dog. \n   Sarah works the front desk. We have spent lots of time with her during our visits waiting for Angel to be treated. Sarah is smiling every time we show up and welcomes us and Angel the second we come through the door. She makes small talk with us to help pass the time by. Sarah is an asset to the front desk of VCA. \n   Every visit to VCA is consistently exceptional. They make us feel like family and that is why we will return just to say hi. If we are every in need of a vet or know anyone else  that is, we will forever recommend Dr Lenius, Charlotte, and Sarah at the Country Club VCA. THEY ARE SECOND TO NONE!!!!\nThank You!,\nMike"
1,The service was fast and the waitress was nice. Don't drink the water. It's horrible. The food was just so so. We won't go here again!
3,"So fantastic! The salsa bar alone is worth going to see, unique tasty salsas. The tacos are big not street tacos, found out after I ordered 5 of them, but had plenty of take homes. Their horchata is the best I've ever had. The place it's self is small so make sure you get there before the rush. But absolutely check it out!"
2,"Don't get me wrong this place was yummy, but I ordered the special there, five cheeses on a burger, and my chest hurt.  It's really my fault.  It was just too much.  My husband had the toadstool which was to die for.  Have to love mushrooms that's all I have to say.  They were perfectly seasoned and I'm still drooling over it, and the cheese curds were absolutely delicious. The service was superb, she really wanted to help out as much as possible.  The bartender was really too accommodating, I wanted a shake with liquor.  They had the liquor, they had the shakes.  I was willing to pay.  It was a new form of lazy.  I actually felt bad for my server, because she was the messenger.  On a positive note, my husband got an awesome microbrew that he loved.  I'm sorry I can't remember the name, magic hat? Something in that sense.  All in all a-ok, try it out!"
0,"If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have.\n\nThe food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \""going to need a high chair for that?\"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable."
0,Boba here is disgusting. Vegas got nothing compared to California's Lollicup.. Or any boba places for that matter. Vegas needs to step their boba game up.
2,"First night of a birthday weekend of 4 and we stopped here.  It's a nice bar/ lounge that has a moderate dance floor size. Can get a little crowded at times but its fair.  The drinks are, well typical Vegas price. The music seemed mostly of house/ top 40 but they did switch it up with some hip hop from time to time.  The nice part is that you can walk in and out as long as you have yout stamp on your wrist from the first time you check in the front, which is perfect for smoking. Can't say much than that other than the venue is pretty nice and I wouldn't mind coming back."
0,After planning a month ahead of time we show up to have none of the reservation requests we had made met. They gave away our adjoining room and put us on different floors - we were traveling with young children and multiple families and had been assured these needs would be met. We needed extra blankets and there were none. Some of the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned and one had zero toilet paper in the bathroom when we checked in. Rooms weren't even ready until after 4:30! Also there's no breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel as there are plenty of other nicer hotels in this area. We went with cheapest which matches the service we received!
1,"We moved to this area a little over 1 month ago and have been exploring our options. We wound up in this area and decided to try this out.\n\nWhen entering the hostess lady looked incredibly bored and without a word guided us to our table, where she whispered that our server will be by shortly. About 5 minutes later the server came by and took our drink order, he came back with our drinks then disappeared for what seemed like 10-15 minutes. In that time we had been ready to order so what the heck?? And we were perhaps 1 of 5 other groups in here so it wasn't busy.\n\nI had ordered spicy tuna and hot and sour soup. Who I was with order a steak with tempura and fried rice. One good thing about here is that if someone you're with doesn't like Asian style food then things like steak are available (this wasn't hibachi or anything, it was just a regular steak...although it was mentioned that it had a spice that couldn't be determined).\n\nThe spicy tuna roll wasn't all that great. I've been to less impressive looking places and have had amazing spicy tuna rolls for less. It was like they weren't really trying. The hot and sour soup was ok but overloaded with carrots. I tasted the steak it was decent.\n\nIt took a long time to get a refill on our drinks.\n\nIt took even longer for them to come by and hand us the check.\n\nHave fun waiting if you go!"
4,"Went in there to get a couple of Jamba Juices, and I had taken the lid off mine and put it back on, I thought anyway.  And of course When I picked it up to go, I dropped the whole damn thing on the floor, counter, chairs, etc.  It went EVERYWHERE!  I wiped up what I could, and the people who worked there made me another one for free.  They were very tasty, icy and refreshing, and the service is top notch.   Five stars for this Jamba Juice, thank you!"
1,"I love this restaurants food and was super excited about their delivery option. It's been two hours and my food still hasn't arrived and we've called twice! Dine in is ok, but avoid delivery!"
0,"I recommended this place to a friend of mine visiting from Australia, given it's convenient location to my house.  It was probably the worst recommendation I've ever made.  First, check in was late.  No apology, just an \""Oh, your room isn't ready but should be in a few hours\"" - this at after 4PM.  Second, they double charged him for his room - ie, they hard charged the entire stay in advance, and then \""authorized\"" the entire amount + incidentals  yet again (he was staying in a suite for eight days, so we're not talking chump change).  When it was pointed out, not only did the front desk not acknowledge the mistake, but proceeded to argue with him for three days, even though he showed bank verification of the double posting.  After three days of continuous hassle, and three days when several thousand dollars was no longer easily available for other events, they finally acknowledged and corrected their mistake, but failed to apologize or even offer any sort of compensation.  Third, room service ~ basically don't order anything but the fresh fruit, and don't make /any/ special requests, because you'll be ignored.\n\nSeriously, don't do what I did, do NOT EVER recommend this as a decent place to stay that's \""off Strip\"", because frankly, I've seen better front desk customer service at a Hawthorne Inn."
1,"The only time I visit the Cheesecake factory is for lunch. Normally this place gets very crowded and you have to wait for a table.\nI love the warm brown seed bread they serve with their meals. The lunch time portions are almost as large as the dinner portions but is quite filling.\nYou do have to pay for parking but if you park in the garage they will validate you for $2.00 off your ticket.\nAs far as the cheesecake goes, it's fair. I have had genuine NY cheesecake that lays on my stomach. This type is ok but not what I am used to.\nI normally will visit when family and friends want to go there but it isn't a place I would choose for myself."
3,"we meet again, red velvet pancakes!\n\nmore open space and seats available; less crowded than the other location. friendly staff and new specials on the menu. ordered the spam scramble - scrambled eggs with diced spam sprinkled with sesame and seaweed seasoning, served with rice and macaroni salad. i love breakfast and although it might be simple, it's very comforting. i'm use to eating spam, eggs, and rice as a kid. also ordered red velvet pancakes on the side and it comes with cream cheese syrup. yes, i said it - cream cheese syrup! will definitely come back again and try other things on the menu (especially the other types of pancakes)! check out the picture i posted."
3,Great 50's style diner.  My wife and I go here at least twice a week.  We really like the salad bar and their breakfasts are awesome. My 2 favorite things to get are the corned beef hash skillet and the country fried steak and eggs.  The best thing I found here is that you get a lot of food for the money. I don't know many places where you can walk out stuffed to the gills (2 people) for under 20 bucks.
1,All I have to say is that they have a very very small sandwhich selection at the deli.  Kinda unusual given that the deli itself is good sized.
4,"I just love it when I can ask a million game-player geek questions and get some quality feedback from fellow 'geeks' haha.  But seriously, the service was excellent, and the trade in ratio to in-store credit was fare.  The store was clean, easy to navigate, and the customer service was outstanding!\n\nSo often I find myself buying games I play once or twice and then they collect dust.  Here, I was able to ask a dozen questions and narrow down some great game choices."
3,Red eye to NY.  Nice new leather seats..yay\n\nNo internet or tv on this flight....boooooooooo
2,"All three stars go to the ladies in charge of the bathrooms.  Charlotte has the best bathrooms - its official. Super clean, mints, perfume and a lovely welcome \""Hello welcome, welcome - all the rooms are clean.\""\nBoth food options I tried were awful - there was a sushi bar but it was 9 deep so no chance of a seat there.  Lots of rocking chairs for some reason but the biz folk looked very comfy in them with their puters and kindles."
2,"Such a lovely cosy place to sit in..\nFelt like walking into someone's living room..\nWould be even better if they actually light up their fireplace. .\n\nStumble across Nom de Plume..was kinda hungry..\nLooked at the menu ...yay..French Onion soup...on a windy night...yummy..\n\nWent inside.  Ordered the onion soup and a BLT roll..really wasn't expecting too much...\n\nOnion soup was delicious, rich in flavour but not heavy or overpowering, generous portion too..came with two slices of bread with butter..bread made by Manna House...no complaints...yummy...was nearly full when I finished the soup...it was very tasty.\n\nBLT. ..it was alright....I added another sachet of mayo..hehe..\n\nLovely quiet place..\nAlthough food isnt outstandingly good but will definitely be back, it's the atmosphere that makes the difference and the onion soup!!"
1,Went here on Saturday for dinner with a group of six of us. Service was so so and same with the food. Prices weren't bad and the interior is pretty 70s like?\n\nNo real complains but nothing to make me want to come back.
4,"Maybe not the world's most authentic Mexican food, but oh how I love Cantina Laredo.\n\nI go here every time I visit friends in Phoenix, and I've never had a bad meal here.  At dinner I'm partial to the camaron poblano asada.  The combination of steak, poblano pepper, and shrimp is fantastic, and I've never had meat cooked this perfectly before.  On my last visit for lunch I had the mole enchiladas, and they were excellent-- maybe not the best mole I've ever had, but heaven for this Mexican-food-starved-Seattleite.  They make the guacamole tableside and can make it as spicy as you want, which is nice.  Their chips are good as are both salsas, although I didn't really detect a difference in heat.  The beer selection is good, and I remember liking their margaritas as well.\n\nService is great (tableside guacamole!) and  the building itself is pretty.  Definitely a fan."
2,"We came here on an off night, an evening just to rest and relax after an all day affair at one of Mandalay Bay's beach cabana's. We both were in the mood for seafood; she chose the Sea Bass, I went with the Halibut.\n\nStarted w the Gyoza, which was the highlight.  The fish was good, with a nice, clean presentation (see pics) but have had better, both in texture and taste...it wasn't bad per se, but just not knock your socks off good (that would be what the food was at Sensi, two night later! Wow!!)"
2,"All I have to say is: What the heck Las Vegas?\n\nCashman Field is an okay place to catch a ball game. I highly recommended throwing down the very few extra dollars it will cost you to sit behind home plate. Unless of course you're really wanting to catch those foul balls. But seriously, 2 bucks for a decent seat instead of a bench is worth it.\n\nBut really Las Vegas? We can't upgrade our baseball stadium? It's just a bit bigger than a high school baseball stadium. Sure, it's okay, but why can't we do a little better? Las Vegas is a huge city - it deserves a better ballpark.\n\nOverall this is a good time. You must endure the families and the kiddies, but hey, it's a baseball game, so you have no choice. \n\nFood choices are meh and of course the prices are outrageous for what you're getting, but again, I digress - baseball game!\n\nFun times though and I enjoyed myself. I would be afraid to go when it starts hitting those 90+ temperatures though."
3,"Rock bottom prices for a hotel that's about a mile from the Strip. When we walked in, the room smelled strongly of bleach, which is fine since I'd rather have it smell more antiseptic than smelling like no one had done anything to the room. The room itself was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The hard wooden bedframes have sharp corners that are right at the shin/knee level which can cause some painful bruises if you are not careful of where you walk! \n\nThe bathroom was also spacious, with a shower, no tub. The shower itself has good water pressure, but the floor in our shower made a strange creaking noise whenever I moved.\n\nWe stayed for one night over the weekend and found the hotel to be quiet. We couldn't hear any of the other patrons which was nice (Although this might have been due to the fact that there weren't many patrons here in the hotel in general).\n\nBreakfast was decent. It included beverage such as apple and orange juice, milk, coffee, and tea. There were bagels, slices of bread, mini-muffins, fruity breakfast bars, bananas, and cereals. Food was refreshed fairly quickly once items ran out, and there was no problem finding a place to sit and eat.\n\nCheck-in and check-out was easy. Be aware that there is about a $9 facility fee which covers breakfast, wi-fi, exercise room, etc.\n\nIn general, while you're getting a deal by staying off the Strip, the hotel is a nondescript brown building with not a lot of good signage yet. The location is a bit less than ideal since it's bordering a more run-down part of town. There is a nice underground garage though.\n\nOne thing to note is that there isn't any fridge or microwave in the rooms, so plan accordingly."
2,"Stayed over the weekend for the first time and I was very, very surprised by how clean and nice the rooms were.  Despite being one of the older/oldest hotels on the strip, the rooms were very nicely remodeled.  I like that they had a TV embedded within the bathroom mirror.  I'm not sure how I feel about the florescent light bulbs right above my bed, but overall, I liked the theme of the room.  Kinda girly, but I like it!\n\nI wouldn't mind staying here again, especially since it's located near the center and has a beautiful view if you're overlooking the strip!"
1,"There doesn't seem to be anyone in charge of this event. My wife and I had a lovely time there Thursday evening, thanks to Willy Street Co-op.  We chatted up some nice people and saw several old friends.  When we returned home I realized I had misplaced my reading glasses (owned, repaired and maintained with new lenses, for the past eight years). I am now devastated as I can't see anything without them. I've returned to La Fete three times in the last two days: walking several blocks, fighting traffic and crowds, looking for parking, and trying to track down any official who could help me with lost and found, or offer any helpful information.  I've called the Marquette Neighborhood Association twice: no answer, no return call. I've talked to security, who inform me they're the last to know anything. Who is officiating this event?  I'm supposed to meet an old friend from Ohio there this evening (Saturday) but I no longer feel like going. If you have any information regarding my pair of metal-framed, prescription glasses, I can offer a reward of $25.00 for their return.  Please leave your contact information with Onya at Willy Street Co-op."
2,"On weekends this place is super delish! Fresh and tasty! I have come in during weekdays and been a bit disappointed.  I do not drive 3 hours to be disappointed! The baked good are wonderful, just get there early or they will sell out."
0,Have lived here for 15 years and have had great food and not so great food and will have to say that this is one of the worst buffets in this town. The general quality of the food was a zero; desserts were very well done and I am not a dessert person; service staff were excellent. Many selections were gone no matter how many attempts to see if they had been replenished. Standouts were the ribs and pork belly. \nHot sauce on a piece of watermelon not so gourmet !!!\nIt's not about the price; don't care about that; it's about the quality and this just doesn't have it.\nDo yourself a favor and go somewhere else !!!
0,"Yelp needs a zero star.  I've been to Caesars many times.  I will never stay there again or gamble a penny there.  I won't even walk in the door.  I paid for a room, which I didn't get.  We booked 4 days with an Augustus tower room.  They put us in an \""upgrade\"" in the Octavius tower.  The upgrade was krap, which is why the Augustus tower sells out before the Octavius tower.  Go for the cheapest room before the Octavius tower if you can't find a Motel 6...it's an upgrade.  We asked for our actual room after a night and they said no problem, real soon...we waited in our room until 4pm and they gave us the typical excuse that the current people stayed an extra day.  When have you ever changed your flights and spent an extra day...BS.  Needless to say we never received what we paid for, even after eating at Guy Savoy's.  The desk clerk said the manager would call and make it right.  Well two weeks later and not a word.  Liars, cheats, thieves...I own bonds on this company and it's no wonder why they're going down.  This company is going out of business, not because of the venue, but because they suck.  Ya, the odds in the casino are horrible too.  Never waste your money here.  I only have regrets.  I gave them a chance to make it right and they failed, I gave then another and they didn't even bother to call.  The restaurants are the worst on the strip.  How bad does it have to get before they just close up?"
2,"First of all the location is awesome . You have to actually take your time and see all the artwork posted around the building . You can even buy some artwork ! Awesome ! Now to the good stuff , my burger called the JIVE TURKEY . It was a really well seasoned and juicy turkey patty  . I deff had to put the works called everything . Which included lettuce , tomato , pickles and onions . They don't have combination plates so your sides are sold separate . I had waffle fries and I bought a side of house made tartar sauce . I enjoyed the tartar sauce , definitely a score . Service was great , not to mention he was cute .  The menu was executed well with quirky funky names ."
0,"My girlfriend took her Coach bag to this dry cleaners and when she got it back, it had a tear on the exterior that was as big as a quarter.  When confronted about the damage, the woman at the counter became very aggitated and refused to pay for the damage done to the bag.  I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and Celebrity Dry Cleaning did not respond to the BBB either.  I highly recommend choosing a different dry cleaner."
2,"For an AYCE sushi joint, this place delivers pretty well. Yes, they do offer Uni, and yes, it's obviously not as good as what you'd get at a traditional joint, but AYCE with an entire menu isn't bad at all. \n\nThe service was excellent. We had a big table (actually took up the entire Karaoke room. Yep, they've got one!) and there were two waitresses attentively serving us. \n\nThe tuna was fairly dry, but the yellowtail and salmon were both excellent in AYCE quality. It's Korean-owned, so they have some Korean plates to offer as well, on an AYCE basis. The one thing that stood out was the Duk bok gi. It was pretty damned good! I would come back here next time I'm around downtown, as it's the only tasty AYCE sushi place around..at least that I know of."
4,"I-Naba has been our weekend staple all summer long.  \n\nWe usually share the Chirashi Combination ($14) and have it with cold Udon.  I love their little chirashi - it's the perfect size for lunch and the price can't be beat.  The Husband usually eats up the udon on his own.  (I did once make the mistake of eating all the chirashi and udon myself and I was beyond full.)  Sometimes their chirashi can be such a pleasant surprise with scallops and the like.  Other times, it's filled with the standard tuna, salmon, and ikura.  I was actually disappointed that squid wrapped with shiso wasn't in my most recent order.\n\nSometimes we throw in a few of their other items:\n\n* Kakuni ($6) - Braise black pork belly, enough said.\n\n* Salmon Oshizushi ($7) - It's pressed cured salmon with salmon eggs.  The Little Guy loves salmon eggs, so that's why we added this to our order.  It's something we've only ordered once and not again though.\n\n* Nasu Agedashi ($5) - Fried eggplant served in a dashi broth and more salmon eggs.  Again, this was something we ordered because of the extra ikura, but not something that we have since repeated.\n\n* Roasted Chilean Seabass - This one came off their Specials board and it was so yummy!  Great choice.\n\n* Sesame Trio Dessert - Again, another one from the Specials Board and what a treat!  The creme brulee, the macaron, and the ice cream were all so good! \n\nService - we love when we are remembered and the waitress automatically brings a bowl and silverware for the Little Guy.  She also remembered our egg allergy and came out after our order was put in to remind me that I didn't request tamago out of my chirashi!  Yay for her! \n\nOverall, we love the simplicity of I-Naba and it's a welcome addition to Vegas.  It's a little hard to find without having a front street presence, but we are glad we did.  Hours are changing next month though!"
4,Awesome and delicious burgers! Great customer service and a nice casually place to dine!
4,"One of the two best places to go for ice cream/gelato in Las Vegas.  This newer spot on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Stratosphere is just wonderful.\n\nWe came here for a sweet treat and we weren't disappointed.  I had the sweet corn and my wife had the pistachio gelato.  Both were very good.  There are several tables so you don't have to go back to your car to enjoy your frozen treat!\n\nThe woman who owns the place is just a delight.  She is so friendly and she wants to have you try almost every flavor she makes. The shop is clean and bright and welcoming.  There is a bathroom and it was kept nicely clean.  In addition to the gelato, she serves some baked goods and coffee and tea.\n\nThe parking is the only potential drawback.  During the day, it's probably more difficult to get a space here but I got one right in front of the sexy clothing women's store.  Viva Las Vegas!\n\nI'll be back to try the chocolate gelato with two peppers to give it some heat with the cold."
3,"Loved the atmosphere... Off from the strip which was a nice change of pace. We don't drink wine so felt the wine that was included in your meal was a waste, but had a great experience! The service was also great!"
2,"Upscale Applebees?  I wouldn't know any other way to describe this place to someone.  Was in TSq for a movie and Brio was packed so we gave this place a shot.  Famous for their portions and general apathy for  human beings sodium/fat/calorie intake...my wife was excited.  \n\nI got the steak and bean chili in a sourdough bowl which also came with 2 more pieces of bread for $10.  Exactly what I wanted and it totally hit the spot for a relatively cold Vegas evening.  My wife for some reason opted for the filet mignon.  I am totally against getting steaks at places like this unless they're dirt cheap since they would never ever compare to the greatness of so many steak places we've been to.  This wasn't cheap but $25 for everything (salad, sides, bread) was doable.  Everything on her dish was ok but the zucchini sticks were really good and went well with the beer.  \n\nI didn't know they sold their own beer.  I had 2 large glasses of the red ale and thought it was great.  I could've gone for another if we had time.  \n\nIf we're back here...I think I would just opt for the bar and appetizer type food.  But then Miller's Ale House is a 2 min walk from here so I probably won't be back....maybe if we're with friends that have kids."
1,"Wait in line was 15 min, not too bad for 1:30 on Sunday. While waiting in line we noticed over 50% of the people dining were Asian, that was a good thing! And the carts for dim sum were hustling back and forth and all over the restaurant. We sat down right around 1:45... What happened to the carts?? The same 2 carts came round and round. We asked for a few items and the person said \""later\"" and kept on walking. We were so disappointed!! We heard the food was great, \""best in LV\"" and we got a total of 5 dim sum plates of food, nothing we really wanted, but we were so hungry!  One thing this town has no shortage of is good restaurants, so we won't be back and suggest others not waste their time if they are hungry. What we ate was okay, nothing special. And having to walk through the entire casino filled with cigarette smoke and leave so dissatisfied, we won't be back. Ever."
4,"I went to two nice restaurants this vegas trip, Twist and the Cut, and twist won hands down. \n\nWhen you go to a nice establishment and treated like a queen when you first walk into the door it sets a great presidence for the rest of your meal. The hostess new our reservation when she saw our group size, was ready to take our coats and quickly sat us at our table facing the view of the strip. She even had a purse holder ready for the female guests. \n\nOnce we ordered our drinks using their ipad, they gave us our menus and ample time to discuss our options. \n\nOur table got essentially every combination of the appetizer and meal option. Steak, lobster, pork, vegetarian and fish for the entrees and foie gras, crab, soup, cheese dish as the appetizer. all were amazing creation. They use various techniques from ice creamed blood sausage and cheese (two different dishes) to foams and gels with alcohol. Not only delicious but good conversation starters. \n\nSounds like a small meal for the price, right? Well, they gave a ton of starters. We had the amuse bouche of a cucumber gel, squid ink biscuit, and three others that were all amazing spouts of flavor. And then bread. Each person received their own basket of bread. All were delicious. And they kept asking us if we wanted more. They each came out warm and wonderful. \n\nThrough out our meal we were treated like royalty. A waiter was always watching our table to ensure we had everything we needed. Our plates cleared within a reasonable time (not too quickly, not too slowly) and cleaned our massive amounts of bread crumbs before each setting. \n\nIt was just a fantastic experience. \n\nhighly recommend for a date or with a group of friends."
2,"So. Many. Slot. Machines. EVERYWHERE. There is definitely no lack of entertainment if you have some time to kill although you may walk out dollars lighter.\n\nThere is also an American Express Centurion Lounge here.\n\nAs of December 2014, Las Vegas has temporarily suspended Uber so you are forced to take one of their taxis (if nobody is picking you up or you can't do public transportation)."
0,Worst service ever. I feel like everyone here has an attitude problem. They don't even greet or thank you. Ugh. I now drive out of my way to avoid this sbux.
0,"I'm surprised this place is still open. I tried this place for the first time this weekend and I've never been soooo disappointed by dim sum. I had been craving some dim sum the whole week and since I was in this area I gave it a shot...a shot on the foot would've been a better experience than eating here.\n\nThe hostess was too pre-occupied with shenanigans so we stood around for minutes. The place was dead. Grade B, C and another C on the wall. I wanted to leave but my friend wasn't willing to go to Chinatown. He has never tried dim sum and it's very unfortunate to have his cherry popped at a place like this.\n\nWe got Cha Siu bao, flat noodles with beef, Hargao, 2 orders of siumai and BBQ pork. Everything was bland. The Hargao and siumai were fishy. The Cha Siu bao and flat noodles completely lacked meat. All dough/noodles. \n\nI taught my friend a Chinese phrase to describe this place and the food: bu hao! Their BCC grade probably means Beeyotch Can't Cook! I couldn't sleep that night due to a terrible stomach ache."
1,"Me and my family were in Charlotte for my Sorority's conference and we decided to go to Mert's for our last night in Charlotte. The wait wasn't bad and they accommodated for a party of 9 which was also nice because most small restaurants would just seat you at different tables. We did not think the food lived up to the hype...at all. Lemonade...not freshly squeezed, even though the server said everything is made in house and fresh. Cornbread and Soul Roll...best part of the meal. Anything fried....TOO GREASY. I got fried catfish and my plate was covered in grease and whenever my fork went into the fish, more grease would spill out...EW! One food runner, female, came to our table with the wrong food. After no one claimed the wrong food she says, \""Do yall even know what you ordered?!\"".....ummm CLEARLY you just have the wrong food. Let's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal. Someone in the kitchen needs to change the oil, drain the food with a napkin (simple) and avoid getting grease on the entire plate. The yams tasted like they were drenched in maple syrup...and that's it....not good at all. My moms cooks better soul food."
4,"If your a major foodie and looking for an out of the ordinary dining experience then you NEED to check this place out. I went late and it was not too crowded, the service was basically on the spot, the bone marrow and duck wing were exceptional, and if your a dog person the patio is dog friendly (added bonus for my two dogs the bone that the marrow is served in is dog safe). I have not found food like this in the area and its definitely worth trying."
0,"I really wish the mic didn't have a mute button because the guy taking our order was cussing at customers in the drive through... If you don't like your job, find another one. Awful customer service and crappy ice cream. Oh and a tip for the employees based on my experience and all the bad reviews I've read (obviously isn't a problem just tonight) try smiling once and a while or treat people with respect."
2,"5 stars tot the staff and how quickly they operate givens that they were slammed. This is a fairly fresh option for people who are looking for a quick bite. I had a make your own salad and soup, my friend has the turkey panini and soup. My salad was good they make sure to keep the toppings you add to a minimum and some items looked like they might have been treated with chemicals so they don't spoil as fast. The tortilla soup was ok. I had very few veggies or chicken, it was 90% tortilla strips. The sandwich was dry but decent, but we didn't care for the jambalaya. I thought the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. If you're on-the-go this is a good option."
0,This has happened to me too many times so I felt the need to put them on blast. Went through the drive-thru and when I got home the order was not right. There's nothing worse than being hella hungry and finding your food to be not what you wanted! How f-ing hard is it to read an order and make it correctly. This is the last time I will be forced to eat something I didn't want. Drive-thru customers beware!!  Check your order-inside and out-before you leave.
1,"The salad the hubbie and I split (antipasto) was different from others in that it was mostly lettuce, but we liked that.  It was swimming in dressing, so I would order it again w/ the dressing on the side.\n\nThe pizza...tried the thin crust and I did not care for it because the dough was too tough for my taste.  The hubbie who is from Chicago said that it was true to a Chicago style where the dough is more chewy.  I couldn't even cut it w/ a dinner knife.\n\nMy favorite Chicago style pizza is deep dish.  Since there is no Gino's East, I will continue to get my deep dish craving taken care of by Rosati's dine-in location on McQueen and Ray.  When I want thin crust, it's gonna be either Rosati's or Oregano's wheat crust."
2,Very nice addition to the Venetian property.  The Palazzo is a relatively new hotel tower connected by shopping areas and walkways to the Venetian.  The rooms are suites which are quite large with 3 flat screen tvs.  Unfortunately the service (especially housekeeping) simply doesn't stand up to the quality of the hotel rooms.  We didn't have anyone make up our room one day.   We also had some issues with service around the pool area.
2,Happy hour is very good! The waitresses were very friendly.  The reason of taking 2 stars off was that the Asian man (hope he is not owner). He asked us whether we are ready to go while we were enjoying the dinner.  He put the check without saying anything. We felt we were NOT welcomed & rushed to get out!
4,"I told myself I would Yelp on every restaurant that I ate at on the course of this \""road trip\"" I'm taking, so here goes.  We started off in the familiar territory of Phoenix, AZ.  Our \""go to\"" spot in the northern suburbs of Phoenix used to be the Fish Market in Scottsdale, but since it \""changed hands\"" so to speak, we've been on the look out for another destination.  Well... I think we found it in Pappadeaux.\n\nService:  5/5\n\nThe service we received at Pappadeaux was outstanding from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  It was about 7:30 on a Friday evening when we got to the restaurant, and since we had been traveling, I did not have the opportunity to make reservations ahead of time.  The parking lot was VERY crowded and we were afraid of a long wait time.  But we were quoted 5-10 minutes when we arrived, and were seated after 7 minutes.  We got one of the few booths in the restaurant near the bar area.\n\nOur waiter, Nate, was very attentive and helpful.  He pointed out some of their more famous dishes and the specials, some of which we ended up ordering.  He was prompt in refilling our water glasses when needed and even stopped a moment to chat with us about our 4-month old son.  The only small blemish I would mention is that dessert was a long time in coming.  It took about ten minutes after we ordered it.  Now I know they don't bake cheesecakes on the fly, so I'm unsure about the reason for the delay, but I thought in the interest of being complete that I would mention it.\n\nFood:  5/5\n\nAbsolutely no complaints here.  Everything we ordered was outstanding.  My wife and I got the baked oyster trio and split a Greek salad for appetizers.  The salad was great and so were the oysters.  The salad is served table-side for that extra little touch.  If we were to order again though, I think we would have just gotten a full order of the Parmesan baked oysters instead of the trio.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the special of the evening which was Salmon Diablo, a blackened salmon fillet with extra kick.  The only very minor complaint I would note is the sauce was a bit too much.  It was absolutely delicious, a mix of crab meat and butter and cream, but it overpowered the fish to a degree.  I ended up eating it separately.   As I said, delicious, but a bit much.  My wife ordered the lobster bisque and it was every bit as good as other reviewers have commented.\n\nFor dessert we split a carrot cake cheesecake.  I'm always on the look out for new and interesting desserts, and while I have had tons of cheesecakes, this was a combination I hadn't encountered before, so I had to give it a try.  The sweet potato pie also looked interesting, but we went with the cheesecake.  Aside from the delay mentioned above, no complaints here.  The cake was moist, flavorful, and delicious.\n\nOverall Impressions:  5/5\n\nThe environment at Pappadeaux is exactly what you would expect.  They do a good job of bringing in that Cajun/creole atmosphere and balance an upscale look with a \""down home\"" attitude.  You'll feel right at home here in your t-shirt and jeans, or in your business attire after a long day at the office.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating.  \n\nOverall if you are looking for a seafood or creole meal in the Phoenix area, I can heartily recommend Pappadeaux."
4,"I love this place!\nFirst it is open till 7pm I stopped at 2 other nails spas that closed at 6 or 5  before going to Buddha Bar nail spa. I'm actually mad at myself for not going there first since it was my first choice off of yelp. Any whoo got there at 630pm and they took me and my daughter in no problem and they did not rush us.\nSecond I love this place because they gave my 8 year old a child's price for her pedicure. They didn't just let her splash her feet in water and paint her toes quickly. They gave her the full service and gave her as much attention and time as they did for me. In fact my daughter and her nail Tech Linda had a whole conversation and my daughter is truly shy. This was my daughter's 2nd pedicure. Her first pedicure was at a posh salon in California they gave her child's price but she was done in 7 minutes she waited forever for me to get done. With Buddha Bar they truly gave her the nail salon experience and I'm absolutely greatful at how they treated my daughter. Her dad who usually does not wAnt her painting her nails was happy with the outcome he said her feet was starting to look like his and now they are cute again.\nThird I love this place because of the chairs they were massage chairs as well!\nFourth I love this place because they are meticulous with what they do Leila worked on me and she did an awesome job Linda as well did an awesome job on my daughter  and everyone was nice.\nThe negatives I almost didn't walk in because of the surrounding  shops it was a western union ,pizza shop and a gas station in front of it. I thought because of the surrounding stores the inside was going to be dirty. But the inside of the shop is hardly comparable to what the outside area comes off as. Really modern, clean and the  music in there is very classy, cool jazz. \nI made the mistake of not checking in till after I left and I missed out on the check in deal.\nLove this place and is going to be my go to nail spa. \nBig thanks to that whole team for making my daughter and me day wonderful!"
3,"This is a great place with a cool atmosphere. It sort of has a retro/modern feel to it. They have a bunch of dart boards in the back which is always fun, good drink specials, some nice booths to hang out in and a great patio area. This is a place everyone should definitely experience a couple times. Also, I have never had the food here so I can't really speak on that."
1,"Admittedly, 3pm on a Thursday afternoon may not be the ideal time to assess a brew house, but it's worth logging the experience nevertheless. While the atmosphere at the bar wasn't unfriendly, it wasn't friendly either. Nothing like, \""be with you in moment\"" or \""what can I get you\"", but rather a somewhat removed bartender going through the perfunctory motions of his job and getting to you when he was good and ready, although without malice or attitude. Beyond that, the place seemed generally cheerless with a scattered assortment of that discomforting and singularly Vegasian type of the damned you run into occasionally off the Strip, not quite consigned to the clear, uncontested merit of hell, but somehow more vague and less defined--purgatorial or limbo-esqu--half plowed, engaged in chain smoking and vapid, pointless, loud conversation, or even worse, simply voiding any meaningful existence, head down, playing countertop video poker machines. The beer was certainly decent and what food came out of the kitchen looked adequate (at best). As a friend noted hours later after we'd left and found ourselves five minutes into a visit to Big Dog's Brewery, \""I already like this place a hundred times better than the Chicago Brewing Company.\"" Woof."
2,There was something off about this recent. None of the staff had a genuine smile or outgoing friendliness during the entire time we were eating in the location. I am a big fan of INNOUT and expected better service.
0,"We were married here one year ago. Do not get married here. \nHere were just a couple of the disappointments. there were more, i promise. It was very disorganized.  We had a lot of rain and had ro move from the rooftop. Dawn, our wedding planner, said she was coordinating all this. Not true. My husband didn't even know what area we were getting married in and went to the rooftop! Dawn had not been there to help, to guide or even update him on the change!! Umm. .. He was the groom and needed to know!! There was no coordination by our so-called wedding planner. My girls did not know when to go. It was so incredibly disorganized.  The second major disappointment was about the shrimp cocktail hors d'ouvre. We were VERY VERY VERY clear that we wanted one shrimp cocktail served in a shot glass ... one per guest... instead they serve just watered down ceviche. When we approached dawn .... as I saw the ceviche go by, I asked her to please change it to the shrimp cocktail that we discussed. Dawn said that she would. 10 minutes later I checked again (as we try to get pictures done) and it was still the wrong order. After the wedding we call Dawn on several occasions  to discuss. Brace yourself... she said too bad; I guess everybody must have been happy because they ate it. HELLO?! WE were not happy!  This was our wedding and we did not want to serve ceviche in a shot glass and have people shoot it back!!! We wanted to serve a shrimp cocktail in a shot glass hanging off the side which we were very very very clear about. Dawn said that she would refund the shrimp cocktail; she never did.  My husband called her again; she never responded. I called her again; she never responded. On the 4th attempt she said I'll send you guys a voucher for a free night stay during the summer. Well that voucher never came and we've been married over a year!! I would steer clear if you want a very elegant wedding done just the way you want. It is still so upsetting a year later. Bottom line: It wasn't cheap and wasn't done right."
3,"I really like this place. I have gone there several times and the food on the restaurant side of the store is always fresh and good. The last time there I had the hummus (best in the burg) and spinach pie. Also had the chick pea salad , yummm! In the past I have had the chicken kabab, and kind of a chickpea stew served over rice. It is done steam table style so you can look over the food before you buy so you can try different things. Try the goat meat it's really good. The decor is like a cafeteria, so fancy it's not. The prices aren't fancy either. Two can eat for about $20, including a piece of baklava for dessert..\nIf just rating the food I would give it 5 stars"
0,"Needed to have a quick dinner and the beautiful wife wanted to try a new Chinese place. Let's just say it was not all that good. \n\nPhoenix and dragon... Combo general tso's and spicy shrimp... Fried chicken parts with broccoli in watery sweet hot sauce with no flavor. Shrimp with ketchup sugar and red pepper flakes. Not good. \n\nChicken with brown sauce... Fish fried chicken in sweet dark sauce with vegetables and peanuts. No flavor. Nothing redeeming. \n\nBeef with pea pods. Over salted and meat barely edible. Pea pods were ok.\n\nHot and sour soup was actually egg flour soup with vinegar and chili flakes added. The cornstarch was a noticeable ingredient. Not good. \n\nOrdered brown rice. Was not fully cooked dry and not edible. \n\nThe front counter person was attentive and nice. So it was not a total loss, except for a waste of money."
1,"The deals here are impressive, that is for sure. Very cheap. \n\nThe chicken is tasty. And so are the biscuits, which no healthy human should be consuming, but what the hell -- one has to splurge sometimes, I suppose. \n\nAnd this area does not offer much for fast food options with chicken as the primary focus (Cane's nearby, Farm Basket far away, and BFG/Strip N Dip even farther away), or anything really at Church's price-point. \n\nStuff like a shrimp basket with french fries for 3.59$, the so-called \""Big Tex\"" for 2.49$, and biscuits for 50\u00a2 ea.; manager's special of five chicken strips and two biscuits for 5$; et al.\n\nSo, why the two stars, E? \n\nI do not know: I have experienced better. It is a really dirty restaurant. \n\nI have seen \""animals\"" that should be \""restricted\"" scurrying about. I have also been to New York City, so it does not make it prohibitive or forbidden to me, but for fuck's sake ....\n\nOn the latest SNHD inspection (http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php), they are rocking the infamous Violation 16, which is exactly what my star deductions are based on ... for those unfamiliar (\""pest control\""). \n\nSNHD still inexplicably permits them, as well as other eateries, to maintain an \""A\"" grade even with the suspect V-16. \n\nSomething to keep in mind for those that believe the giant black \""A\"" on the piece of white paper comes with a level of certainty that fuckery like this will not be afoot. - E"

0,"Horrible experience! \nNo customer service \nEmpty pans \nFood was discussing, even the jello and ice cream, couldn't get those right. I live right across the street And I'll never go there again, don't recommend it to anyone."
1,"The food is good BUT BEWARE of the conniving ways they use to get more money out your visit.\nFirst, when the bill is brought to you there will be a service charge of 15% added to your check, after tax, even if there is only one or two in your party. This is NOT disclosed on the menu or anywhere else in the establishment. And, if you pay by credit card, the customer copy nor the merchant copy will reflect that they have included this \""service fee\"" \nSecond, I knew of this little scheme when I visited there so I was prepared and gave the additional \""tip\"" as cash. But, lo and behold, when I received my credit card statement they had added an additional amount to my bill AFTER I left. I called to question and was told that if the tip is not adequate they add more!! WHAT???? When I told him I left the tip on the table he said he didn't know that but \""now you know how we do things.\"" \nI have filed a complaint with the BBB. I hope this review will make others more attentive to their bill and credit card statements."
0,"We thought that when the name changed they may have also improved the quality of the food, but we were wrong. It really is not worth going again. Best thing is the fact that they are open late. But McDonald's is too so you may as well go there. Better food and way cheaper."
0,"Sigh. I asked an employee to help me find hardware for curtains, and she pointed vaguely to a corner of the store and said, \""If we have it, it's over there somewhere.\""\n\nAfter I found what I needed, I went back and asked another employee a question about the merchandise. She shrugged and looked at me blankly. I asked if there was anyone who could help me, and she heaved a tremendous sigh and called the first unhelpful young woman over. She wasn't able to answer my question, either, and concluded by saying, \""We only make minimum wage, and no one trains us.\""\n\nThat says everything you need to know about the lack of customer service."
2,"First, check this out: their high tech and info-loaded digital bar menu is a triptych in itself.  It's a three paneled visual display. Their company logo also has hints at three-ness in the number of traditional beer ingredients. I've heard that the name has something to do with the number of brewery founders too.  \n\nSecond, as noted by our local guide, the weekend bartender often has a broken arm, leg, wrist, etc.  Brewer by day, ultimate fighting hobbyist or stunt car driver by night? We never got around to asking. He seemed like a nice guy and he skillfully, solely managed all aspects of a quickly filling tap room.\n\nThird, try out their experimental/hop-school series, which does a nice job of showcasing single-hop ipa flavors. During both of my visits to Triptych, they've only had one of these hop school beers on tap, but it would be nice to have 2 or more varieties side by side in taster sizes so that I can learn how to pin down the flavors that separate amarillo hops, say, from mosaic hops.\n\nTriptych is clean, affordable and friendly.  While I think all those things are necessary for a good operation, they're not sufficient for an outstanding brewery.  In other words, when I recommend going to a tap room, I don't necessarily get people thrilled about it due to cleanliness, friendliness and affordability.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much memorable (besides a cool menu board) about the space, the brand, or the beer that I can point to and get excited about. \n\nHowever, with the examples I noted above, I think they've got a lot of potential as they develop over time.  I don't think gimmick is the right word for it, but rather highlights of their business. For example, I think they could benefit and get people interested from building and expanding cool ideas like their hop school series, which has tons of opportunity given all the new, classic and diverse hops out there. As an outside example related to brewing and branding, it seemed like Half Acre in Chicago didn't really take off and set themselves apart until they matched up their creative recipe one-off brews with equally creative naming and labeling from Phineas Jones. Triptych could use some artistic direction to find their groove.\n\nSome of Triptych's beer was above average and some of it was more of a work in progress, but all of it was enjoyable.  I think they should try to find an angle, style or feature that separates themselves from other breweries.  Or I could be a bad judge of what makes for a popular brewery around Champaign-Urbana-Savoy, and the locals are completely satisfied with its approachability.  Regardless, I'll probably be back the next time I visit the area and I'll see what limb the bartender has broken most recently."
1,How can this be a 5. The ruben sandwich was half warm and did not have great flavor.
1,"Sushi Mon is pretty mediocre in my opinion. I had a lot of their nigiri during my visit. Not bad, but not the greatest.\n\nThe one and ONLY memorable thing here, SNOW CRAB NIGIRI. A must try if you're going to visit Sushi Mon.\n\nI have found a better sushi spot and will not be returning."
0,SLOW...SLOW...SLOW.....the food is terrible....think it is straight from sam's club
1,I've been here twice and it's okay. Service is super slow. Nothing stood out in my opinion.
4,"Just Nails has changed their name to Kim's Nails. They're under new ownership and I couldn't be happier.  Rose, formerly at TC Nails, is now here. I had a shellac manicure and am very satisfied. Everything is extremely clean and sanitary and the technicians provide top notch service."
1,"I almost give this place 3 stars, but as far as my experience goes, it's not there yet, and I would honestly rather have IHOP or Denny's.  Saturday morning at 9:30ish seems to be prime time for breakfast, and Over Easy proved that with the gaggle of people hanging out outside.  Since I was starving we quickly found another place via Yelp Mobile, and we ended up here. \n\nThe patio is cute with tons of shade provided by the greenery.  The inside however is awfully tacky and very poorly put together.  I was embarrassed for the owners just looking at it.  We were told to sit anywhere and we found ourselves at a little two top against the wall.  Service was prompt and we were quickly given our GIANT cups of soda, always a plus for me.  I ordered a dish that had hash browns, 3 eggs any way, bacon, and I subbed biscuits and gravy for the bread.  The amount of food on my plate was massive.  The hash browns took up a whole third of the plate real estate, but that was unfortunate as they were rather tasteless.  They were lacking in the salt/grease/butter department.  Next up, my eggs were overcooked in the yolk part but somehow not cooked enough in the whites.  It was weird, but still edible and not the way I like them.  The bacon... well there was a lot of it.  I thought that was a wonderful thing until I bit into overly fatty bacon that was cooked for way too long.  It was just really salty and crunchy.  For the first time ever, I did not eat all of the bacon in front of me.  The biscuits and gravy was by far the worst part of my meal.  The biscuits were very hard, dry, and flavorless.  It was as if they had been sitting out for at least a few days.  The gravy was pretty bad.  It was completely over-peppered and was super thick and congealed.  It wobbled instead of dripped.  Kind of gross.  When I smothered it on top of the hash browns it was a little bit better.\n\nThe husband enjoyed his dish much more than I did mine.  Maybe we will go back some time, but I know what to avoid and how to specify my bacon to be cooked.  For now, it's just a meh."
0,"Feel like being treated like an asshole by some pencil necked geek, because you asked for a dark roast at 2:30 in the afternoon?  Then this is the place for you!"
3,"Salad and Go: Okay, focus on Salads...but I am here to announce their breakfast is fast and filling...also decently healthy.\nGet the Peanut Butter Wrap-- yes you can make that in your home, but the point is that a delicious breakfast that won't make your pores greasy, is available for consideration.\nI will agree with the other reviews...if you get a salad it is a hit or miss regarding the meat. I have been here several times and it is a hit or miss. Sometimes I am surprised and pleased for the amount of chicken I receive, and then other times I feel my meat is playing hide-and-seek."
3,"Thank you yelp to introducing me to my favorite unique sandwich spot!\n\nWildflower is a cute chain, very much like panera bread, incorperating the norm with fun and funky but warm flavors.  With a great range of bread choices, different mustards and cheeses, toppings and combos and sides, its hard to not find a sandwich you will love.  \n\nThough I've had a lot of different things here, my absolute FAVORITE sandwich in this world is the BLT plus.  Do me a favor - do the BLT plus, switch brie for cheddar, and add cucumber - and you will be sandwich heaven."
3,Can't get enough of this place and after living 11 years in Az I have tried many Mexican restaurants.  Love the patio and the relaxing vibe (especially on Sundays) and the pollo fundido sauce.\nHave introduced friends to the Fountain Hills location and they are hooked too!
3,"AYCE has come to Kaze Sushi since their initial opening.  The AYCE menu is smaller than Goyemon/Sushi Mon, but is also a little different.  They have grilled/skewered meat items, such as chicken gizzards, soft shell shrimp, bacon wrapped dates, etc on their AYCE menu that sets them apart from other places.  The sushi selection isn't as big as I would like (i.e. no snow crab or white tuna), but the salmon and yellowtail nigiri were buttery good.  They have some random fishes that I haven't seen elsewhere such as wahoo and striped bass.  I don't really eat rolls, so that part of the AYCE menu was overlooked by me.  The price is the same as all other AYCE.  While I still prefer Goyemon, what I don't prefer is the wait time and service there....so for attentive and quick service, I'd pick Kaze."
2,"Noodles and Company is an okay place for lunch, and by okay I mean not that great. It's located on campus, which makes it an easy destination for lunch. They serve Asian-style noodles, Italian pasta, and American pasta (think: macaroni and cheese etc). They also have soups and salads. You get to pick your size (regular or small), and can add ingredients (such as meat) if you like. I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes: they were alright but really not too impressive. I wouldn't mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper."
0,"Holy cow.  I've never been to a place this packed.  I mean, dangerously packed.  There's no where to go.  We only checked this place out because we had just seen the movie of the same name, and thought it would be fun.  After weaving our way through the thick mass of people, we decided that getting to the bar was impossible and got the heck out.\n\nLoud and rowdy.  Can't comment on the drinks.  Didn't like feeling like a sardine.  Luckily we didn't have to pay cover that night."
1,"I want an Owlzilla and I want one now *stomps feet*\n\nFat bastard wouldn't sell me one and they are the only good thing about this place.  (Except for wings, read below)\n\nThe casino is the size of a peehole.  The girls do not have hot hootz or hot asses.  Fuhglee bitches in tight orange shorts, shiny hosiery (that's pantyhose for hos), ohhh, you all know the uniform.\n\nService is slow.  The bartender chick was ugly and rude and poured weak drinks, and I was PAYING for these drinks.  I understand to order beer if I'm gambling, but my pretty lil ass was sitting at the bar and I expect some vodka with my soda, thank you very much.\n\nWhy two stars????  Because after 11pm, they serve 10 chicken wings for $2.50 and I'm a girl who likes a bargain.  The 9-1-1 wings were pretty spicy.  Almost a lil too spicy, but darn tasty.\n\nNever again Not So Hot Hootz-ers, unless I'm nearby and craving wings."
2,"Something made me want to stop for a late dinner so I gave in to my instincts. The restaurant looks non-descript and generic from the outside, and pretty much does on the inside too. \n\nI had the place to myself so seating wasn't an issue, although it is larger than it looks and has ample seating. I was greeted promply and made to feel welcome and comfortable. The menu has a few unique items, but for the most part mainstream items.\n\nThe crab wantons came out quickly so I seriously doubted they would be fresh, but to my pleasant surepise they were. The quality and flavor was very good, and I believe them when they said they use fresh ingredients.  The sweat sauce was impressive and made from scratch and you could tell it wasn't from a can or bought in bulk.\n\nThe General Toa's chicken was good and they made the \""heat\"" to order. I asked for a 5 out of 10, but I was more like a 3. The food was good and the serving was just right, not tiny but not ridiculous either.\n\nThe waitor, Terry said he was one of the ownersand was very open about the menu and the credentials of the chef. The food showed his love of cooking so I'll be back to try his other \""specialties\"" soon."
2,"Outstandingly amazing squash curry. Just really good. Perfect. 5 stars.\n\nSo why the 3? Well gather round, children.\n\nWhen the food came out we were starving. It didn't look quite like squash curry, but it could have been it, so we each had a bite. We quickly realized that it wasn't, and then waited for the server to come back to ask if we had the right dish. She came back, bringing us the correct dish and apologizing. OK, great. No harm, no foul.\n\nThen she proceeded to take the other dish and gave it to another table! We had just eaten out of it! Just beware and make sure you're food comes straight from the kitchen. Who knows how else they operate here if they're willing to do that.\n\nStill though, the squash curry was frakkin' delicious."
1,"I am sooooo pleased to see that I am NOT the only one who thinks this place is over priced. I am also disappointed, if true, that the owner lives like a queen off of this place. Yesterday was the first time Ive gone to the Magical Forrest and I was surprised at the cost for the not so much it offers. The hot chocolate tasted like hot water with the color of chocolate, we asked for another. The slide should be bigger for what you pay. \n\nNot all is negative though. Besides the price, inside is really cute. And many opportunities to take cute family pictures.\n\nJust take plenty of spending money if you are going with more than one child."
3,"I had no idea that Las Vegas had a library. Which is silly, especially because I am a student as CSN and I drive pass this location regularly. I guess since the kindle app came about I haven't thought about reading real books.... Until now. \n\nI needed some books on marketing and I didn't want to shell out tons of $$ for a one time read. I looked it up, and to my surprise other people in Vegas read as well! At least enough people for there to be a public library. I found that the library card process was very simple and quick. I also found my desired books very fast and I was able to check out easily at the self checkout. \n\nI cant wait to go back and check out some more books!"
4,Best donuts around and great prices! They have the most amazing donut holes and they are 99 cents a dozen! They only have glazed but they are soo good!  I recommend Bosa's to everyone!
0,"Where should I start? Should have known it wasn't gonna be good when we pulled up and customers were scarce. The place was dirty, there were unbussed tables and the staff looked taxed. We were told to sit anywhere there was a menu so we picked the least dirty looking table. The menu looked like what I expected, American fare geared towards an older palate. I asked if they had a salad bar and the hostess said yes but then came back to tell us they had \""broken it down already\"". It took quite a while to get our order in. You could tell our waitress was trying but seemed a bit overwhelmed. I ordered a half a grilled cheese sandwich and their \""Tuscan tomato soup\"" for $7.50. I opened up my silverware and noticed that it was filthy (not just water spots, I'm talking stuck on food). The food came out after what seemed like forever and it was a joke. The cheese wasn't melted on my sandwich which was teeny and my soup had some mystery contents that Id rather not describe. When our waitress returned to the table to ask how everything was, I couldn't help but tell her that it had been a horrible experience. She talked to the manager who adjusted our bill which was appreciated but I don't think I will ever be returning to this place again. Just horrible all around!"
2,"Craving something different from the usual Indian takeaways I usually go for, I decided to try out Jade Palace, as it is located right next to my girlfriend's flat.  \n\nMy main experience of Chinese food has been courtesy of Jimmy Chung's and as this is pretty much mass produced, I expected something a little different from Jade Palace. However, I was disappointed.  The cantonese style  sweet and sour I had was certainly nothing to get too excited about and the friend rice I had alongside was also fairly unspectacular, although still fairly nice to eat.  The prawn crackers were also very similar to those that I could buy from the supermarket for about half the price.  \n\nThe saving grace was the curry sauce and noodles that my girlfriend ordered.  The curry sauce was deliciously smooth and not grainy as is often the case. The noodles proved to be jammed tight into the foil container, and as a result the portion was very generous. The prices seemed fairly standard: they did not strike me as particularly cheap but they also did not make my jaw drop to the floor as other Chinese takeaways have done.  \n\nOverall, if you're nearby and are desperately craving a bit of Chinese takeaway, this is fine. However, if possible, shop around first to avoid too much disappointment."
1,"RUDE, rude bouncers, rude people. This place was packed to the gills, you could not walk or hardly breath. no one lets you pass and people push you, this male bouncer actulaly pushed my female friend WTF!!!. There are vip tables in each corner of the club so the dance floor is really compact, there is a techno house room and the other room was playing 70s music, all in all not the best experience. But the music in the main room was good and there were  free shot girls walking around earlier in the night.."
3,"Great carne asada chimi, combo #20, crispy and flavorful.  Lots of Guacamole too.  The staff were laughing and singing in the back, great place and I will be back!"
4,"I can't even begin to express my gratitude to Kevin for picking us up when our car died in the middle of nowhere at lake apache.  he not only came out an hour and a half out of his way, but squished 4 of us in to the front of the cab.  during the long ride back, we ended up stopping at a great Mexican restaurant with him and his wife, and then we dropped the car off and he gave us a ride home.  He was so entertaining and fun, making a really crappy situation much more enjoyable.  Thanks so much Kevin, you're amazing!!!!"
0,"Overpriced, sub-par food can be forgiven if the service is decent. I've been in the service industry for a long time and understand what rude customers and being in the weeds is all about. When a restaurant is nearly empty and servers are standing around, there is no excuse for bad service. They make minimum wage, customers' tips are their bread and butter, if they are at least nice or pretend like they don't hate their job. Our drinks were not refilled once, dirty dinner plates and long finished appetizers were on the table when we left, after dessert. The thin, dark haired manager (if that's what they call him), is the worst!!! Managers are there to smooth out situations, he made ours worse. He was uncaring and argumentative, then stood at the door smirking at me. The guy desperately needs Customer Service 101 training. Thanks for ruining our rare night out Arribas !"
0,"Stopped by this morning to see what breakfast was like. Greeted and told about the breakfast tacos. Friendly staff, told them it was my first time there and they offered samples. The samples tasted fine, so I decided to purchase some breakfast tacos and take them home where my son and I could share them. Got some bbq sauce also. Cut each one in half in order to sample all three. Nothing special......until later in the day. Shortly after noon both I and my son experienced stomach and intestinal problems that persisted until late afternoon. Only thing it could have been is those dang breakfast tacos. My son said they tasted strange and he must have been right, maybe under cooked pork or somehow tainted, but no matter, there was something wrong. Not often do I give a place a second chance once they have made me sick, so I will pass on further trips to Rudys. To bad, I was looking for a good bbq place."
0,Are you kidding me. First room wasn't clean. 2nd room had flooding in the shower. They will upgrade to a smoking suite . No way! Then the front desk rep hung up on us while in conversation.
0,"My wife and I are new to Vegas and love a good burger.  We live close to this location and had been excited about trying this restaurant.  We have 2 children under 3 so one day when they were napping I ran over to get 2 burgers to-go.\n\nI placed my order and after 15 minutes of waiting I started to wonder how long it would take.  At 20 minutes I started getting a little annoyed.  After 25 minutes I was standing in front of the counter clearly a little ticked and nobody said anything to me.  I finally received my take-out and the general manager handed me the bag and didn't even say anything.  I looked at the receipt and it took 27 minutes!\n\nI have worked at high and low end restaurants and NOTHING takes that long, not even a well-done steak.  All we ordered was a regular burger done medium and veggie burger.  Any manager with minimal customer service skills should have realized at 15 minutes it was taking too long and he was up there looking at the order tickets the whole time.\n\nIn addition, my wife said her burger was undercooked of all things and mine was average at best.  \n\nI was so disappointed that I wrote them an email on their website and they didn't even bother to respond.\n\nPerhaps their food is better if you eat in but I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this business and how they run things, especially not having enough class to write me back, that I fear that will never happen.  So very disappointed."
2,"I went here for lunch the other day. I had the shrimp etoufee, which was a little pricey for lunch at $13.50. I was hoping it was going to be a decent size portion, but it was on the smaller side. It was pretty good, but it was small and there wasn't much shrimp in it. I had a feeling it was going to be a smaller entree, so I went ahead and ordered a side of fries to get started. I should have asked first, but I didn't, and go figure, the fries are frozen (ie, not hand-cut). Personally, I feel, restaurants at this price range should be serving hand-cut fries standard. They do have Frank's hot sauce though, which is a plus always. I did not have any beer this day, so this review is only for the food. Service was decent, though I did have to ask for water a couple times before I got a refill at one point."
2,"Really a 2.5...\n\nI was driving home one day after work thinking about what I was going to eat for dinner. I've been on a salad binge trying to lose the pre-holiday weight. Haha. So what do I see? A brand new Subway joint on my way home! Sweet! Usually I have to drive another 10 minutes out of my way but thats no biggie either.\n\nSo I roll in and apparently they've just opened a few days ago. So new that they dont even have credit card machines yet. So I step up and order my favorite roast beef sandwich. The prices are the same as other Subway's so that wasnt a big deal. The real kicker to me is how they make the sandwiches. What do I mean?\n\nI want the sandwich maker person to make my sandwich like if they were trying to put the place out of business. There are several Subways around town with specific people that make sandwiches with extra meat on them without even asking... Because really... It's not coming out of their pocket. If you really think about it, they actually gain more because of the tips they would be getting. I have no problem tipping a person $2 for a $5 sandwich if they make it heavy on the meat.\n\nSo the nice lady just goes and lays around 6-8 slices of roast beef on my foot long and was a little skimpy on the veggies. Oh well... I guess I'll have to try another sandwich maker before I write this place off and go back to my regulars."
1,"The appearance outside of the buffet seems to be lacking of business and happiness. But the line was short and mom and I were hungry anyway. Price for lunch is $25. If you are a lover of crepes which they also sell outside, I prefer you to come here. As for the food, kinda shitty. They basically had veggies cooked in three ways in each section. Also serving mashed potatoes, overly heavy pasta, turkey and prime rib which I didn't have. Horrible selection of sushi and fruit. Sushi rolls seemed like raw white urchins. Fruit was in a dressing pot which only had melon, pineapple, and melon. So you get my point. Dessert was basically cookies, brownies, \""cakes\"", just like at any other $10 buffet. Later they started serving macaroons. Personally, I don't like them and trying one made me want to spit the calories back out. So please, if you come here.... Eat two or three crepes and it will be worth it. (Custom or the flavors are on the wall)"
3,"I have been here on several occasions and really like it. It is a small and intimate place with wonderful servers, great food, and a nice wine list.  It is a bit odd that this nice resturant is tucked away in a corporate park rather than being in a center with a mix of retail and restaurants, but it works nonetheless. \n\nI love the Shrimp \""Ooo La La!!!\"" which is flash fried & tossed in a sweet & sour Papaya vinaigrette. And, we also love the Diver Scallops as well as the Sea Bass. Since we both love Cr\u00e8me Brulee, we usually go for the Trio of Cr\u00e8me Brulee  - delish!! \n\nThe restaurant is a little pricey but worth the splurge. Also, we have been when they have participated in Restaurant Week -- or  when they have offered fixed price specials.  This is a nice way to try Global for the first time, because you get a choice of selected appetizers, entrees, and desserts for a fixed price."
0,"I've now tried Manny's twice...both times were equally terrible.  The food comes in at a decent price point but certainly not great.  Especially considering how hard it seems to be for them to get an order right, and or serve quality food.  \n\nI've had the fajitas, they were bland and boring.  There salsa is on par with the Pace you pick up at the grocery store.  We will not go back for a third try."
0,"ZERO STARS!I would NEVER rent from this company again, had I known what my experience would be like.I am Canadian, and was moving to Las Vegas in September 2011.I needed to secure a house while I completed my medical training in Las Vegas for two years.My realtor helped me by viewing properties for me and sending video however ultimately, I had to decide.I picked a property to rent for 1195.00 USD monthly on a one year contract, 3 bedroom 2.5 bath in Southern Highlands.Nice house, had everything I would need and more.  However, from day one there was nothing but issues.Drove down from Canada with a lot of furniture, and unfortunately due to some delays arrived in Las Vegas in the evening (around 8 pm).Bruce, the property manager, was rude on the phone having to bring out keys and do an inspection at that time - as he said it was not in his job description.  However, reluctantly, he met us at the property finally - because we refused to take his advice to get a hotel for the night, mostly considering we had pets and needed to get into the home we had rented. We did a quick \""once over\"" of the property, mostly because he was rude (even my parents were in town and helped us move, and he was rude to them).  He quickly had us sign a bunch of move in paperwork and left.  That week we began making notes of issues with the property for our move-in sheet.  The most important issues being dark black stains in the kitchen, near the back door where there was water damage previously, and upstairs in the master bathroom outside the shower (where there is carpet when you step out).  Other odds and ends needed to be fixed along the way of the rental, namely the dishwasher stopped working and/or was leaking multiple times, fridge would not keep cold items cold yet would freezer burn all freezer food (even after adjusting settings repeatedly), garbage disposal backed up and was replaced.  All applicances needed replacement.  The most frustrating was when the fridge needed replacement and Bruce did so with a smaller, cheaper version and said that is what we get considering the multitude of replaced items recently.  However, what he fails to realize as a manager is that items break, especially with rentals, and those are necessities.  He continued to be rude and give issues.  He even delayed services or call backs when toilets stopped working properly, the A/C stopped working in the middle of summer heat... etc.  Clearly they don't care about their tenants.With regards to the black issues at move in, the company had a guy come (some handyman), who claimed it was \""fine\"".However, over time of living in the property, I continued to get very sick. And so did my brother (who rented the house with me).Once my brother moved out he began to feel better.Being that we are both medical doctors, we started to question the black stuff as \""mold\"".The red flag was the water damage, and how even with antibiotics I was not getting better BUT once my brother moved out, he did.I read online, and this seemed to be an issue.I asked again, and Bruce as property manager failed to respond.I requested that the areas be tested for mold, especially since my contract was up for renewal.  I did not want to move out (inconvenience and cost mainly, but the location worked well to get to hospitals on time for work).I continued to repeatedly call or write, and nothing.I even attempted to contact the owners as per the information provided in my lease after multiple attempts to contact Bruce, the property manager.However the owners being of Asian decent either pretended not to be them when I called OR I was given the wrong owner information.Either being the case, I requested Bruce give me the proper information - after reading Nevada Law (which governs the lease agreement) and speaking with my realtor.Bruce refused.  Instead I ended up having a company complete a mold test and paid for services myself.I then instead of hearing from the property manager received a written letter to end tenancy.They stated the owners did not want to renew my lease.What was funny was I had already renewed it once, and by this time had been living there 21 months. It was clearly about my concern of mold.With that, my mold test came back - showing mold in the property capable of making me sick the way it had.I now had very little time to find a new home, and incurred major costs for moving.I cleaned the property and the carpets, however apparently not to the liking of Bruce. He deducted 150.00 USD from my deposit for the carpets, which looked cleaner than when I moved in (pictures to prove this). He even attempted to charge me for A/C filters (dirty when I moved in), when I told him I would give him new ones. I recorded the entire move out, and signed the move out forms which said nothing regarding the A/C filters being dirty or the carpets. I requested they pay me costs I incurred and they refused.Now I have to go to court for this - worst part is new tenants will have same issues :"
0,"As much as I like the breakfast at McDonald's, I will no longer be going to them. WHY? One reason, their Wi-Fi. It is without a doubt the absolute worst on the planet. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are fantastic but McDonald's is very, very, very bad."
3,"Disclaimer: i Have not tried the original one in NYC, so i have nothing to compare this one too\n\nafter walking for 10minutes, which felt like 30 because of the heat, nothing sounds more refreshing then frozzzzen hot chocolate!\n\nWe didn't want to wait thirty minutes to be seated inside, which was probably a big mistake because it took 20minutes anyway standing in the heat, in the to go line and we probably did not get the same amount of frozzen hot chocolate  if we were to go inside. \nbut nonetheless, because it tasted so good, i did not mind at all! and the whip cream topped it all off. \n\nI also ordered a pink lemonade for the bf, which he stated was good. \n\nSo I would probably be back again...it is kinda pricey but worth it"
0,"I've been to many Las Vegas clubs, and this was by far the worst.\n\nEntry: As we came up the escalator, first thing we saw was Metro Cops everywhere (not casino security.  Then, there are multiple lines for different things, I'm not sure even the bouncers know what is what.  To round that off people were cutting in front of us across the ropes.  The bouncers checking the lists didn't even check ours, the girls we were with were amongst the hottest in line.  Once to the elevator they crammed us in like sardines.\n\nClub: After an elevator ride up, we entered the club which is on the roof of the Cosmo with indoor and outdoor areas.  The main dance floor is too small, no room to dance, lacks high-quality lighting and sound (Drai's, Wynn, and Rain are better.\n\nDrinks: We ordered the same drinks 3 times in a row and were quoted different prices each time, upon asking about this the third time, the bartender rudely said we got a receipt with each drink, we didn't...  ON top of that, the drinks are weak, not even worth buying.\n\nCrowd:  The crowd was rude and careless, two people in my party had drinks dropped near them.  Another had her own drink dropped by someone right after getting it, of course the bartender after seeing this told us he wouldn't replace it.\n\nExiting:  We left early because the club sucked, we went to the elevators we entered through, we were rudely told we were not allowed to use these elevators and the exit was through the adjacent hallway.  So we went to the adjacent hallway and found out the exit was actually through the hotel's emergency exit stairwell.  The girls we were with both had high heels, so we had to carry them down the stairs for safety (approx. 4-5 flights)\n\nI will never go back, this club is a disgrace for Las Vegas."
4,"I remember going into Forefathers the first day they were open. The owner still recognizes me when I go in. Gotta love a family owned business turning out the best product n the city and doing well. This place sells itself but in case you are in doubt about the best Philly Cheese Steak in the city, take the Pepsi challenge you will become a believer."
3,"The rest of the reviews here have a kernal of truth to them. They won't toss you no matter how drunk u are. That's usually how I stumble in here at 2 or 3 am after too many drinks at the Double Down or the circle bar at the HR, and sometimes I'm even toting my longboard (skateboard) by my side (which is pretty much a rare sight in Vegas--skateboards in public, I mean). I sit at the bar and order the chicken friend steak friend chicken and it always hits the spot. Is it overpriced. Yah, but what isn't in Vegas? I like the HR and have always been treated well here. And that says a lot because I am usually hammered on my ass when I am here. (They know how to treat the hammered right!!)  Mr. Lucky's saves me from hangovers (thanks, brudda). Also, I like good, decent diner, truck stop food, having driven across country twice and stayed/lived at truck stops the whole way. This place does the diner thing better than most of the coffee shops in Vegas. And that, brudda, is good eatin'"
0,"I'd give less if I could. You like to swim? Sorry the pool is closed about 80% of the time. Enjoy spinning class? Yeahhhh, the air conditioner is broke and let me tell you people, its hot, really really hot. Want to work on machines? Get in line, to bad half of them are broke. The free weights are in hiding, embarrassed to show their face in such a low class gym. The people who are members call it the ghetto LA fitness. Do yourself a favor go to 24 hour fitness."
1,"Really wanted to like this place. So disappointed. Arrived about 11:15 on a weekday to an empty restaurant. Immediately ordered (to a very unfriendly waitress/cashier) two food items & a fresh juice. By 11:35 we had one of our food items. It took until almost 11:40 to get everything we ordered. Once the food arrived, it was really good. The fresh juice was room temperature and gross, but we got a turkey sandwich that was delish & the green eggs & ham flatbread which was also excellent. But not worth the poor, SLOW service."
1,"This is my first time here so I won't be too harsh, but I can't say that I would come back for lunch again. I ordered two slices of pep and a drink. The size of each slice is solid but my pizza came out pretty well done. The cheese was blackened and it didn't look very good. If I was working here I probably wouldn't have served it. Maybe I'll give it another go and try something else."
0,"this was by far the worst pizza I have had in a long time. It was basically a frozen cheese pizza that they added extra toppings on to as you ordered.  It was stale, only kinda warm and well pretty much sucked.  I know it's an airport, but I have had wolfgang pucks pizza at the chicago airport and its decent.  the thing that i like about chains is i usally know what im getting, but this was horrible.  Ill go back to cpk probbaly just not in an airport."
2,"Steffy has a great Yelp on this place.  And I can definately see it from her perspective.  The problem is, that it really does depend on the day AND the people.  And finding the right mix is very tough.\n\nI have stayed at the Mandalay properties (which by the way - SUCKKKK!!!!) serveral times.  Each time I tried to go to the Moorea area and there was a line for days.  AND, in the line, was 80% dudes.  Now most girls would say - great!  But I am married to a hottie with big , fake chi chi's - and it bites hanging out when my wife is half nekkid in front of the sausage festival.  Completely ruins our time together.\n\nOn the other hand, we went to a party in the evening here.  And let me tell you - we had a blast!  It was the best party we have ever been to.  Very awesome and no single guys!\n\nSo, if you catch this place on a good day, you will have a good time.  Hence, the 3 stars.\n\nOh - and why can't the Mandalay hire good looking THIN girls for cocktail serving?  EVERY girl working there was a huge fat ass."
1,We were so happy to see this place and give it a try.. We went without checking Yelp and now that I have I see several others have had similar experiences.. Fisrt off the food was good--not great --but good.  We sat outside and it took 3 tripsin over almost 25 minutes to get a waitress.. She came out finallt and took our order but ignores the dirty table in from of us.. When we asked for a rag to clean the table she brought one and then started to hand it to us to wipe off the table.. The look n my face probably frightened her and she decided to do it.  There were 3 of us and only one ever received a drink refill.  They were just iced tea and soda.. Two people ordered wings and one a burger.  No napkins.  Had to ask again.  Pretty much that trend continued  through out our time there and so to sum up--Food is OK--Service is VERY bad and they werent even busy.  Probably make another choice from now on and will say thats disappointing.. Had high hopes.
4,"What a surprise, I have driven past many times and never thought to go in well that was a mistake. Went with two others and every ones food was excellent service was the best I've hade in a long time and the price for the quality was spot on. Can't wait for my next visit."
4,"This place is awesome. I got taro and mango flavor yogurt and topped with mochi, black rasberry, and strawberry. It was delicious. Total came out to be around $4. Price is pretty good considering the amount of topping and yogurt that I got. One negative thing is that their yogurt might be considered  a little too sweet, but that's about it. Peach flavor is also pretty good."
0,"Alerted them of a Facebook post where their employee was threatening to assassinate the president. Their response was to block me from their page. Now, because they employ trigger happy employees, I will no longer stay here. Besides, your entire hotel sucks anyway."
0,"I wouldn't even give the Bell Road Mazda Service Dep't ONE star, except thats the only choice I have. I thought I was in good hands, because my mom had been working with Pete since he was at Hyundai when she owned a vehicle with them, and now serviced her Mazda at this dealership where he worked. Well, I took the vehicle in for the oil change in September, to be told the motor mount is cracked BUT covered under warranty. They did not have the part in at that time, but Pete assured me it was covered under warranty and to let him know when I have the time to bring the car back in. No big deal, until I drive away and realize the tech BROKE the Left/Right toggle switch to adjust the side mirrors, and shoved the driver side vent adjuster clean into the dash somehow. I called Pete right away and came back. He peeked his head inside the car and I showed him the issues, and he felt the mirror switch was broken, then manually adjusted the passenger mirror for me so I could drive safely. I did not have another hour & 1/2 to wait for them to fix this, so Pete assured me they would take care of it at my next visit. Here it is December, I have a little time to bring it in, and Pete no longer works there. I explained in detail to John Friedman what happened, thinking the issue would be easily resolved as Pete said. John reached out to Pete, who remembers my mom, remembers me, my last visit with the car, but conveniently DOES NOT remember the switch being broken, the vent adjuster, OR manually adjusting my mirror for me, and did NOT note my account regarding the part # of the cracked motor mount OR TAT IT WAS CRACKED! So basically, I am being called a liar about their tech breaking the switch, AND the motor mount can't be called in until they have the car there, to see which part it is. So there's a good chance I will have to sit there only to be told they don't have the part. And now, I will have to pay for the part their tech broke and who knows about the warranty covering the motor mount since the mileage is drastically different by thousands. THUMBS DOWN. Do NOT expect to be taken care of if they do something wrong. As adults, most of us learn to take responsibility for what we do wrong, and to do a good job at whatever we do-like noting someone's account properly... but not The Chapman Mazda Service Dep't. Now I will be taking my vehicle to the Camelback location from now until I sell the Mazda and wash my hands with the company. Wish me luck... The is why I drive a Volkswagen-they know how to take care of their customers."
1,"I was not impressed with the food and the price.  I ordered mainly sushi, and didn't find it very fresh.  I also ordered an octopus salad, not fresh either, and they put so much sauce on the salad, it was a soggy mess.\n\nOn the positive side, they did have nigori sake, which is somewhat hard to come by.  The service was very good, and I have to admit, the interior had a very nice decor.\n\nSeems like a popular date place, as I noticed about 5 couples."
4,Did a lot of research and talked with a lot of companies and thank God we went with Coyote Blinds. The owner came to the house gave a free estimate with no pressure. Allowed us to take the time we need before we ordered and never went against his word. He followed up and got the shutters to us as he said he would.they are beautiful...\nTalk about great customer service and product. Our shutters are better than what you find at Lowe's or home Depot and for thousands of dollars cheaper. Then the people that installed them were professional and neat and clean. Moved quick but did quality work and cleaned up the area cleaner than when they arrived. They Wiped every shutter down i was so impressed. If your looking to get you windows covered don't call any one else but coyote blinds... thanks again guys!!
2,"Okay, so I like Canteen and all, but dear Lord, let's turn that music down a notch! These guys have a great happy hour, but I realistically wouldn't come here if it weren't for that. I quite enjoy the small bites' baby back ribs - the portions are so small, but since they are half price during happy hour, I get two orders! I'm not a big fan of Tequila, but I know they have a big selection (obviously). I really like the atmosphere here, and the service has always been good. I may or may not come back, but we'll see. Three solid stars from me."
4,"Baguette Cafe is an awesome casual cafe. The owner, Olivier is very friendly and fun to talk to. I go there whenever I am on that side of town. I call it my \""treat\"". Their soups are simply wonderful as are their Panninis."
3,Was it expensive?  Yes.  Was the seafood awesome?  Yes.  Will I go back again and eat more of the amazing food there?  Yes!  Was the service good?  Absolutely.  Definitely talk with the guys behind the oyster bar and find out what they recommend.  I ate some of the best oysters I've ever had at this restaurant.  \nThe salt crusted grilled fish (ask them what they recommend) was killer!\nSave up for a few weeks and enjoy some of the best seafood in Vegas.
2,"I came here yesterday evening at about 5:30 and were the first and only in the restaurant.  I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  \n\nWe were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entr\u00e9e.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  \n\nThe curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.\n\nAs for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  \n\nNot sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.\n\nEat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern)."

1,"Okay so walking in, I expected so much out of this place. I've heard amazing things, and I'm sorry to say this is my first negative review on yelp because of how disappointed I am with Yama Sushi. When we got there the appetizers were amazing.  My boyfriend usually orders about 10 orders of sushi, no problem anywhere else we go. At Yama, he could only manage to order 5 because the service was so bad. Our sushi chef was rude, and very blunt. Not once did he greet us or smile, and he made us feel like we were just another number. He made the guys next to us feel welcome and smiled but when he would turn to us, he gave us another face. I just feel like you should make everyone feel welcome and appreciated, not just your regulars. Then when it came to dessert, I ordered a chocolate mochi. I received a mochi, that seemed like it had been cut with a knife someone else used prior to cut something spicy. So my mochi tasted like it had hot sauce on it. It was gross. That alone makes me question how unsanitary that place must be. All in all, the sushi was below mediocre. I've tasted better sushi almost anywhere else. Sorry to say, I won't be back. :/"
3,"I heard so much hype about this place, I was seriously put off and hesitant to try it. I heard that the vegetarian and vegan options were slim. Plus, the hours are a little early for me, and I just kept missing them. One morning though, pressed to find a vegetarian/vegan brunch in Lawrenceville for a spontaneous brunch date, we sidled up to Coca to be surprised and delighted. \n\nThe wait for a table was less than 5 minutes, even though every table appeared full and it was a Sunday morning at prime brunch hour. Maybe they conjured it up. The space is darling - ground-level store front on Lawrenceville's main drag, bright colors, precious art, so squeaky clean, a well-maintained antique feel. The table service was provided by a series of remarkable people -- they were all quick, inoffensive, practically invisible, but helpful & attentive. I literally cannot remember the last time I paid less than $20 for a meal and felt pampered. \n\nOrdering from the menu, I felt the vegan options were a little sparse, but a vegetarian could have their pick of choices. \n\nAnd then the food arrived! Everything we ordered was scrumptious. Not in the \""satisfactorily good\"" sort of way -- but actually, each bite was a surprising delight. I expected a passable veggie-friendly brunch on a moment's notice, but I was amazed by what actually happened. Tucked into a tiny booth in a back, bright yellow room, my brunch buddy & I marveled at perfect fluffy asparagus omelettes (hers) and a southwest-inspired tofu veggie pico scramble wrapped in a warm tortilla. The tofu scramble was, perhaps, a low spot in the meal. It was good, but I have been spoiled by the finger-lickin' tofu scrambles at other sites. \n\nWhen we left, after stand-up drip coffee and pleasant conversation, we were pleasurably stuffed. My brunch date remarked on what a nice place, what a great neighborhood, and how smart of me to chose such a great spot! This is the mark of a quality dining experience - to elevate yourself & your neighborhood's value in the eyes of a visitor. \n\nCoca, what a pleasant surprise!"
2,"Super pricey! Ridiculously small serving portions!\n\nMy friends raved about this place so we had to check it out.  It is a big place but it gets packed.  So, make reservation.\n\nWe ordered the special crispy duck with panang curry sauce, Thai fried rice, chilli mint catfish, ground pork, chicken curry, and stuffed chicken wings.\n\nThe crispy duck is really really delicious! It is a must try! We did pay $20+ for 6/7 small slices of duck meat tho. \n\nThe spicy chilli catfish was just ok.  It cost us $15 for literally 5/6 small pieces of fish.  The chilli mint ground pork tasted good but the serving portion was so small that we were almost upset.  Seriously, ground pork costs nothing.  Fried rice was good but nothing special.\n\nWe did have the sticky rice and mango dessert.  It is to die for.\n\nOverall, food is decent but prices are not acceptable for Thai food.  I would suggest you go for the Chef's specials such as the crispy duck and beef stew.  They are all over $20 a dish but at least they are special.  Don't order the typical Thai food that you can get it somewhere else at a much cheaper price.\n\nWe probably won't go back because all we really did was loading up on steam rice so we didn't have to leave hungry."

2,"Taco Time is kind of out of the way for most people. In fact the location being inside a truck stop kinda ruins its availability and attractiveness to the stable patron of a fast food restaurant, the family.\n\nMy GF loves this franchise and explains every time we drive by how she grew up eating at one on the west coast.\n\nWe stopped by a few months ago and the food and service was your typical fast food Mexican fare. Nothing there stood out as great and would cause me to desire or crave the dish I had.\n\nLast night the GF begged me to bring her a veggie burrito. I parked and went inside and was surprised to see how many smelly truckers there were. Had to be two or three truckers for every truck outside.\n\nService was fairly quick my GF couldn't find the sunflower seeds in her veggie burrito but it didn't stop her from wolfing it down.\n\nI won't be coming here on my own (more Taco Johns than Taco Bell and I do live across from a taco shop and can walk there) I will be happy to drive down here the next time the GF gets the craving for home/childhood."
3,"I visited the museum with my son and brother. Having grown up in Chicago we had much exposeure to news of the Mob and it's local activities. It was very informative with photos, court documents, evedience. It was worth the 10 dollars for locals, and maybe a little high at 18 for guest to Las Vegas. A good area to have a meal or drink before or after your visit."
0,"Ok, I have to start by telling everyone this - if you were stupid enough to agree to the timeshare presentation, and furthermore, stupid enough to buy the damn thing (like we were) - please know that YOU HAVE 5 DAYS TO GET OUT OF IT!\n\nIt was a terrible experience and ruined my vacation. My vacation that I paid TONS of money for. We were in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend on a whim as I really just needed to relax. This trip was beyond stressful thanks to these horrible people.\n\nA guy (I think his name was Austin) in a booth in front of our hotel (TI) waved us over, asked if we were married (odd - but we are not) and offered us free show tix, etc - we were told we'd be getting a tour of a new resort for the purpose of word of mouth advertising. Had no idea this was a timeshare presentation.\n\n1. They kept us waiting for over an hour in the lobby - I asked whether this hour+ wait time was included in the 2-3 hours we were told we would have to be here in order to receive our \""free\"" gifts. NOPE! Should have demanded a refund and ride back to TI at this point, but we were already there (if you want an upgraded package you pay a bit and are promised tons more stuff)...\n2. They had told us not to eat beforehand as we would be fed lunch as part of the tour. By the time we got there my bf was beyond starving. Buffet at the Silverton was definitely subpar.\n3. Way far away from the strip. Why did I agree to buy this bs again?\n4. Pushy Pushy Pushy! High Pressure. It was hell. \n5. Lots of old people here. Didn't seem very fun to make up for the distance from the strip. Reminded me of a retirement home.\n6. We were there for a total of 8 hours. On Saturday. After a long drive the night before. After being told 2-3 hours. Ended up extending our hotel stay (which was super expensive) just to try to salvage our trip after this.\n7. They pretty much would not let us leave as long as we kept resisting their sales pitches. Why I caved, I will never be able to reconcile with myself...\n8. We had a driver take us back to the hotel at 8pm (on them luckily) as the shuttles had stopped running. I had instant buyer's remorse and vocalized this in the car. THANK GOD for this driver, I'd go back and tip her more if I could - she goes, well, I believe that by law you have 72 hours or something to get out of that. Upon getting back to the room and researching it - YES! You have 5 DAYS according to NV law. There is a cancellation form contained within the contract as well. Hallelujah!\n9. We agreed to a price of I think 11k + 175/year maintenance fees. We found people selling these things on ebay for 2-3k. Yep, definitely cancelling!\n\nGot my refund for the deposit today - thank goodness it wasn't even MORE of a pain.\n\nYou people should be ashamed!\n\nJust remember - YOU HAVE 5 DAYS TO BAIL!"
2,"My mom and I needed to get a last minute appointment for mani & pedi. We hopped on Yelp and saw that his place had a lot of regulars with consistently positive reviews. They were able to squeeze us in within an hour. The place is clean and spacious. The staff were friendly, and they did a good job. The only thing I wish was more communication. My mom and I picked 2 different colors for our hands and feet; however, without asking, they started painting the nails with the wrong color. We went with it anyway because we liked the color. But it would have been nice if they didn't assume, and just ask and check before."
0,"The food was decent, the prices were alright (for Vegas), but the service was TERRIBLE!  If it weren't for the fact that I have moral issues with getting up and leaving without paying (even if we have only had drinks) I would have done it.\nOur waiter not only left halfway through our meal (without telling anyone), but even when he was there, everything (from drink order to drink reception) took at least 20 minutes minimum.  Our food order (which was soups and appetizers) took well over 45 minutes to come out.\nAnother thing... My grandma ordered the tortilla soup, and it looked (and tasted) a lot like the Texas chili.  It just had tortilla strips added.\nI think they are more used to people who are wasted and don't keep track of the normal details that restaurant service requires.  I would NEVER recommend this place, sober or drunk.  But hey, if it's 4:30am and no where else is serving food for your munchies, then it works."
1,"There are too many good places to eat within the same price range for me to give this place a second shot. The staff was friendly and smiley, all the things you expect your hostess and waiter to be when you walk into a restaurant. The decor is nice. There is a beautiful red sculpture in the middle of the dinning room that I really liked. The booths are comfortable with good spacing. You're not sitting on top of the people next to you. They also have a patio that looked nice and an outdoor fireplace. I would sit outside on my next visit except I won't be going back.\n\nThe food was less than awesome. The soup of the day was a really good cream of mushroom. Good consistency, great flavor. The salad was iceberg lettuce with a few cucumber slices and tomato wedges. Pretty standard house salad, decent vinaigrette. From there we split a lobster hoagie  with arugula and paprika remoulade and the pan seared Pacific salmon with wild mushroom risotto. I substituted asparagus for the french fries that come standard with all the burgers/sandwiches. When the plate arrived in front of me, there were only 3 short, fat stalks on my plate which is a shame because I really love veggies.The risotto was the only other item worth mentioning or maybe it's just that I really like mushrooms. Anyway, the risotto was good, but not good enough to make up for everything that the other food lacked.\n\nThe restrooms here are ridiculously small. The door to the stall opens inward so you literally have to step back between the toilet and the wall to pull the door back toward you. Seriously? I was wearing a skirt and the last thing I wanted was to accidentally touch my bare skin to the toilet bowl. The whole outing was not a terrible experience but there is no need for a repeat performance."
1,Have tried it several times for pizza and the pasta and the food is good but the portions were lunch portions at dinner prices
3,"Went there last night for pick up.  I ordered the chicken pad thai, which was great.  Loved how they added bean sprouts and green onions! My girlfriend ordered yellow curry with chicken on stickey rice.  Yup what a great combo.  We also had veggie egg rolls, which are cooked perfectly, not to crispy and not too gooey.  The staff was very nice and will def be going back, and recommend that you try them out if the thai bug strikes!"
1,"We came here because I had a friend visiting from out of town and it was her choice.  i didn't know what to expect, since I hadn't heard too much about it before.  I went on Yelp first to read reviews.  It looked like service was questionable, really just depends on who you got. The food received pretty good reviews, so I decided to roll the dice.  \n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant at first glance.  Looks just like the pictures online.  They were pretty courteous when we first walked in.  She gave us a booth in the back right.  \n\nWe started with the...\n\nMac and Cheese Pops: Mac and Cheese fried in what I can only describe as Corn Dog batter, stuck at the end of the stick.  These were actually pretty tasty, despite my earlier description.  Don't blame me, I go with what I know.\n\nThen off to the main course...\n\nFried Egg Sandwich: This was supposed to come on an English Muffin, but I asked for a croissant instead.  Served with Canadian Bacon aka Ham, white gravy with huge chunks of sausage, and of course... the piece de resistance.. a fried egg, a little over easy, a little over hard.  Accompanied by it's good ole' friend the french fry.\n\nUp next on the menu...\n\nChinese Chicken Salad:  Do not be fooled people.  Items in the mirror may appear larger then they are.  There's a picture on this menu that makes this salad look larger then life.  In reality, it's kind of a small salad.. LOL.. None-the-less, it was pretty good.  I would rather have a little of something good, then a whole heap of something bad!\n\nFor drinks...\n\nI don't really remember the name of mine, but I think it was a Jolly Rancher Martini.  It was tasty.  Definitely, a lot of sugar in these martinis, but I guess that's why you come to the Sugar Factory.  My friend got 2 drinks, but she cannot remember their names, so I decided to leave them off my review.  Let's just assume that they were tasty and sweet.\n\nAt this point, you might be asking yourself... Sounds good so far, why the 2 stars?  And that's a good question.  Nothing I have wrote till now, would justify this low of a rating.  Let me tell you what happened...\n\nPicture it... Sugar Factory, this afternoon, 2014...\n\nThrough all this good food, there was one major issue... the black fly in your chardonnay...  our server...\n \nOur server rushed us the whole time.  We had never been there before and we had questions about the menu, that he couldn't answer.  He spent the whole time moving us right along.  Literally, he wanted us to square the bill while we were still eating.  Really Sugar Factory???  Have a little class.  For how much the food is there, I expect to enjoy the experience... a little.  Turns out, there was a shift change coming, and we know... BECAUSE HE TOLD US. \n\nI know the food was tasty, and I would like to say it was worth the money.  But I am a person that values an experience, and my experience here was not that great.  Sorry Sugar Factory.. The next time I'll see you is only if a visiting tourist kidnaps me and forces me to eat sugar... LOL!!"
2,"For my birthday, the wife planned a trip to try the best pizza in america. We flew in from San Diego on Fri afternoon, immediately went to Pizzeria Bianco at 330pm and was the 3rd group in line. Weather was about 110 degrees, so we acknowledged each other by eye contact, but limited talking or movements. The staff at the bar (opens at 4) was very friendly, provided water and drinks. By the time 5 rolled around, the line was past the bar area. Summary of eats:\n-Antipasto which consisted of wood roasted vegetables (red peppers, mushrooms, fennel, cauliflower, and beets), cheese and Sopressata.\n-Rosa Pizza (Red Onion, Parmigiana Reggiano, Rosemary, Pistachios)\n-WiseGuy Pizza (Carmelized Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage)\n\nConclusion: The antipasto was a pleasant surprise, with the mushroom and fennel being the highlight. We were not a fan of the pizzas. The Rosa pizza was too strong in parmigiana and overpowered the entire pizza. Unless you're a avid fan of parmigiana, I wouldn't order again. The WiseGuy pizza was ok, nothing extraordinary. The fennel sausage had good balance flavor. The pizza dough was good balance and nice char. \n\nConsidering the efforts and reputation, we were definitely expecting alot more. Many warned me that the pizza would not live to the expectation and sadly they are correct. However, we have visited other restaurants with just as much hype and they have delivered above our expectations. Thank goodness Mozza is within driving distance."
4,Awesome burgers!!!!!!!!
2,"Every thing was good the only problem I had was the flank was not up to par, sad thing they will be closing end of the month"
1,"Had the ox tail soup which was very good. The steamed rice was undercooked, service was horrible.  Also had some dim sum which was all very good! Lucky for us the meal was on the house!"
2,"Good, but overpriced. Paid $12 for a pastrami sandwich. It was good, but either needed to be bigger or a few bucks cheaper."
1,"HaHA.  Well, do you want to be transported to bad memories of 1980's architecture?  It's dank, oppressive and from what I saw the rooms are depressing.  The slots are loose from what I've been told on the up side.  Just find the exit in time."
4,"Fellow Meatyelpers,\n\nI cannot emphasize this 5 star rating enough.  I would deduct one star for the lack of actual Brazilian personnel working at this location, but the food was just so good that I forgot about that mundane detail.  \n\nI had seen this restaurant before a couple of years ago and since the opportunity arose once again to try it out, I completely grabbed onto it and went for the meat ride (no homo).\n\nThe location is marvelous, situated in the middle of Tryon's main drag in uptown Charlotte.  When compared to the other Brazilian Rodizio style steakhouses which I have eaten at, this one outshines both in its location (see my reviews for the other two in Orlando, FL).  It is tucked into the lobby of one of the many beautifully designed highrises in Charlotte.  I presume rent must cost an arm and a leg, luckily they use cows for that at Chima.\n\nUpon entering I was immediately taken back by the superb decor of the place.  A large waiting area that is very modern with some light fixtures akin to a 1970s attempt at a futuristic home.  The lobby is slightly elevated which gives you, the guest, a grandiose view of all the meat comas going on in that very special ward known as the dining area.  Smack dab in the middle of the dining area is a very respectable salad bar that in my opinion fell a tad short of expectations.  The upstairs area provides space for a private dining rom and a very nicely set up lounge complete with an awesome bar.  All this can be reached via a mansion style round stairwell or by using the elevator located at the lobby.  This is good for those who cannot walk once done with their meals (refer to my photos for the aforementioned description).\n\nExpect to be treated extra special like a baby in an incubator.  These meat surgeons will take care of all your needs until you are ready to go home to mom.  The servers are extremely courteous and attentive.  You can request any specialty meats that you may have missed out on during your meal and it will be promptly brought to your table.\n\nYou will receive many sides to accompany your meal as well as the salad bar option.  However, you can opt out of the meats and go for a cheaper all you can eat swordfish/salmon and salad bar dinner which will you run you about half of the meat dinner price.  \n\nThe sides consist of Mashed Potatoes, Fried Bananas, Parmesan Cheese Bread, Polenta, Beef Croquettes and a nice spread to put on your bread (see my photos).  Please do not focus on these as you want to have as much room as possible to enjoy the overwhelming amount of meats being served by your friendly neighborhood gaucho.\n\nThe salad bar has plenty of items to choose from along with some brazilian staples such as the Feijoada.  I won't focus on this since it's a salad bar in a STEAKHOUSE.  Vegetarians, hit your browser's back button now.\n\nThe meats that stood out for me were as follows:  The Picanha, Leg of Lamb, Lamb Chops, Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Parmesan Pork, Filet Mignon and Ribs.  Although, all were delicious including the Picanha which is Brazil's prime cut, I have yet to taste better Lamb in my life.  The seasoning on both the Leg of Lamb and Lamb Chops was out of this world delicious (see my photos).  I highly recommend it.  It's so magical, I can't even put it into words.  Think of the best tasting cut of meat you have ever had and multiply that by the highest scientific notation ever and that won't equal the amount of excitement my taste buds had when this work of culinary art touched them.  Pure meat bliss.\n\nI think I have said enough to convince you to at least try their Lamb!  Go here because this place is fantastic.  If you don't have a good dining experience e-mail me personally and I'll paypal you the amount of your dinner in full.  This is my personal guarantee of how much you'll like it.  By the way, if you don't enjoy your dinner, my paypal account is run out of Nigeria, tread lightly when giving me your information.  I'm kidding of course, just disregard the whole refund offer and enjoy your dinner here!\n\nAbracos!"
3,"Okay it's not anything fancy but a family owned take out Chinese. However I love how fast their pickup and delivery is!    And flavor is strong. I eat their Kung pao chicken and ma po tofu every week :)\n\nHot and sour soup is good too. But I especially love their mapo tofu, no meat , very simple but love the flavor :)\n \nThey lose one star as take out Chinese food because sometimes their flavor is not consistent and they always don't put fork when I do delivery but other wise my Togo takeout !"
3,"This is a newer (possibly cleaner) version of Chinatown as compared to other larger cities (and this is speaking from someone who is from the largest, oldest, and established one outside of China, San Francisco).  This is the main one- but a few other community strip malls in the area (more along Spring Mountain) followed years after, so there are more choices for us all. So this ends the conversation about it being \""small.\"" \n\nYears ago, when the 99 Ranch store opened here, I came here quite a bit  for coconut drinks, baked goods, magnolia ice cream, boxed mussels, and thai tea in cans. This store is busy with loyal customers. But, as the years went by, there is a higher asian population here in Las Vegas in general, so naturally, there are more asian stores around town, all over, in fact (so I have not been in 99 Ranch recently). Not like when we moved here two decades ago, there were just a few stores available to us. Anyway, I am a big fan of the bakery to the right of the shopping plaza (sometimes I come here specifically for some asian baked goods), inside the shopping center (more stores inside, trinkets and such), which has a separate entrance BTW. I've also been to some of the restaurants (on two levels), and when that BBQ place opened, my older brother bought food for many family parties (heard that the table service was pretty rude, though). We've been to the jewelry stores, but they are like tourist traps (high prices- avoid them). There is a Kapit Bahay (Filipino) restaurant on the other side (separate from the strip mall, closer to the Spring Mountain side), but I've never been.   \n\nThe parking lot is very busy (so watch out for tour buses). Furthermore, Spring Mountain is a fast paced street, so oncoming traffic sometimes makes it difficult to exit the shopping plaza. And like I said, there are other asian shopping plazas nearby on Spring Mountain, for your asian goods/dining needs."
1,"Let's start with the positives, banh mi and banh xeo were great. The other three dishes we got to sample, not too flavorful. Perhaps because we went at 2:30 pm and it's an off time (still no excuse) but the entr\u00e9e dishes were bland with only 4-5 pieces of meat. Can I get some meat in flavorless sauce with my rice? Shesh.  \n\nPerhaps they should just specialize on banh mi sandwiches. We'll make the drive into town and continue going to Central for better Vietnamese food."
3,"Fuddruckers goes waaaaaaaay back in my line of duty. I grew up in Michigan and had this place as my brothers 5th grade graduation dinner. I'm 23 now, so you know it's been a while. When I found out they were building a Fuddruckers by me, I was beyond ecstatic. It was Fuddrucking awesome!\n\nAnyway, I wanted to review this place after a recent visit with my mother and brother. We came on a Sunday and were not aware that the restaurant closed at 9 PM. We arrived at 8:30 and immediately asked if they were still cooking. You could clearly tell that they were cleaning up and prepping to go home. I used to work in a restaurant and when people would come in so close to closing, I would feel the extreme animosity towards whoever came in.  We said we could leave, but their manager kindly urged us to stay. We placed our orders and they got the food out to use really quick. We had a order of onion rings with a couple of the burgers we got, and they burned them. But not so quick on the hate wagon because they hooked us up with a fresh LARGE order of onion rings on the house.\n\nThe food came out really quick and it didn't feel rushed or sloppy. There weren't employees walking around waiting for us to leave, but we wanted to eat as fast as we could because they were so nice to us. Like 15 minutes before closing people came in and you didn't see anyone look upset, they all happily served each customer and cleaned up what they could. \n\nI appreciated the great service and felt respected as a customer. I didn't feel once as if I was imposing while they were so close to closing up shop. The food here is always great and it's never a disappointment, especially when you are hungry. I would take anyone here as, it does not disappoint. CHEERS!"
4,"Patty's Closet Friggin' rocks, never have I entered any of their locations without being IMMEDIATELY greeted warmly. The stores are clean and FUN and ADORABLE. The staff is always knowledgeable, and helpful in every way. They remember me from past shopping experiences, and are willing to go the extra mile when I am on a mission to find something specific."
3,"Like so many other reviews...... I used to be a Lee's Liquor fan..... now, I am Total Wine and More all the way!!!!\nSelection is INCREDIBLE..... Prices GREAT..... Service is AMAZING.... they really know their stuff..... they have recommended several cabs that were on point! They listen to what you like and guide you in the right direction every time!\nFYI.....Parking sucks..."
0,"Horrible customer service. No respect for customers who aren't locals. \n\nCOMPLETE bias against people who don't look like the typical \""willy street\"" crowd. I.e. Possibly homeless non vaccinated types. \n\nDon't go here unless you want to get judged and not served a drink."
0,"Depressing. Not a good sign. Completely dead on a Saturday night in the middle of Westgate. I get that there are a couple of other choices in westgate but we decided to pop in here. BIG mistake. Their menu is the typical Irish bar fare,  greasy and should've been perfect after a day of drinking. Unfortunately, this was not the case. All we wanted were pretzels. Seeing they had it on their HH menu we assumed we could just order the more expensive plate not at the discounted HH rate. Ummm, no. They won't serve anything that's on their HH menu unless it's HH. The service was poor-my friend preferred to compare them to a smelly bottom body part. We asked them what beer they had on tap and were told \""we have a lot, do you want them to name them ALL?\"" Huh? I'm sorry that we came into your life and inconvenienced you seeing that your only purpose to be in front of us is to serve us and make sure we have a positive experience in your establishment. Clearly, that was too much to ask for at McFaddens. I've never had such a poor experience in my life. \n\nThe food was mediocre and the bathrooms were disgusting.\n\n\nMaybe, this space is cursed. The Other place that was here shut down too. \n\nSeeing all the reviews on here and being at a 1.5 stars should be a sign. Shut your doors and close up all ready."
4,Vape2o is one of my top go to vape shops around town. They carry legit genuine products. Very good people there too. Tom and Ed are very informative and they def know their stuff. Very cool people just to hang out and have a good vape sesh with. They teach all the basic things you need to know. No doubt ill be coming back even just to chill.
0,"The service and ambiance are impeccable, and the drinks were stiff. Although my girlfriend said her cocktail tasted like Pinesol, my Old Fashioned was more straight Makers than crafted cocktail, and for how much it cost, I was cool with that.\n\nThe bad... the food!  How can you charge this much for such average and sub-par seafood?  Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but this was our experience.\n\nOur lobster roll appetizer was some kind of room temp lobster salad - good, but not impressive or exceptional in any way.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the lobster mac and grilled cheese with tomato and soup.  The soup was bland and disappointing and the tiny grilled cheese was stuffed with seemingly the same lobster salad as the appetizer?  As for my plate - the bacon wrapped rainbow trout with white beans mixed with short rib.  Beans were essentially tasteless and the 2 bites of short rib were chewy and overcooked.  \n\nBut worst of all - the aforementioned rainbow trout made me sicker than I've ever been, including both in the US and abroad. Spare you the details, but save your money and pay for an decent meal in Vegas - not the vibe.\n\nOf all the restaurants to choose in Aria and the surrounding area, PLEASE go somewhere, anywhere else."
3,"Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza available in Las Vegas. I always get the DeLite crust, as it reheats much better than the thicker crusts. You get to pick your toppings, and they have a bunch to choose from. The sauce is good, and the toppings always taste fresh. \n\nLook online for coupons before you go. The website always has some, and there is usually one for the DeLite crust. You can call ahead, but it usually only takes a few minutes if you go in to order.\n\nThe reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something. One time, it was the DeLite crust. They stretched the regular crust out instead. They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there, and various other toppings at one point or another.\n\nBut if you are looking for a cheap, tasty pizza and don't mind cooking it yourself, go to Papa Murphys."
3,"Short on time so I will give a simple review.\n\nExcellent food.  Loved the lamb stew.  Wonderful flavor, scent, garnish, visual and most importantly taste.  I will point out that the stew should come with a couple good slices of bread, but when I requested it, it was quickly and cheerfully brought.  The potato cakes were yummy, but did not need the quantity of beans that accompanied.\n\nBeautiful interior and good looking restaurant all the way around.\n\nGood beer selection and our server was knowledgeable of the beer characteristics.\n\nCaitlin was an excellent, attentive, efficient and charming server.  Well done!\n\nPub was fairly busy on a Monday night with a majority twenty something college audience.  What do you expect in a college town?!?!\n\nVery pleased with our experience, and given that there were at least three more items on the menu that I wanted to try...I am looking forward to going back during my time in Phoenix."
0,"The food was excellent and the service was superb ... until we got our bill. We were double-charged for the duck dinner (most expensive on menu). When the waiter came to pick up the check, I handed him the receipt and simply said \""You need to check this again\"". I did not tell him what was wrong with the check; he didn't even look at the receipt and immediately said \""Oh, I'll remove one of the duck dinners\"". He had no more eye-contact.\nI truely believe this waiter was deliberately trying to rip us off. We are above-average tippers, and this is a high-end restaurant. He did not need to do it. I went to the restroom to cool off, I was so annoyed. \nI should have said something to the manager, but I don't want to get people fired."
1,"I have experienced better, actually.\n\nI mean, just walking this place and you can feel something is missing. It for sure needs renovation.\n\nIt's really not fair. This place opened in the 50's and you can tell it's iconic and has had many stars and amazing people walk through it's halls.\n\nHowever, time has clearly passed this place over. The carpets are stained and dirty, the casino feels outdated. Even the shows don't seem to call to me.\n\nI've made a conscientious decision to plant my ass in the hotel where I'm staying at (that's the whole point, right?) throughout my weekend trips; and so I didn't linger anywhere and stayed put here.\n\nUpon check-in, the clerk gave us the wrong room number. We had some girls come with us in a different room and they gave us another horror story of a rude check in clerk.\n\nWhen I tried to watch TV, I kept fiddling around. Found the porn channel and they were charging over $12 to view it. No thanks. Internet porn is free. Thanks.\n\nSo after roaming the casino, I found a bar that seems to be the reason why I gave this place an extra star. $1 beer. That's truly something special to have.\n\nAs for everything else. The food court is dismal and one friend told me the service was horrible at the Indian food place. The Banana Leaf Cafe was horrible as well. I didn't even bother with any of the shows because none of them appealed to me, unfortunately.\n\nThe R Steak restaurant was the only saving grace here as well. The only gem to be found and clearly a reason for you to visit the Riviera.\n\nThe pool was pretty neat, up until I went by the 3-ft area with the stairs to climb out and found a bunch of debris and a floating Corona cup. Not quite cool.\n\nTo make matters worse, my final night I ended up taking a walk towards Encore/Wynn, a hotel who clearly over-shadows the Riviera by a long shot. Upon entrance I can spot a difference IMMEDIATELY. There were so many beautiful women walking around and even if you took that away, you had people walking everywhere, it got so full at one point that we  almost got lost in the midst of it all.\n\nTheir nightclub 'Tryst' has more swag than the whole of the Riviera combined. And I HATE the word Swag.\n\nFinally going back to my hotel in the wee hours and I just felt deflated. No nightclub to speak of, no night-life. Just old folks gambling.\n\nWhich brings me back to my original notion. It's not fair that an older establishment like this should be compared to by other more modern casino's. There is a certain charm to this place that should be absorbed. Unfortunately, in this day and age, I don't think that's enough to stay on par or ahead of the competition."
1,Mixed up order: forgot fries.  Crispy chicken instead of grilled.  Put mayo in sandwich when asked for it on the side.\n\nCash only for drive through but accepted credit when dining in...
4,Every time we come here the owner greets us... we have sake bombs and great food .... the filot minion and spicy chicken are delicious .. come early cause it gets packed !
0,"the service is terrible; the waiters (if you want to call them that) pay no attention to you after you're seated. the food is mediocre, like if I wanted to pay top notch for a plate of bacon and eggs I would have shopped at Whole Foods for the quality and saved me and my friends the hassle of going out to eat. the bathrooms are disgusting, this is my second time being in this place and I don't think that they've been cleaned since they opened. and to top it all off, the owner is an ignorant old man who has no conception of individuality. my friends aren't the polo shirt and boat shoes type, we have tattoos and gauges and we (God forbid) like to wear hoodies. the entire time we were seated this gray haired gentleman was harassing us, making fun of us, calling us names and basically making the whole dining experience uncomfortable. if I wanted this type of service, I would rather have asked the bums that sleep on Smithfield street to make me a hot dog. a one star rating is beyond too much to rate this place"
3,"They gave us the darkest table in the place. But the rita's were flowing and I forgot about it. I had the cuban sandwich. It was great, but I think he lost half of it on the way to the table. It was cut in half. O.K. Who has the rest of my sandwich? Then we went and got a picture taken with the parrots. Woo hoo!"
4,Omg this place is so fun they have great food and shakes i wanted to shimmy to the music
2,"I am a lover of crab legs, and after watching an episode of Bizarre foods, I've always wondered what the fuss about crab claws was. So when I found a stone crab restaurant I was excited to finally get to try it. I had passed this restaurant while in the Caesars Palace. It's not in the actual hotel, but in the adjacent terrace building, so it might be a little hard to find. I made a reservation because in passing I noticed it was a little crowded. Our waiter was friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards. I ordered the Select 6 Florida Stone Crab claws, a side of saut\u00e9ed garlic spinach, and roasted asparagus. There were a lot of extra dishes on the table, and after ordering the waiter decided he was going to reach over me and remove them.... Bad idea!!! The poor guy knocked over my water all over the table... And not so importantly, all over me :( luckily it was just water, and I'm in Vegas having am awesome time, so no biggie!!! Our food came out, and it was pretty amazing. My boyfriend had half a slice of their signature  key lime pie and half a slice cheesecake and his face led me to believe it was nothing short of amazing. My only complaint about this restaurant is that it was filled with tables of rich douchebags who were being extremely rude to the waiters and busboys... Oh and leaving with soaking wet pants :("
0,"Same as the other reviewers: literally the worst service I've ever experienced, anywhere. Note to owner who screamed at me for absolutely no reason: If you're going to mix racks of 'high quality' gowns with racks of overpriced, torn and dirty 'regular vintage', don't blame the customers for simply wanting to look at your merchandise. If you're worried about things falling off of hangers, either move all your special clothes to a separate area, install a sign saying do not touch, or, oh, i dunno, maybe just invest in some proper hangers? WORST STORE EVER. DON'T GO THERE."
1,"Do NOT go here for brunch on Sunday.  It was an uncoordinated disaster.  They messed up our reservation and really had a bad attitude about their mistake.  We asked the bartender for a beer list and he pointed at the chalkboard without speaking and walked away.  Our waitress told us she just woke up and didn't have it together yet.  She was right, she was unprepared to come to work and it showed.  The brunch food was adequate at best.\n\nThe beer selection was great, so that's why it's 2 stars and not 1.  I would consider going back for dinner when they might have their A team working."
3,"Clean, comfortable, spacious rooms. Quiet with a view of 6 bridges! Friendly, polite and helpful staff too. Look forward to staying here again."
4,Authentic Greek food for a small amount of money! Excellent service and great food
0,Crappy service. Came in to order one sandwich. Told me 30 min wait because they are in middle of a big order.  Employees goofing off while making sandwiches. Should have one person working counter orders.
2,"It's a pretty decent value when it's not seafood night.  Dinner for non-seafood night is about $16 after tax with a players card.  An acceptable selection.  It's not fine dining, but it's a good deal for the money.  It's honestly about the same quality as the station and coast casinos but for a few dollars less.\n\nThe Mexican station is full of tacos, enchiladas, and whatnot.  Italian has spaghetti and lasagna.  Meat carving station has prime rib (way too salty) and turkey.  The salad bar has bleu cheese crumbles and bacon chunks.  The beef and broccoli is pretty damn good actually.\n\nFor seafood night, some cold crab legs don't justify the $5 price increase.\n\nDrink refills were prompt.  Waitress was friendly."
3,"We came here just from seeing it on the Yelp app and it happened to have a Yelp check-in offer.  We walked over from New York New York and it was hard to find.  It is not in the Miracle Mile Shops, its on the corner of Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd.  When we found it, it did not look impressive and we looked at the menu for a bit and almost left.  But then we noticed that was the quick take out side and there was a nice restaurant side next door.  So we went to the nice side.  There were only two other tables with customers.  We ordered spagetti and meatballs and a pizza to split.  They bring garlic knots to the table and keep them coming, they were so good!  All the food was great.  With the Yelp offer our bill was $25.  We would probably come back."
4,I went through the fast care at this location and it was great. I was In and Out. The doctors answer all your questions. They are very helpful if you come in with multiple problems. I came in for eczema and also left with an allergy shot.
2,"This is a a good interesting spot.  It's located on Walnut above Pamelas.  I don't recall ever having Peruvian food before, but will definitely try again.  It's a small place where everyone seems to know each other.  The specials change weekly and are a good deal for $10.  The service is friendly and the portions are appropriate.  We started yesterday with sweet patatoe chips (I think) with some type of dip.  It was very good and a nice change for a first course.  I  had the chicken and rice cooked in cilantro which was really good.  The cilantro really gave the dish a crisp fresh flavor.  The limeade was delicious and gave me an appropriate mid afternoon sugar buzz.  It's a good discovery and a unique place to take your out of town guests."
3,"Formerly known as 3 Villages, this is where you can get Xiao Long Bao, other various Chinese Breakfast items, and a much more extended dinner menu.\n\nWarning for those looking for good service, you will likely be waiting.  You will have to flag down the one waitress for water, tea, rice, etc.  We've gotten so use to it that it's now become amusing and it's easy to forgive the cute little waitress girl.\n\nThe best item i've recently discovered is their Lamb Hot Pot - it s about 10-11 dollars and is the best hot pot i've had in town.   Yes it is much better than Booming Mini.  The lamb hot pot is served with enoki mushrooms, tofu, and lots of chinese peppers.  It's got the perfect amount of heat - I recommend to get a little rice on the side to slurp up every drop of soup.  It is that good.  \n\nwe've also ordered a steamed seabass which was less than 20 bucks - easily the best value for steamed fish i ve had on spring mtn.\n\nDespite slow service, 1900 delivers.  The last few times we ve visited we were one of a few tables present so i hope 1900 stays around. Take my advice and get the lamb hotpot!"
1,"Everything about this place is amazing. Yet the security staff is horrible enough to take 3 full stars off my review. If you see a purple jacket, walk the other way before you start getting harassed. (exceptions are Bruno, Daryl, Devon and a few additional gems, only need 1 hand to count them all.)"
0,"This nail shop was one of the worst experiences I've ever had and I've been getting my nails done since I was 15. Initially , I got a gel manicure because I am trying to go natural. Needless to say my nails are very weak and thin at this time since I recently removed the artificial nails. When I walked into the salon I was greeted and helped immediately. The nail tech proceeded to start the manicure however she didn't do much if any cuticle care or massaging. Basically their manicure is like a lengthy polish change. Little to no care for the actual nails. I chose my gel polish and everything LOOKED good. About 4 days after the gel manicure the polish began to peel. I went back to the shop where they only fixed the ones peeling. I explained to the nail tech that I wasn't happy with the brand of gel polish ( something called Gel 2) and wished to change brands to the OPI which is what I'm used to. I was told I would have to pay 20 dollars in order to have a full polish change which I felt was unfair because I just paid 30 dollars 4 days ago. The nail tech continued to just paint over the ones that were peeling. Well two days later new ones and recently 'fixed' ones began to peel again. I went back to the salon and spoke with the manager who I just knew would make this right. I showed her what happened and she tried to tell me gel polish does this sometimes. I explained to her that I was just there two days ago and I again asked if I could switch brands because I wasn't impressed with the Gel 2 polish. She says to do a polish change would be 20 dollars and that takes too long. I asked if she could just redo them all using the same polish then she again complains it'll take too long and she just fixed the peeling ones. She proceeds to soak off the peeling polish then finishes the pedicure already in progress as she speaks to another nail tech in Vietnamese. I can tell she's talking about me then in English says it told her it would take too long. I chime in a remind her I paid for a gel manicure which hasn't lasted and as a business and owner she needed to make it right. The same nail tech that did the screwed up job just two days ago comes in and speaks to the owner about my situation. He looks then the lets me know this is the last time they will fix my nails. And proceeded to scrap my nails to hurry the polish off. I told him it hurt and to stop. And they are right as I will not be returning. I've said all this to  say this place only cares about money and not their customers or correcting a mistake they've made. Do not waste your money or time here. You'll be sorry!"
2,"Good food in a great atmosphere in Old Montreal. As a first-timer to Montreal, I had to try poutine. I ordered the poutine with smoked meat and found it surprisingly delicious. The portion size is large enough for two and I shared a few bites with my family. Everyone enjoyed it. \n\nWe sat on the busy back terrace and the service was excellent. We never felt rushed and our food came out quickly. Sure, it's touristy, but it's worth a visit."
4,"This place was great!  The food was superb, the staff was really on point even to the point of cleaning up the crumbs that were on our table.  The food was delicious and not extremely overpriced (esp for Vegas).  We managed to get some patte and corned beef on the cusp of breakfast/lunch.  Our waiter managed to sneak us in.  \n\nHowever, the greatest perk of this restaurant is that it is right in front of the Belagio.  The fountain wasn't working when I was there, but I can imagine it going off while you're eating your meal."
0,"I don't like this bank.  Not happy with their hours, their website, bill paying service, or especially their mobile app.  They are the biggest bank in Las Vegas, but their technology is pathetic.  The only reason I have an account there is because I used to use Wachovia, which I loved.  They swallowed them like Pac-Man and they inherited my account.  I continue to use them for one reason only:  they are one of the few banks with branches close by that have safe deposit boxes.  Otherwise, I'd be out of there in a heartbeat."
3,Okay... so they do have Haribo Roulettes! Yay! I just went when they were out of stock was all. Now I can roll out the gummy fruit goodness like I did as a child standing outside a candy truck.
4,"Hands down, the best Indian food in Las Vegas!!!!! \nBeing a Las Vegas resident and having eaten Indian food across the world, I can honestly say that India Masala is an absolute winner.  The interior is plush, comfortable, clean, and well built.  From the moment you walk in, you feel that you are transported for a dining experience half a world away.  I think what knocks out the competition are the unique and flavorful spices.  Spices I have never tasted before.  The entree melts in your mouth and wanting more and more.  The menu has everything you could ask for in an Indian restaurant, and the service was top notch.  I was also shocked at the outstanding prices.  Basically, I cant wait until I have the chance to eat there again!  Recommend for any occasion without hesitation!"
4,"My parents are from italy and we take them every time they come to AZ.  The food is from their province in Italy and they love it!  In fact, my parents will not eat at Italian restaraunts normally because they are usually disappointed - not here.  We are going tonight!"
0,This place is no longer in business. Sad to see it go.
2,Cheesecake Factory is always a great go to place when you have several mouths to feed and you don't want to drive around to find a place to eat.\n\nThis CF is well outside of the strip area of Las Vegas and is frequented by the locals from the Green Valley area.  We came here early on a Sat. afternoon (4-ish) and the place wasn't crowded at all.\n\nService was a tad bit slow at first but with a little prodding (and departures by other tables) our waitress picked up the pace.\n\nFor a party of 8 we were all pleased with our staple dishes ranging from Mexican to Asian to American fare.
4,"Lauren Marler is the best cut & colorist I've ever had. I've had people who butchered my hair & nearly killed it completely, but every time I've tried someone else I've always gone back to Lauren because she has been the only one who brought my hair \""back to life.\"" She is truly an expert in her field & anyone would be lucky to have her as their hair dresser. I refer all my friends, family, & co-workers to her & no one has ever been disappointed. She's the best there is. Trust me, go to her, you won't be sorry! Plus, she is a MASTER w/ reds & red-heads! And that is hard to find! I know cuz I've looked.\nLiz S."
2,"I come for the corn cake.  When Chi Chis went under I mourned the loss of my dearly departed friend, the corn cake.  Then, a couple of years ago, we stop in here for an only slightly extended work lunch, and all of a sudden 'Reunited' is playing in the background as the corn cake arrives at my table.\n\nI can't even tell you what entree I order.  It's good, but, like, OK good.  My only request to my waiter is 'bring corn cake, sub all sides for corn cake... corn cake!'  One time I had a waiter bring more corn cake then entree.  I told him I loved him and left a hefty tip.\n\nOoh, I just remembered something I get.  Corn cake (kidding).  There's a build your own combo, and one of the items is a chicken flauta with a jalapeno jelly sauce.  That sauce is awesome."
0,"Worst place I've eaten in Vegas.\n\nThe service was beyond terrible.  Ordered, got bread 10 min later, after finishing the bread, 10 min later the oil/basalmic was set down ion the table.  20 min in we got the first apology that we hadn't gotten our SALADS yet.  Were offered another drink and some more bread.  Bread that never came.  Caprese salad with under-ripe tomatos.  Mmmmm.  Frozen bag broccoli as a side.  Spaghetti with meat sauce......burned?  Yep, i know the taste, texture and color of a burned sauce, having done it at home more than once.  Difference is, I throw it out and start over.\n\nI would rather eat at a gas station mini-mart than come back here."
4,"I've been coming here for breakfast every time I am in Vegas. The food is delicious but the coffee is magical. It's smooth and rich, and as is the case in a few, rare places doesn't require sugar.\n\nThe selection of Benedicts is fantastic, the croissant sandwich is to die for and the egg white omelets taste amazing.\n\nThe staff is attentive and friendly, the service is excellent and the decor is authentic and quite lovely."
1,"We did not stay here... thank goodness!  It is crowded and hot and loud and a drunk group of travelers.\n\nWe came to visit the Vue bar.  The outside patio is small with very few tables.  However, if you can snag a table over looking the Freemont Street it is a great place for a $3.25 cocktail.\n\nWe did stay and play some penny slots.  Came out even and had fun for a few minutes.\n\nWould not go out of my way in the least to visit this hotel OR casino."
4,All I know is. The Hubs and I were hungry so I yelped a burger joint in PHX. I was all Bae this place has 254 reviews .. Let's go there ! We were in PHX from Prescott for the day. Got the Teriyaki Burger Rocket size and fries ! delishioursh ! Hit The Spot ! The owner even chased us to the parking lot to make sure we enjoyed our Food  Yay!!!!!
2,"Over priced ice cream shop.  Sorry, it's good but then again it's no different from Baskins or Coldstone.  They have real food, not just desserts.  I suggest just eating but skip the dessert and get yourself a cheaper ice cream."
2,"If you're looking for a restaurant hotspot in Old Town, look no further.  The Mission offers up gourmet latin-inspired creations in a dimly-lit, totally chic setting, with decor reminiscent of its days as a pueblo church.  We went on a Saturday night, and it was a good thing I made a reservation - the place was PACKED!  The bar was packed, the tables were packed, even the aisles were packed!   \n\nTo eat:\n\n*Crispy Cola Pork - Tasty, but seemed more asian than latin-inspired.  Close your eyes and you might think you're eating an extra-sweet teriyaki lettuce wrap.\n\n*Duck Empanadas w/ Foie - Pass on this one.  The foie was strangely spongy and the empanada crust was very tough and mealy.  Filling was bland.  All around fail.\n\n*Mahi Mahi Tacos - $14 gets you two lipstick-sized tacos with nothing on the side.  Same goes for all the taco dishes.  Very bad value.\n\n*Shortrib Asado Negro - Meat was tender and flavorful, and there was a decent portion of it.  But there was hardly any garnish to cut it - maybe 4 small bites worth.  Why skimp on black beans, plantains, and rice that cost next to nothing?  Silly.\n\n*Espresso Churros - Delicious!  My favorite part was the milkshake - Perfectly smooth and coffee-y.  However, the main component of this dish is supposed to be the churros and for some reason there were only a few small sticks of those.\n\nConclusion: The Mission has an awesome-sounding menu, but most of the actual dishes fall short.  Portions are generally very scant and uneven across menu items, so be sure to ask your server about what to expect.  The food is basically good for noshing while enjoying several cocktails, looking hot, mingling, and enjoying the upbeat vibe!"
1,"In town for just a few days, we came here for a Saturday breakfast, based on the recommendation of a friend (and former Phoenix resident). After we finally got a parking spot, and navigated the crowded interior... Perhaps we had high expectations, but we were really disappointed. We wanted to like it. We really wanted to like it. We were told to come back to the counter to get our food in 10 minutes. It was definitely longer than 10 minutes. While the orange juice was really great, it was unfortunately the best part of the meal. When the food was finally ready, the french pancakes seemed to have the potential to be amazing, but they were kind of cold and ended up just ok. The commuter sandwich, though good, was very oily. All in all, maybe we didn't order well, or maybe we didn't order enough, but we left pretty unsatisfied. As far as we are concerned, not good value, and not worth the chaos."
1,"Great service, but everthing else was just ok. I had the pancakes, which were huge and tasted like they were made 2 days ago. My family agreed that I make better ones. My son had the French Toast - he didn't like it. The restaurant is very small but cozy and family friendly. Too bad the food was just average and there are other better choices around."
2,Closer to my house than Cafe Solo but it's a little claustrophobic inside. The star rating is for the espresso. It was okay but not the true experience of espresso where the aroma of coffee fills one's entire mouth and nose upon each sip. My guess is that their machine does not generate enough pressure to extract the really delicate flavor components. Seems that folks in Tempe are just fine with $tarbux though so the owners may be excused for complying with market demand.\n\nStaff was nice but untrained on the day I visited. If this place were on my way to work I would probably be a regular here.
2,"If you're into loud music, lasers, and hookah Cloud 9 is a destination to attend. Make sure you're at least 18 years of age though; they ID.  A cost a hookah is 17$ and 9$ for an additional refill bowl. Its a bit on the costly side, but if you're searching for a good time its worth it."
3,"I made reservations via opentable the morning before we dined. Easy and we were seated immediately upon arrival.\n\nService was a bit slow. We didn't feel any connection from either the server or the server assistant. The bread service was below basic, especially for a fine dining restaurant. We asked the server for his favorite and most popular cocktails. We ordered both: sisos sexy and another that I do not know the name of. He wasn't present on the floor as much as I'd hoped. \n\nMy friend ordered the bacon wrapped filet and thought it was delicious. It was one of her favorite filets in all time. I ordered the organic salmon which was delicious as well. The sauce on both the dishes really made up the entrees. The salmon came with noodles and vegetables that really complimented the salmon. Two entrees that you cannot go wrong with.\n\nOur reservation was at 6:15pm and we sat to see the sunset. It was gorgeous. Definitely come around this time to see the sun set. \n\nLastly, compliments to the maitre d' or manager who made his table touches and really looked like he was enjoying each conversation with the guests. He complimented us on our smiles and we told him we came out to see one of the top 39 restaurants with a view in the world. He said they must be doing something right. \n\nI would say this wasn't my favorite fine dining restaurants but it definitely is something to cross off my bucket list. Good for special occasions."
3,Went for the first time on a work lunch and got there early enough to avoid the line. Veggie bowl with Tofu was great. Super friendly and enthusiastic staff. Wish id' known about the ramen but was totally new to the place. Will go back.
1,"MUy poquita comida !!!! Ped\u00ed un Chichen bowl y solamente ven\u00edan 4 pedacitos de los q vienen en una ensalada!!! Pague $6 lo que me cuesta un pollo entero ya cocido en la tienda ... Que verg\u00fcenza , que decepci\u00f3n  !!!"
3,I didn't like the fact I couldn't valet park for the event I saw (PBR). The arena sound and events were great. We had a great view of the show. The vendors are major rip offs. I got a vodka tonic and it was $20. Beers pretty high too. We didn't even eat the crap food cause it was so much money. The seats were so small it was awkward when a lady sat next to me. Elbow to elbow. And we are ladies... Some bigger ladies and men would have a hard time sitting in these seats. Overall though enjoyed the event and would return.
1,"LOVE the staff and atmosphere of the store. HATE the food. I don't mind paying $8.00 for a burger and fries, but when the burger is at most maybe a quarter pound of beef with a huge piece of dry lettuce on top and very hard fries, you I think you can get the picture. Its too bad because Im a 50s kind of guy and if it was good I would be here constantly, unfortunately that's not the case."
1,"Went here for a girlfriends birthday on Saturday with a large group.  Need to preface this with that statement because it is difficult to get a large group all on the same page.  Some of the group was more interested in the football game in the bar, people having conversations etc.  Our waiter came by initially to take drink orders and let us know that he would be taking care of our table.  When he came back to the table we let him know that they could break down our table because two people were not going to show up.  He displayed visible irritation.  There must have been some kind of confusion because the waiter must have been waiting for the rest of our group to return from watching the football game at the bar before taking our appetizer or dinner order.  We could see that he was getting very irritated with our table so we ordered about 4 or 5 appetizers and more drinks.  And I do recall telling him that the people at the bar will probably not come back till the game is over.  My girlfriend then said to the waiter that we were very sorry and to please not be irritated with us because we had been there a hour and not ordered dinner yet.   He looked at her and said in a very nasty voice that this was how he made his money.... \nWe were stunned that he said that to us.  There was a dead silence at our table.  We were aware of what was going on with our table and would have treated him very well.  Once he said that I had no interest in increasing our tab for his benefit.  I was already full from all the appetizers so I decided not to order a entree and neither did the rest of the table.  \nI have been here before and have had a enjoyable time... I don't know if the waiter was having a bad day or what.  Not acceptable customer service!"
3,"I LOVE this place.  Its a very chill atmosphere and good customer service.  I'd recommend sitting at the bar but the tables are still good. We always stop here on our Vegas trips and I don't see that changing any time soon.  I've never needed a reservation here, you're sat quickly and your food comes out fast.\n\nI only come here for the all you can eat sushi, and for $25 a person why would you get anything else?!  The sushi is fresh, tastes good, comes out fast, and there's no limit.    This place is well worth your money considering 3 rolls anywhere else would already cost about $25+ and the cost of all the other buffet/all-you-can-eat places in Vegas.  I'm not going to say its the best sushi I've ever had (although the first time i was here it was definitely on the top of the list), but it's well worth the money and time.  I'll be coming back again :)"
4,"We recently had Hank and The Green Goat come and do a massive weed removal and pre-emergent service - and the quality of service and results could not have been better.  We went from the worst looking yard to the best in the neighborhood in just a few hours. \n\nHank responded to my request for a quote within a day and set up a time he could swing by to give a quote - I had several other companies including AMS also give us a quote, but Hank's was the most competitive for the level of service I had heard they perform. And they didn't let us down.\n\nWe will be using The Green Goat for any future landscaping needs and recommend them to everyone."
4,This place is super cool in a geeky way. There is a ton of equipment that you can use if you join for a monthly fee. I went to an open house type of event and was really impressed by the different types of machinery they had. The 3D printers are neat and they have screen printing. They also have a ton of other things I wish I knew how to use :(
1,"Very disappointed! Not the healthy cafe they advertise themselves to be. Hardly anything fresh on the menu. Just the same tired over cooked food, with too much white flour and sugar. I asked for the Avocado & Grapefruit Salad, since it was the only fresh item on the menu. Wanting less sugar in my diet, I asked if they could make it heavy on the avocado. Our server said, \""No. That would mean we would need to open a new avocado, and we're trying not to make any mistakes in the kitchen today.\"" Really. Even though we live across the street, and would LOVE to support a good new restaurant, we won't be back."
1,"I went here based on the yelp reviews and the 3 dollar signs thinking that meant expensive but not absurd. \n\nMy co worker and I went for dinner and we walked in and they asked if we has reservations. The place was empty so I didn't see why that mattered. We said no and then they asked for my last name and then first. I was so put off. I don't see a need to give out that info to have dinner. Do you want to do a background check as well?\n\nWe were sat by our hostess dressed in a slutty black outfit, like the others there. Out waitress attempted to say hi by using my last name I gave them which isnt all that hard but she slaughtered it. She asked if we wanted wine but we told her no and that we wanted water, coke and lemonade. She ignored what we said and then asked if we wanted water and soda... ugh. \n\nWe were in shock when we opened the menu and saw the ridiculous prices. $45 for the filet by itself, with no sides. $10 for a baked potatoe....We were here on money from work so we stayed. If it was my own money I would not have stayed. We ordered our meal and out waitress again was clueless and ignored what we said and had to repeat our orders several times. \n\nThe food was brought out and I was expecting the most amazing steak I have ever had. The steak was fine, not worth $45, maybe 20. The baked potato was pretty decent but again not worth the money. I dont know how they can charge that much for mediocre steak. I ate everything but wasnt all that pleased. \n\nMy low rating is due to the strange vibe I got from the staff and the crazy high prices for standard food."
2,"Another OK restaurant week experience. Slow service and mediocre food. Lots of great reviews and I'll definitely try again, but my recent visit, which was my first wad just OK. The summary...no seasoning! A little salt & pepper goes a long way. Had the scallop app and the lamb shank entree. Potential was there, but bland was the result. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try again, ad I'm sure, based in the reviews, it was just an off night which everyone has."
2,Starting my beautiful Saturday morning at the DMV...not the way to go. Yelp and door hours state they open today at 8am. I was here at 7:45 and the place was open with almost half was occupied. They serve now by your phone number vs a numbered ticket. I don't know if I like that because I can't tell how many people are ahead of me.
2,"This review is for the buffet. Typical buffet food. I had saag, bombay potatoes, tandoori chicken, curry chicken and pakoras. I think they must leave out the spices for the buffet in case first timers come in. The saag was good, but it wasn't anything special. Bombay potatoes were just meh, This was however, the first Indian buffet I have been to where the tandoori chicken was not dry as a bone. It was actually juicy. Props for keeping the bones in the curry chicken, although there seemed to be more bone than meat. And the pakoras, bleh. \n\nI ordered a roti and a parantha. It was the weirdest roti I had ever seen. I am going to agree with Dean-Ryan S and say it looked like a mix of roti and naan. It wasn't horrible though. The parantha on the other hand was dry and almost burned. \n\nI was there by myself and the young guy and older woman were both very friendly. At first the guy was making conversation with me keeping me entertained but then he went in the back. \n\nI'd return perhaps for dinner. But since I don't live here I doubt that will happen."
0,"I wish I could review the Megabus, but we did not get what we paid for.. We where to catch the 3:45pm out of Las Vegas to Los Angeles, there was a line for the 3:15pm out of Los Angeles as well.. so we stood behind those people.. the Megabus which looked awesome quickly filled up and they even took some people from our 3:45 to get on the 3:15pm.. Okay they left.. I got excited since we had planned where to sit and I could recharge my laptop and use the wifi... well here's it went to caca.. We didn't get a Megabus.. we got a simple plain boring bus, with no working air, no working lights, no toilet paper, no wifi, no movie, no plugs.. NOTHING!!!! I paid for the Megabus experience and I did  not get that....but I'm sure I will have another opportunity since my mother is making sure we get what we paid for and getting either a refund back or tickets for a future time. \n\nThe one thing I will say about the bus ride, was that it was safe, smooth and we got home 30 minutes ahead of schedule.. but when all you can do is sleep on the bus, it tends to go by fast."
0,"A sporadic text message from my friend had me wondering what to have for lunch. Before I could figure it out, he was already ready to go. So I turned on the GPS on my phone, and found a place nearby on Yelp. I really hesitated to go here, and was so close to insisting on Chipotle instead. However, I figured I would give NYPD another shot.\n\nI rarely leave food unfinished, even if its mediocre. But the wings that came with the lunch special were so bad that I just could not finish them. If there wasn't any hot sauce, I probably would have vomited. Did they decide to just take week old wings and serve them? I am incredibly disappointed. I seriously have never had wings as bad as NYPD's in my entire life.\n\nThe pizza slice was ok, but seriously why bother selling stuff that is just plain terrible? I'm really going to hesitate coming back here. In fact, I probably wouldn't come here even if a friend invited me for lunch and paid for it. One of my worst experiences ever."
0,"After too many chances that I have given this establishment to provide fresh quality food and to get my order right, I have decided to never support this poorly managed place ever again.  \n\nSave your money, try Old School Pizzeria directly across from the Cannery.  It's a bit of a drive for me but my family and I deserve quality food made with fresh ingredients and care.  Try Old School Pizzeria, you will not be disappointed."
3,Nice mom and pop restaurant with friendly service. The frybread with grilled chicken mojito was delicious -- the topics did not take away from the flavor or texture of the frybread.\n\nIt was a nice find.
1,"It was ok. The Drunken Noodles had too much green bell pepper, which is an inexpensive common vegetable that I didn't know was cooked so much in Asian food. David Wong's Fried Rice was a dollar more than what the restaurant's website indicated. The hard menu an online menu aren't the same price wise in it's entirety."
3,"Super friendly staff, good prices, and I've heard rave reviews of the live entertainment they get.  Wish they had a menu, but it's just a little place."
3,"I'm surprised at the negative food reviews, since I had a really positive experience at this restaurant.\n\nWhen we got to the Bellagio, there was a line for the restaurant, but menus were posted so you could read while you waited. And the person in charge of the line was very efficient at seating people.\n\nWhen we got our table, two of us immediately ordered ridiculous cocktails called White Tigers that might not have technically gone with the Chinese food we ordered, but were nonetheless delightful.\n\nOne of the people in our group ordered the pad thai dish people were slagging, and we both liked it. I tell you this, friends, having eaten some pad thai in my day.\n\nMy dish was a bean curd with mushrooms and bok choy which is exactly up my alley, especially since it came with white rice that I could just ignore and so had a fighting chance of finishing my food. (The people that order noodles will need to share or take some home.) \n\nThe bean curd (like fried tofu pieces) and shiitake mushrooms were great, and they cooked the bok choy like you're supposed to, so they're still tender-crisp instead of being overcooked into little puddles of limp green sadness.\n\nAfter my cocktail I ordered coffee, which might have been The Best Cups Of Coffee I've Ever Had. I wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the day. \n\nConsidering we're talking about Las Vegas, the prices were typical. Maybe we made lucky food choices, but we enjoyed ourselves!"
3,"So, a bunch of guys from work and I went to go check this place out for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was good and the lady at the counter was friendly. \n\nI had the Italian Sub and a drink, which was about average price ($8 and change). The sub was above average but I regretted  not getting the 2 slices of pizza and salad. Their salad bar looked good and for $6 and change, they got that deal with a drink. If you are going here for lunch, I would have to recommend going that route. \n\nNo one in our group had any real complaints and the meet lovers pizza looked fantastic. I know I will go back just to give that a try."
3,I've only been here a couple of times with some friends. It's pretty convenient along with the three other theaters within less of a mile. But I like it because it's next to the TGIF. It does feel kinda deserted. I feel like I hardly see the people that work here. Other than that the movies are good and the seats are coo too.
0,"I am absolutely STUNNED that this place such great reviews.  These people must not go to a lot of piano bars.  As a performer myself, and a musician who goes to a lot of these places, I feel like I have a good handle of what makes a good piano bar.\n\nWhen we got there there were two ladies playing.  Their piano skills were great (probably better than mine) but their singing was more like screaming.  Thankfully, I only had to listen to them scream for about two songs before they changed out for two guys.\n\nBUT, the men weren't much better, as they complained about every request they got.  It was obvious they were more about making tips and not actually entertaining the crowd.\n\nHere's how it went:\nThey would get a request, and play about 10 measures of it, and then they would vamp it and talk about how \""no one really wants to hear this song right?!\"" and keep playing the chords until they got money for a new request.  Now I know exactly what they're doing because song wars are a great way to get tips, but where I come from if someone pays you $20 to hear a song, they deserve to have the whole song played for them.\n\nBy the way, if you're a piano performer, don't complain that every night someone requests Piano Man.  THATS JUST THE WAY IT IS!\n\nStill in shock about the grand reviews about this place."
3,"I went in with two other guys and noticed that the name of the place is actually Fresh 'n Fast now. There were just a handful of people despite it being lunch time. I ended up ordering the black bean burger and a fruit cup. The place might have fresh food, but it certainly was not fast. The black bean burger was pretty tasty though. It was a little spicy, which was a nice twist.\n\nThe fruit cup included watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, and strawberries. All but the strawberries were good."
2,"LOVE the firefly but the extra drive to paradise will be much better served. The kids who staff this location are slow, uninterested, inefficient, and inattentive.  For tapas style dining especially, that kinda ruins the experience. Poor management sense; poorly run business."
4,Excellent food.  The flavors and combinations that Chef Silvana puts together are unique and really tasty.  Our favorite waiter is Hugo so ask to sit at his table.  Be prepared to wait and know that it is completely worth it.  If you need to use the restroom just be prepared for a unique experience.  To describe it here would take away from the experience.  Again the food is the best gourmet Mexican I. Town and the tequila selection is incredible.  Enjoy!!!
1,Very authentic?! There was even a faint resentment towards people without exact change and those who did not speak French.
1,"this is supposed to be the \""world's greatest handburgers\""\ni wasn't pleased. \n\nso i came here thinking it was a sit down restaurant, and boy was i wrong. \nyou walk in through the doors, and wait in line. when it's your turn, you order. \nand ordering is a hassle. maybe i'm too asian to figure out how to freaking order a burger, but i thought it was a bit challenging. \nthen they give you a buzzer thingy that lights up. \nnow you have to find a place to sit. \nOH MY GOSH, what a pain! you have to stake out a table and try to anticipate who's going to be done with their meal first and jump on it. \nwhen your food is ready, you go up to get it, and then you have to put your own lettece and tomato on it. [it's kinda like a buffet line] i give them extra kudos for making sure it was fresh, because the veggies DID look very very very fresh. \nthen you finally sit down and get to eat. not in peace though, because others are waiting for your table. \n\ni ended up paying $10 for a 1/3lb burger and wedges. they charged me extra for my grilled onions and guac. \ni think it's WAYYYYY overpriced for all the hassle i had to go through. you don't even pay that much at a sit down restaurant. \n\nyeah, the burgers were good, i guess. but i would never go back. \nmight as well go to IN-n-OUT and enjoy my meal for under $5 [which includes a drink]"
0,"Nightmare! Rented from this facility through Priceline for a fair price...$136 for one week. When I realized my car would not be fixed within the specified time, I called a day later and told them....they said not a problem, keep it as long as necessary. I ended up at the end of a 18 day period with a $2,218.00 bill; which I am still disputing. Even though the agent TOLD me my daily rate was $23 a day for every day over, I did not READ the fine print stating it was actually $90; not what she SAID. Thank GOD, for American Express who is helping me fight this issue. No one in their right mind would pay $90 a day for a compact car. They are a shady car company who is loosing their ground to companies like Alamo and Hertz, so take advantage of consumers who don't bother to read the fine print when renting through Hotwire and Priceline. Completely fraudulant."
0,"Terrible service, The only.white guy there totally messed up my head with a nasty part look. terrible"
4,"Small little gem tucked in the back of the shopping center.  Obviously the selection isn't as big as Guitar Center, but the quality is much better.  Nice staff, good prices, highly recommend."
0,"Don't go here if you like to have conversations with your friends during dinner. Don't go if you don't like paying fairly high prices for hit and miss food. And do NOT go here if you want friendly service. The service either ends up great, or crap. And to be honest I think the people who work there take thier attitudes from the owner. He just gets ruder and more arrogant (and more drug addled) as the years go by, won't be comming here... EVER again."
4,I have visited STACK many times over the years and every time I go back I feel it gets better! You will not find a better burger in Las Vegas! Their steak is unbelievable in quality and taste. Every dish you have is made with care and the staff is great. All staff is knowledgeable about everything they have on the menu including their specialty drinks (which are all good). I just came home after being in Las Vegas for a week and I ate at STACK three times while I was there. I can't wait to go back in July and visit again!
3,"7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great.... \n\nAll dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup... \nits new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P \n\nwalks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K... \n\nAs soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :) \n\nthe lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?! \n\nin the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed... \n\nas soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said \""Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?\"" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? \""um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... \"" he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird \n\nhe got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score! \n\nonce we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing... \nhe had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli... \n\nso the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm \n\nthen he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!? \n\nonce we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying \""pardon me or excuse me\"" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified! \n\nEnd Result.... \n\nGood Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :) \nThe Service was nice... \nNice atmosphere... \nHorrible date... \nWish i had had better company :( \n\noh and i Tossed out his number..."
1,"I only go to the way overpriced Whole Foods because i'm Vegan and they have a great selection of Vegan products there that I can't get anywhere else.  That's where the second star comes from- otherwise I would only give that place one.  Is it just me or are all the people who cashier there extremely rude?  They always make me feel like i'm some kind of super loser that they are so much better than if I don't bring my own recyclable grocery bags everytime... and today the cashier accused me of lying about soup!  I put some soup in a soup container and at checkout the guy asked me if it was soup or food.  I thought he was joking and I said, \""It looked like soup to me!\""  Then he asked me if he could open it.  I was beweildered but I said, \""Sure, of course.\""  He opened it and I asked, \""Does it look like soup to you?\"" He replied, \""No.\""  There was no way anyone could possible mistaken the runny mess inside for something other than soup.  So then I started trying to tell him what it was called... some turnip lentil something or another... and he cut me off and said, \""I don't need to know what it was called.\""  And then he charged me for some soup.  Really?  You couldn't just admit you made a mistake?  You had to be that rude about it?  Is this the best Whole Foods can do with the training of their staff on customer service?  I usually prefer the Whole Foods on Las Vegas Blvd. but I still get some of the same attitude there too.  Wish we had an Earth Fare Grocery store here in Las Vegas instead!"
4,"I love TJ's!  I need to watch my salt intake & they have the best selection of low-sodium or no added salt food products (I can't even find this much stuff at Whole Foods)!  My faves are the no salt added marinara/spaghetti sauce, unsalted tortilla chips, no salt taco shells, and their peach pops!  On top of that, their prices are reasonable compared to Whole Foods.  The cashiers are also very friendly!"
2,"Listen, there's no way a used goods store could ever achieve 5 stars, sorry, but the stuff is USED! \n\nI would say that on a used goods scale, a set of 3 stars is pretty close to fantastic. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with recycled clothing, and smart people recognize this. From work pants to Halloween Costumes, this place has it all. I've purchased awesome clutch bags, hardly warn NAME BRAND boots, and crappy photos with cool frames that I've turned into a high-fashion design elements for my apartment. \n\nWhere else can you purchase 15 items and spend $25??? \n\nIt's good people, let down your snob-guard and give it a whirl! No one has to know where you got it and how much you spent ;)"
0,"Wish I'd read the previous reviews before I came here.  A horrible, frustrating, waste of time experience trying to get our RV water heater replaced.  Parts were screwed up resulting in a week's delay, and I had to actually find the part number for them to reorder the part.  Parts were literally double the price of other sources.  I never received most of the calls they promised and getting information was like pulling teeth.  When the reordered part did finally arrive they failed to schedule my RV in the shop and the SERVICE MANAGER refused to come out and meet with me to discuss the situation.  I waited some time and he never appeared, just kept sending out excuses (the general manager did eventually fix the situation, more or less.)  Took 10 days for a 3 day repair and when we finally got so angry we just left the water heater still did not function.  6 Camping World techs worked on it for 5 hours and couldn't get it working.  (A couple of days later a 1 man repair shop in another town diagnosed it and repaired it in under 5 minutes.)  On the plus side they did provide us with a parking spot in their lot, saving us campground costs.  Unfortunately the promised shore power connection never materialized.  Go ANYWHERE else to get your RV worked on."
2,"Good food, slow kitchen.\n\nAfter probably two dozen meals at Red White and Brew in Mesa, I think I can finally write an objective review.\nFood quality is pretty good overall. They make an effort to add creativity and include a few healthy options and good seafood specials. The complimentary garlic bread is great, and the bar service is some of the best I've come across. Bartenders are friendly, efficient, and most importantly, knowledgeable about their offerings. \nAs a New Yorker, I have struggled to find good pizza in AZ, and didn't expect much of the RWB pizza. I must admit I was stunned at how good it is. Still not NY style (it doesnt try to be), but easily the best in east Mesa.\n\nMy biggest reason for detracting two stars is the speed of takeout service. Recently, I called ahead. It was slow; they estimated 15 minutes for 2 salads. I showed up and waited, and waited. 33 minutes later they were ready, and it was chilled, pre-cooked chicken on there! With that type of wait over twice the estimate, we will think twice if we have time constraints going forward. That has happened a few times. \n\nIf the service improves going forward I'll update, because I'd love to have some five star non chain restaurants in Mesa..."
4,"On the morning of my half marathon, I walked passed Pinks!! All I could think about during my torturous 13.1 miles was...\""Please God let that be the same Pinks from LA!!\""\n\nLet's be honest...it's Pinks!....you can't order and not be satisfied with it! Greatest part.....NO LINE!! Although I'm sure the longer they are open, more people will sprint their way on in...and if they don't...then I feel bad that they could not experience the wholesome goodness of a Pinks dog engulfed in BBQ sauce, oozing over with chili and covered in cheese and onions!"
1,Late night Madison is tough when you are hungry.  I saw that this dive bar was packed the night before so we stopped in on a Sunday evening.  The few patrons in the bar were playing metal at full volume.  We all had the Packer Burger which was a big MEH.  Not the worst place I have ever been but I have been to some dumps.  I would not seek the Packer Inn out in the future.
0,"Their Pad Thai was one of the worst I've ever had. It was bland, dry, and cost $10! Although their serving size was descent, I hardly ate any of it. Hot sauce wasn't even able to help save this dish. Very disappointing."
1,"Ehhh.....it was ok. Quesadilla was ok......Carne Asada burrito my daughter had was down right aweful. Queso dip was good. I doubt I'll be back. GREAT service tho, very attentive and polite waitress."
2,"I stayed at the Tahiti Village as a regular hotel guest.  We stayed at the Moorea suite which I found to be quite non-functional.  It doesn't have a table or a desk, making hard both to eat a meal with your family or use your laptop.  The single sink has barely any counter space around it, so there is no room for all your toiletries.  And the design of the room with a single window in the bedroom and none in the living room, makes for a very dark suite.  Cheeful it was not.\n\nOn the plus side, the pools are great (if you have children).  They are both very chyild friendly, heated (the pool too much) and with free toys (noodles in the pool, tubes in the lazy river).  There are lots of kids, few drunken twenty-somethings and lots of space for fun.\n\nWe're staying now at the Signature suites at the MGM, and I feel this is a better value. Our suite is smaller, but so much nicer and well designed!!  I think from now on we'll just stay at the Signature."
1,I know good thai curry and this was far from it. Service was very good.
3,Food was pretty good. I feel that the drinks were a little pricey for what you got but I come from NYC where those prices are normal. \n\nThey were absolutely amazing with our little one. Very attentive and quick service. Nicely decorated. The next time we get a craving for some enchiladas we will go back!
4,"Fun place to hang out, good wait staff, good music (if you like the 80s and 90s music) and a fun time!  AND, there's no cover!  I would much rather come to hang out in this lounge than wait for an hour in line and pay $50 to get into those other over-rated clubs throughout Vegas.  Will definitely be back next trip to Vegas!  Also, the wait staff was good in helping us try to locate a lost item in the lounge..they were genuinely concerned.  We found what we were looking for..thanks!"
1,"If you do come here just sit at the bar top. Otherwise forget about getting decent service.  \n\nI do frequent here often as it's a decent sports bar very close to my home.  Like I mentioned my friends and I usually only sit at the bar top. Beer is ice cold and not a bad place to watch some games.  \n\nThe food is your typical sub par bar food.  They have your blah nachos, hamburgers and what not.  Just \""meh\"" all the around as far as food quality and options.  \n\nSo, go for beer and sports, sit at bar top and you'll leave happy-ish..."
4,"Update:  We returned three years later and found that this restaurant is unchanged...really good.  Came for lunch and I had musels and linguini.  There was a choice of sauces.  I had butter and garlic sauce.  Delicious.\nBut wait!! There's more!!  My wife and I had soup which comes with the lunch meal.  The soup was a rice and lemon soup.  It also had diced carrots and celery in it and it was superb.  \nWife had for her lunch, sausage with peppers and onions.  She was very pleased with hers.\nService was superb.  \nPrices were very reasonable.\nWe've already decided to come back again....the problem is who do we want to come with us that we can introduce them to this little jem."
4,Alexanders my favorite spot while in town!!! Family run business offers EXCELLENT SERVICE!!\nHad veal parmiganna with fettuccini alfredo and was absolutely amazing!! Cant wait to go back!!
2,I'm in agreement with most of Stevey P's review.  The lobby sales were akward and it was unclear about how it related to the theater.  I liked the stage and the set for the production I saw was amazing.  The direction was also very good and the small cast was used very creatively.  I enjoyed the faux-golden age of theater feel.  It was true to Phoenix architecture:  a soutwestern reprise of high cultures from european civilizations (Have a look at Gammage auditorium if you don't believe that there is a trend emerging in the Valley)\nI thought the acting was a little jilted in the production I saw... and I don't think it was due strictly to the British-affect the actors adopted.
1,"Came here today to see if I could find some last minute things for Thanksgiving. I don't have a problem with (most of) the products they sell, but man! Talk about grumpy workers!! I bought some canned food for a food drive and the girl that checked me out today was banging the stuff down on the counter. Never cracked a smile. I guess that's what you expect when you shop at the 99 cent store. I'm gonna go drown my sorrows in a Dutch Bros coffee - at least THEY seem to actually LIKE their job."
3,"I have to be honest with everyone out there.  I did you all a disservice and I beg for your forgiveness.  I love this place!  I gave it ONE star before to keep it all to myself.  Heeheeheee.  I swear that is the only time I have stretched the true as a Yelper.  \n\nOther than that, look passed the whole Buffalo theme and see the place for what it is.  It is a hole in the wall gem with great specials and bartenders.  Brad is just about the nicest guy on Earth.  If you want to know who Brad is, just look for the Hulk size bartender and then you've found him.  \n\nOne \""must do\"" about Town Tavern:  The Town Tavern Challenge!  That would be 5 shots in 5 mins.  Don't be fooled and think that is easy.  You havent heard what shots you have drink yet.  I will leave that as a surprise.  All you need to know is that you get a free t-shirt and your name engraved on a little plaque on the wall.  Look for 1SIMMB1.. That would be me!!  \n\nStop in and enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
3,"We were with a group of 10 guys here for diner tonight and everybody liked whatever they ordered. I had the Carne Seca Machaca and it was really good. Guy sitting next to me had Carne Adobada, a large pork steak, marinated and grilled, it was very good.  My friend across from ordered a combination of tamale and taco, he liked it a lot. Their salsa is hot, but oh so tasty. The margaritas were excellent. The restaurant has been there for almost 40 years and if they keep serving this kind of food, they will be around for another 40."
2,"I went here for a night of blues dancing a little while back and enjoyed myself. I didn't get a chance to really taste the food, but I can tell you about the their other wonders. I was surprised by the beer selection here. Deu de Ciel? Yes please! What I also liked was the spacious dance floor, which is lacking at other blues events. \n\nThe big down side was the atmosphere, which is not as classy compared to other blues venues."
2,"i like fresh and easy.  I guess its kinda a more generic version of trader joes, which is better, but F&E is better than most places and since its right across the street from me ill give it 3 stars.\n\nNever eat the sushi though!  BLECH!!"
2,"We decided on having the chicken.  I'm assuming most people go for the steak but I'm a sucker for good chicken and I figured this place would be a hit.  We were so disappointed.   The chicken was very dry.  It came with mashed potatoes that were nothing spectacular, just home made.  It also came with two spears of asparagus that were cooked well but bland.  We both commented that I could have made a better dinner at home.  I didn't come to Vegas to spend so much on chicken that I could have done better myself.  I was so bummed out.  We did have the scallops as an appetizer and they were pretty good on their own.  The mix that came with it had dry old bacon bits in it.  So I guess my only advice is don't bother with the chicken unless you are looking for a dried out home cooked meal arranged all fancy on a big plate.  I will say however, the service there was excellent and I give that part 5 stars."
0,Looked like a very nice place to eat so we thought we would check it out one night. All was fine until we got our food. I ordered filet mignon well done because that's how I always like my steak and a friend ordered a steak as well only medium well. Well we both got our steaks and they were very rare and blood was pouring out when we cut into them. Disgusting! I sent mine back and when it came back out to me it was charred so bad I couldn't eat the outside of it. They need to get a better chef!
2,"Didn't I just walk out of the cupcake place and buy a whole 26 dollars worth of Cupcakes. That's actually 6 with a special decor. My Uncle was in the hopsickle up the street and we both have to have sweets. So I came on a mission. The place is kinda weird to get to. Its a matter of driving around and looking for it in the plaza. \nWhen I walked in it was one guy working...but only one customer. I decided on a 6 pack halloween style with lil ducks that were in costumes as my accessory. You get to pick different flavor cupcakes, different flavor fillings, then toppings, then accessories. I don't mind it but if there were more people there I'd be hella annoyed. But here I am...UHHHMMMMMMMM Let me get red velvet withhhh.......Uhmmmm Hmmm Vanil....no wait uhm...butter cream.......uh no I dunno....\nOK when people have choices it makes it harder. Believe me from tending bar it SUCKS. So of course what do you do? Just agree with everything. I finally finished after 15-20 minutes of deciding. SUCKED ASS. Ok so there goes my precious time :) \nThe cupcakes themselves weren't bad. Nice Moisture and the fillings were great. But I'm not down with the price....So obviously I'm knocking it because time's are tough. Not really into it being so expensive :("
2,"If you are looking for a good fresh cooked hot dog, or sausage, this is the place to go! They cook the meat while you are waiting in line, which I thought was pretty cool. It was actually kind of intimidating at first, if you don't know what to do.\nThe sausage was good, although pleas note that 1 is more than enough!\nThe fries and onion rings are good too! \n\nIf you're ever in the area and want a good hotdog or sausage, stop by Ted's!"
4,"i love the beautiful decor~~\nif you want to have a nice chit-chat with a friends, perfect spot!\n-drinks hit the spot!\n-very chill and relaxing\n-very close to marquee"
2,"It's good but on my third visit I was not impressed. I felt the fish to rice ratio was not too good, tiny slice of fish with too much rice. Slow service. I just wanted to place all my order at once but the waitress said it was too much food. Which I assured her Ive been there before and that's how much I eat.  So had to break down the order into 3 orders and had long waits in between. Only plus they do half roll orders so you can try more."
3,Breakfast is GREAT!!!  Pancakes and French Toast AMAZING !! Service is GREAT.. Im going up in a week
2,It does take a while to get seated. We waited for about 25 mins or so. There is a lot of people around 6pm. The interesting thing is that they have these people who walk on those wooden thingys that make them really tall and they make balloon animals and stuff. We stayed long enough to see the volcano erupt with margarita and there's this girl that slides down into a cup filled with margarita. She does a little dance. The volcano nachos were really good! we asked for more guacamole and it was free. We also had the coconut fried shrimp with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It was okay. The shrimp was fried too crispy and hard. The veggies were too soft. The mashed potatoes was the only good thing. I didn't get to try the drinks here though. The atmosphere here is a bit too noisy for me and my bf.
1,So after a long flight I was excited to have my first Starbucks of the day I was quite disappointed as the credit card system was down I could not use my app. To add misery to wallow the toaster didn't work thus no toasted bagel. Just a bad experience I'm sure it is not always this way as I was leaving I was hoping for a saving grace but my thank you was as sad from the clerk as was my total experience
0,"5th time going to Layers, bad service every time. (employees act like they'd rather be anywhere else)\nFood is good, but not worth the cost you pay for portion size on most dishes. \nSadly disappointed."
3,"My 2nd trip ever to Las Vegas (March 2012) I stayed at the MGM Signature and I LOVED it. My first trip ever I stayed at the Cosmopolitan across the Strip so I didn't want too much of a \""fall off\"" in terms of luxury and amenities for my 2nd foray into Vegas. I was pleasantly surprised that the fall off was very minimal if at all. Fantastic suites (I opted for the junior suite but got to tour a balcony suite with the really cool big screen LCD TVs that pop out of the desk like a robot. My suite was huge and it felt more like an apartment than it did a hotel room. That may be because the Signature rooms are actually condos and hence are treated much better by MGM. The only drawbacks of staying at the MGM Signature is the fact you have a 10 minute walk to the closest restaurant over in the MGM itself but it's a short 10 minute walk, especially if you take the people mover. I was battling a cold during this trip as well so I did a LOT of sleeping and I was never disturbed or wakened by drunken Vegas debauchery. The pool was quiet, a complete polar opposite of the MGM pool which is simply mass chaos. If you are looking for the fun of vegas but a quiet hotel stay this is a great option. Two pieces of advice for anyone booking a room here: 1, book through MGM itself and NOT the property manager that rents out these rooms/condos. If you rent through the property manager housekeeping will NEVER show up and you'll be living in your own garbage and filth for your entire stay. I know this to be true from my neighbor who I heard complaining about it. 2, avoid taking the back exit to the 3rd Signature tower to walk up Harmon to get to the Strip. It actually takes you longer to walk that way than to simply walk through the MGM to get to the Strip. It is a haul and if it's hot out you're going to be sweating up bullets LOL. I HIGHLY recommend this place and will likely stay here for my next trip."
0,"These guys are always on point with their sandwiches. My husband and I come here on a regular basis. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. Today's visit however left somewhat a 'bad taste' in my mouth. Not because of the food mind you but because of our cashier- Jennifer.. My husband and I are heavily tattooed, with that being said people will ask us about tattoo's and even try to get quotes on tattoo's. We don't mind this what we do mind is when people like Jennifer show us tattoo work on them from scratchers/ kitchen magicians- these are people who tattoo illegally out of their homes!! Not only is this illegal bit it's not safe! So it really gets me worked up when they think the work they got done is good and when they think my husband charges too much money. He works for a very well know established tattoo shop. Typically when people tattoo out if their home there's a reason for this. They suck!\nI just thought this was very unprofessional and honestly she may have hepatitis from getting tattooed in someone's kitchen so we will not be returning to this location! Good luck Jennifer with your shitty tattoo's & scratcher artist."
3,"This place has been doing it right for a very long time. Back in the day, there were only 3 bar stools inside, and a waiter in town could trade thier \""This is not a check\"" paycheck for a cold beer. The tacos are killer and that hot sauce is freakin' nuts. Love it."
4,Got a beautiful very lightly used mint condition Coach purse last night!\nThe price was awesome and the owners Natasha and Marlina were stellar!!!\nMy lady absolutely loves it!! But she doesn't need to know I got it for a fraction of retail or even eBay! If your in the market for high end boutique couture this is the place for you. Great selection awesome prices and great customer service!!
2,"It's just a burger(I had turkey)...made to order, which is a little different for fast-food. \n\nEither than that I see no difference from Nations, Mickey D's, Burger King etc.\n\nYea I'll suggest it, but it won't be my first choice."
0,"When I was younger, I had a huge crush on David Copperfield.  I don't know why, I just did - maybe something about those eyes...  I watched every TV special he did.  It was must see TV back then.\n\nCut to years later, I'm so excited to finally see him in person!  David Copperfield Live!  Wow!  I walked through those double doors, and my heart dropped at the tiny size of that theater.  Uh oh... not good.\nThen David came on.  Same black slacks, white t-shirt, and open denim shirt that he wore on his last TV special.  But it was David Copperfield, so I sat back and tried to enjoy my drink (two drink minimum) as the show began.\n\nWell, since I had seen his last special on TV, I realized that now I had just paid to see it again, only live.  What the?!  He couldn't come up with something new?  Even the part of him finding some 'audience member's' father and reuniting them on the beach - saw it on TV.  Same script.\n\nI was so disappointed.  I was a fan for almost 20 years - and then to be brought to reality like this?  And you know what?  I've never seen a less enthusiastic performance by someone who just pocketed $200 from us alone.  David did not want to be there.  He was just going through the dialog and the motions.  No wonder they put him in that small theater."
0,"We arrived, on a Saturday night, with one host, one waitress, one cook working. It took over 3 minutes before the host appeared to seat us, almost 5 minutes before our waitress arrived to take our order, they were out of some of the items we wanted. About 20 minutes after we ordered, we asked about our food, since people who arrived after us had been served; the waitress had lost her sheet with our order and couldn't quite remember it, so she had put in what she thought it was, but wasn't sure if it was right, but didn't think to come and ask us to verify. We told the waitress we were now in quite a hurry, since we had already been there almost a half hour and had only planned an hour for our meal. She just said that it was \""her fault\"" and said she would make sure they had started our food. It's now ten minutes later and we are still waiting, and contemplating just getting up and leaving since they obviously do not care about customers, service, or actually making money. I would recommend you go anywhere else. Seriously....I've had better service at a 7-11."
2,"The food tastes great here, but I probably won't eat here again.  Why?  First of all, the food selection was comparatively small.  Most Indian buffets I've been to simply have more options.  Next, it's not the most flattering facility.  It seems a bit dingy.  Finally, they gouge you on the price.  $10 for a lunch buffet is just too much, considering you can go a mile down the road to Pasand for $2-$3 less."
0,"Second visit Great patio but so many damn flies- and it's been like that for months- seriously need a fly trap- in my beer, food, all over the tables- disgusting."
2,Nice fields. Best time to be coaching/playing in the games is either first thing in the morning or late at night after 7p. During the day its hard to even concentrate with the weather at 110'+.
2,"Excellent breakfast spot! Vast menu--almost too many choices--with plenty of vegetarian options. Large portions, and everyone's dish came with a healthy serving of fresh fruit. I had the veggie benedict. Good choice with the grilled tomatoes and fresh avocado, although my eggs were a bit overdone. The home fries are amazing though! Crispy and great seasoning. The bottomless coffee wasn't that great, but good enough for a bottomless pot to wake you up in the morning.\n\nService was incredible! Fast, attentive, friendly. I wish I could remember our waitress's name to give her a 5-star review. The service is definitely what would keep me coming back. The food is good, but the pricing was a bit high (I think bennie + coffee came to $14 + tip) to make it a regular go-to breakfast."
4,"Stopped in yesterday because a new position I have taken doesn't take kindly to my teal hair. So, I needed something to wear to work. Matt was exceptionally helpful in showing me options, I was especially indecisive and had no idea where to start, but after a few min. Matt had me in the right direction and I picked an awesome wig!"
4,"Tamba offers a lunch buffet on the weekends that is quite satisfying.  Plenty of choice, including salad-y stuff, entrees, desserts, and plenty to satisfy either vegetarians or meat-eaters in your party.  It was all very good, especially the vegetable curry I tried.  The staff is helpful, the dining room is nice.  The only thing that would have improved the experience for me would be 1. being hungrier and 2. labels on the buffet choices (the staff were happy to answer our questions about any of the food, however).\n\n#2 is a perennial complaint I have with Indian buffets... I like Indian food immensely and would like to learn more about it so I can remember what I especially like.  But all of the Indian places I frequent are label-less, so except for stuff that's easy to identify like curry, I am left describing things as \""that green goopy thing\"" and \""that orange goopy thing\"" and \""that other thing with the lamb\""."
2,"Beautiful place in a great location. \n\nPros: Clean\n           Nice design\n           Serve Illy\n           Have some food and pastry options\n           Outdoor seating\n\nCons: Expensive (anytime you charge more than Starbucks, you are         pushing it)\n            Slow\n            Employees need some training in friendliness\n            Not open late\n            Risk life and limb pulling in off Eastern ave"
3,"I was looking for a place to catch a bball game. I usually goto Four Peaks but this was closer and less busy. The atmosphere is great with pool tables in the bar and flat screens on every wall. The service was great! Drinks were on the cheap after 8pm every day with a revolving selection of  food specials. I decided to order the fish and chips since I was craving them. The fries were soggy and not very good. I was hoping for thicker cut and crispy. The onion rings were very good though, light and crispy. Fish had a little too much batter but was still crispy. Not the best fish and chips but still hit the spot for me, especially with a nice pint. I really like the neighborhood feel to this place and I would definitely come back for drinks. I'd try the green chile cheese burger next time, I've heard good things!"
1,"Bootleggers, I WANTED to love you. I did. And you made me sad face. \n\nFirst, the meat is amazing. Flavorful and melt in your mouth amazing. But you cannot get a 5 star review based on the virtue of your meat alone, and your spotty service and incomplete meal prove that you think otherwise. \n\nThe bartender did not know what kind of beer, IPA specifically, that was even on tap. Dogfishhead IPA...great, which one sir? Very disappointing.  The PBLT, which is described as Pork Belly, Lettuce, and Tomato was absent the Tomato. I was going to mention this to the bartender/server but he NEVER reappeared.  Our uncleared dishes sat on our table for 20 minutes or more while the bartender/server flirted with two chicks sitting at the bar.  I had to get up and ask the hostesses (multiple hostesses, why? You only need one Bootleggers) who were dancing, singing, and folding napkins to get me a box for my remaining food. \n\nAll around very disappointing experience, and although your meat is divine, I will not be providing Bootleggers any further business.  Once you get your service straightened out you could be a top notch restaurant."
2,"This place reminds me of a small town restaurant, yet this was in a casino. Decent price, good service. Can't say much about the food because I had a chicken salad, but hey it was good."
3,"Started poorly but everything went better and better as the food got out!\n\nI booked a table just for myself during a business trip. Got there a few minutes ahead of schedule and the hostess tried to seat me at the bar (\""are you sure you want a table?\""). Yes, I want a table to eat properly!\n\nFinally got a table, towards the back of the restaurant in an area that they were setting up with more tables. Felt like they seated me in the middle of the backstage.\n\nI went for the prix fixe menu: salad, 16Oz steak with sauce and two sides and desert. All with bottomless wine pairing. I asked for the dressing to be on the side and no sauce on the steak. I thought the waiter was about to scream and kick me out. He clearly did not like special requests...\n\nAnyways, the food came out and was great. The somelier was kind and explained his wine choices. \n\nOverall an increadible meal value and awesome food quality. I wish the hostess and the waiter were up to par :)"
0,"Overall I had a pretty poor experience with this venue. The staff seemed to cater to the \""regulars\"" which seemed to just be the friends of who was working there. I found myself waiting for extended periods of time for service. When I was finally able to receive service the staff was very brief and more concerned with what their friends were up to.\n\n I would not recommend this place. I was able to get a cheap Corona this Thursday night but I had to deal with an incredibly uncomfortable atmosphere. I would say it's a much better idea to take your money to Four Peaks or one of the better reviewed bars off Mill Ave."
3,"I honestly can't tell if this business started up as a passion project or someone's idea of the funniest way to rip off the rich and convince them that they were being trendy.\n\nI'm always fighting an internal battle when it comes to Sprinkles. While they're ultimately VERY tasty and definitely the best cupcakes I've ever had, I still find myself thinking, \""I'm paying that much for six cupcakes? Really?\"" I've been eating they're cupcakes since a few years back when I lived in LA and these were the new \""in\"" thing in Beverly Hills. It's no surprise that their first move out of CA was to Scottsdale and besides In-N-Out, it's one of the best imported franchises they have to offer.\n\nTo be honest, as far as flavors go, you can't really go wrong with anything you pick here. They're super rich, so really think about if you want just two or a dozen. It makes sense as to why they give you a fork a knife to eat these things.\n\nWhen it really boils down to it, Sprinkles is a guilty pleasure. By picking up an order here and enjoying it, you feel like you should be at a party with the kind of people that dress their chihuahuas in juicy couture hoodies and drink only beverages that some how include hand picked wheat grass from Bali. On the other hand, the cupcakes are so good that you decide to suck it up and savor the taste."
3,"The new Arby's beef gyros were really good. Of course its not the real gyro meat, but the tzatziki sauce makes it taste like the real thing.  Service was quick. Will come back again."
0,"Countertop Horror, part II, so last night the countertop company calls about my countertop being ready to install.  Seems that the douche bags at Home Depot, Queen Creek, dont care about their vendors, either.  After I cancelled, the order after being treated like crap, they further bungled the job not letting them know about the cancellation and manufactured my countertop anyway.  The company told me Home Depot was going to \""eat. it\""  It would have been so much easier if they had made things right, smiled, been polite and just helped me, but all management are as stupid and degrading as their spawn employees! And their lies caught up with them!"
0,"This should say it all: we found a dress we loved, it was in our price range, but...we didn't return because of the customer service\n\nI suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress, but we just didn't want that negative experience to taint our wedding. It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth, very accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren't ready to buy the dress, it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We're talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn't say no, we didn't say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren't ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy, and just wanted to think about it one more time. It's a purchase that costs thousands of dollars; shouldn't you as the bride be able to take your time?\n\nAnne Gregory is probably the only shop in town worth going to for higher-end, couture dresses. But we've been to nice boutiques across the country and this was the only one that gave us the huffy attitude you historically associate with those types of places. Disappointing.\n\nA few practical notes:\n- They don't allow pictures. Some shops do, some shops don't.\n- I think there's a private lot but if you end up parking in the strip mall parking lot next door or on the street, the spaces are metered so bring your quarters.\n- always judge for yourself...to get a sense of their collection you can go to their facebook page and see what dresses they've actually sold. take care not to confuse the posts they make of other wedding dresses and pictures of dresses by actual customers."
3,"Salle de spectacle/bar qui appartient \u00e0 ses travailleurs, les Katacombes est une coop qui offre une belle exp\u00e9rience pour une soir\u00e9e de sortie. Je n'y ai \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'une fois la semaine derni\u00e8re pour voir le band \""Mise en Demeure\"" et l'ambiance \u00e9tait incroyable.

Malgr\u00e9 cela, l'ambiance, la sono et le service nous ont fait passer une soir\u00e9e tout \u00e0 fait sensationnelle. Un grand plus est que les Katacombes servent uniquement des bi\u00e8res de micro-brasseries, incluant la bi\u00e8re noire de McAuslan (une de mes favorites) ce qui est exceptionnel dans ce genre de salle et ce, \u00e0 prix raisonnable."
0,"This was the first time I had ever gone to an eye exam myself. I went and was told to fill out paper work and then was given a form. The girl said \""You don't need to read it. Just go ahead and sign.\"" So I signed the paper and waited to go back. After all was said and done, the doctor, Linda Bayerkohler, said she was going to put me in a Toric lens. I just assumed it was a brand. They then tried to get me to spend another $45 or $50 to take some picture of my eye that lets them see behind it. I told them no and that's when the doctor got rude. So I paid $110, which I felt was pretty high for an evaluation, but I paid anyways. I get home to find out that I was charged most of that because of the special contact this doctor put me in. I call the office, absolutely livid. That was when I was told that I have an astigmatism and that I have to wear special lenses which is why I was charged such an outrageous amount. I became even more angry because I wasn't told I needed a special lens. I wasn't even told I had an astigmatism until I called to complain! They then promised they would get me a 3 or 4 months of contacts for free, but the manager would have to order them first. She told me she'd call me back. 2 months later, she still has yet to contact me and every time I call and ask for her, I am hung up on. I can't leave messages and emailing the company has gotten me no where. I am SO past livid with these people and this company.\n\nThese people are not concerned with the health of your eye nor are they concerned with your happiness. They're only concerned with making money and being complete rip-offs. AVOID THIS PLACE"
3,Great hotel.  Super clean.   Very good price.
1,"Decided to give these guys another try, hoping that the customer service at this location was better than the Signal Butte store. I really don't have a problem with the job they do, just the customer service at the Signal Butte location is HORRIBLE! Went to pick up my clothes from this location and low and behold, two of the employees from Signal Butte were there! Oh well, the search for a new drycleaner is on!"
3,"This is my favorite place to stay while in Vegas. The casino isn't extra smoky like many other hotels and even though it's small it's nice! The Hark Rock is close to the strip but its not ON the strip, which i appreciate because i don't want to be smack dab in the middle of all the commotion! All the rooms are nice.. except the lowest type. Do yourself a favor, if you stay here stay in one of the upgraded rooms, even if its just one step higher, its worth it! \n\nAlthough I love the hard rock I took off a star because the pool is closed most of the year and beware, DONT TOUCH ANYTHING INSIDE THE FRIDGE... there are sensors underneath every item.. if you move it you buy it.. they even make you sign something to agree to this when you check in!"
1,"I wish I could give 2.5 stars.  \n\nJim G. and I frequented this place when it was Enoteca San Marco.  Even when we previously enjoyed this place, we recognized that this was a snacks, wine, dessert kind of place.  We were never blown away by the dinner plates.  Now, with the change, things seem to have gotten worse.\n\nWe started with a salad we had loved before, the Buratta Pesto Caprese.  The cheese is excellent, as are the pine nuts.  The pesto was lacking and the tomatoes were stewed instead of fresh! What?!?! Weird.\n\nWe also shared some Verdure: Olives (plentiful dish of olives), Lentils Alla Toscana (always solid), and Eggplant Caponata (decent).  Our server had to use a rolodex looking device to explain the Caponata to us. She better have been new; she was slow, inattentive, and not too bright.\n\nWe shared a pasta and a pizza.  Both bleh! We had the Rigatoni with Pork Belly and Swiss Chard, and cheese.  How is it possible that this dish has no flavor whatsoever?!?!  One of the most boring dishes ever. What a waste!  We also shared the Sausage and Peppers pizza.  Terrible.  It says Pizzeria in the name!  Sausage was bland, pizza was apparently salt free, and the sauce was flavorless.  Waste of time.\n\nI did not expect fine dining here, but damn, this was disappointing.  Usually Batali places offer a minimum of quality.  Otto is sad. Too pricey for such mediocre food and service."
3,"So I read every review of this place on here before I went to Vegas [[for the first time btw]]...and I really wasnt worried that i'd have the same concerns as some of the other peeps on here. And i was right. Ive stayed in some pretty crappy hotels, including one with bullet holes in the ceiling in San Jose. I just wanted a cheap room and so I went ahead and booked here. I stayed in a Tower room on the 15th floor...Ocean view...and the views were spectacular. We were facing the strip and had views of Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Tropicana, Excalibur, New York New York and MGM among the others scattered about through there. As far as the room goes it was very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. My comforter had major issues tho...the batting inside was all bunched up and weird. The bathroom was nice and I did keep in mind all the other reviews that said there were drainage problems, and yes our sink did drain slow on the day i left. Oh, I guess I should have stated that I stayed here for 2 nights. Anywho the one sole reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because theres no refrigerator or microwave. grrrrrrrr! \n\nNow as far as the rest of the place goes...ladies beware: the Hooters girls do not like it when you are hotter than them. and guys beware: I saw maybe 1 hot Hooters girl the entire time i was here. I ate in the resturant, played in the casino, drank at the bars and eww....my husband commented that more guys were checking me out than them. and they noticed and they were RUDE. anyways...i noticed a lot of people bitching about how the free $100 promotional slot play was a \""scam\""...umm its only a scam if you PAY something....is free people who cares!!! me and my husband both played and yeah we burned through that $100 in about 2 minutes..but i didnt give a crap I didnt pay anything...I just signed up for the Owl Rewards Club so whatever. If you dont wanna waste 2 minutes dont frickin play. Its simple as that. I had no luck on the regular slots...but the drink service is fast and thats all that matters. the pool is AWESOME!!! 24 hours! and it was my anniversary so swimming with the hubby at 1am rocked. DO NOT get in the pool with the waterfall...i stuck my foot in and about got hypothermia. which reminds me about the tattoo place next to the pool...AVOID at all costs....i was curious what their rates were so i went in and asked how much to touch up my tat on my back cuz its fading....and they quoted me $150-$200....i only payed $100 for the tat in the first place and have already gotten a quote for a $20 touch up so there ya go. On wednesday night we decided to check out \""DJ Dynamixx\"" or whatever his name is at Dixies Dam Bar....WOW i was lonely in there. there was about 6 people in there max. the DJ was pretty cool tho he was playing shit from like the early 90s...when i was about 5 and my husband 12 so we we had a good time laughing about that...i was feeling pretty nostalgic. \n\nBottom line is the hotel was just fine for my 3rd wedding anniversary because i'm not a picky spoiled brat. Sure I could have afforded to stay at the Bellagio or somewhere but I'm too down to earth for that crap and so Hooters was a great and fun experience. theres a real mix of people...and its very entertaining. I wouldn't recommend this place to everybody but give it a try."
3,"Tried this place yesterday for lunch and really enjoyed it.  I had the Green Chili Pork with the corn tortillas (just like corn better).  The pork had great flavor and spice.  I did request a small cup of their extra spicy salsa, which actually had a hint of sweetness to it but good.  I liked the beans and rice as well.  The horchata was very tasty and a good balance to my lunch.  \n\nFor those not into meat I was there with a veggie eater and he enjoyed the no lard black beans with the veggie tacos (again corn tortillas here to avoid animal products).  \n\nI will be back to try another dish here for sure.  Also, it is nice that they have free parking in the back instead of filling the meter."
2,"Gave them another shot. We arrived and were promptly seated. Tonight my wife and I ordered two 12 oz. ribeyes to be done medium. Mine came out perfect, hers was well done.  They did correct the problem promptly. The house salads were fresh and the dressings were good. The chili was tasty, also. The draft beer (Sam Adams) was very cold and tasted good."
4,"My kids are a HUGE fan of this carwash, they actually ask me to go so they can play in the cool kids area and with the foam canon they can aim at cars going through the wash. Not to mention my van comes out sparkling clean :)"
2,First time trying this place out today. I guess it was ok. I was expecting better due to other Yelper's review. We had squid salad which was really good. The Murphy roll that other was suggesting was not that good. It was kinda sweet for our taste. It like mini dessert sushi roll. Just saying. \nWe also had Las Vegas roll that was pretty good. I'm always a big fan of Las Vegas roll it don't matter what sushi place. We also got the Calamari which I think it was kinda over cooked? Texture was kinda rubbery my wife said. The portion was pretty small too compared to Ra sushi that's my opinion.\nAs far as the pricing it was ok. Happy hour pricing is not a big deal. You save .25-$1 maybe depending what items you're going to get. \nYou can save 10% though if you go to their website for the coupon.
1,"As much as I'm all about new local places sprouting up, I have to say this place is just average and would only really consider it as a beer spot.  I've been back a few times since they've opened over the course of several months, and have been disappointed in the food and mediocre service.  Also the fact that they failed their health inspection back in June really doesn't help persuade me to come back anytime soon."
4,"I've already come to Biscuits about 20 times since they've opened, and I can say that they excel in everything I would hope for in a breakfast place: the food is great, the service strong, the atmosphere clean and inviting, and the wait not overwhelming.\n\nAll of the french toast options are amazing (especially the Almond crusted kind) and the omelettes are solid (although the chorizo is on the mild side if you're opting for that.)\n\nI love this place and hope it has a long and successful future."
4,This Japanese restaurant is run by a Japanese family. The service is exceptional. I love the thin slices of lemon in the water. The sushi is incredibly fresh. I ordered the Chirashi bowl for $25 and it was incredibly filling. It was full of delicious slices of fish. You pay for what you get here and it is all incredibly tasty and high quality. The restaurant is cute and usually packed. Reservations are highly encouraged. They have a cute table in the back for larger parties as well.
2,"They are complete cocks at this location and it's a pretty ghetto operation for such a large business. Given the choices of high speed internet, home phone and television - this is probably the best one if you want all of it from one company. The alternatives aren't better. If you want to get services from different companies though, you may do better than getting them all from Cox, but there's drawbacks from that as well.\n\nCustomer service is bullshit and their prices are too high, but whatever. Good luck getting technical support. They are clueless. Even so, it's better than the alternatives. Sad but true."
1,Bland coffee for the same price of Starbucks. Ain't goin back. Drive thru took a while too
2,"Japanese style crepes? Say what?? I had the pleasure to experience this Japanese delight and let's just say that maybe my selection wasn't all that great but everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs. \n\nWe went towards closing so there was hardly anyone there. Overall the place is clean but nothing that wows you when you walk in. I will admit that the bathrooms have pepto colored walls that it can stir up a bowel movement...just sayin'.\n\nAnyways  moving on to the crepe, they're made to order so they're as fresh as it can come. Picture Cold Stone but with hand held crepes (waffle cone style). The scent of crepes lingers in the air and takes you to that delighful moment of bliss. They have a pre-made menu to select from or you can make your own. Truthfully, it's cheaper to choose their menu than to make your own.\n\nWell I choose the one with caramel, brownie bites and marshmellows. Sugar shock indeed! The crepe was light and fluffy that it had a soft fortune cookie taste (as Paolo stated in prevvious review). Luckily they give you whatever ice cream flavor you want and whip cream so I played it safe by picking vanilla. Surprisingly I wasn't a big fan of it. I felt that they should have combined the items together instead of keep them separate. I didn't like having a bite of just marshmellows then the next bite was just brownie. It didn't please the palate very well. I knew I should of stayed with the Strawberry Sensation crepe! \n\nIn the end, this is a great place to get dessert crepes but in my opinion I would stick with the ones that offer some type of fruit as it balances out better than one with brownie or marshmellows. I only wish they offered non-dessert like crepes then I might give it 5-stars!"
1,I've been there a few time now for dinner.  its pretty much the only game in town when it comes to Caribbean food. I personally believe this place is a bit too expensive. For the life of me i cant imagine how Arroz con pollo is a $15 plate. On my last visit this past Saturday i must  say the service was in no way anywhere close to the levels they should be based on the price per plates.  The sangria had more ice than anything else and was very expensive. If my memory serves correctly it came out to $56 for two pitcher of ice.  Needless to say I'm very disappointed.  The food was ok but i actually felt gouged.   Sorry guys its been on our minds since the weekend and i felt we had to speak up.  I would also like to address the back room. I found it to have no atmosphere.  Very quite.  Lets try to remember this is a Cuban place and Cuban music and atmosphere should be present in all rooms especially on a Saturday night.. No?
2,"(located in the Hilton)\n\nEh, I am not the biggest fan of Chinese food, having grown up eating all that delicious food my entire life. \n\nThis was our 10pm dinner, and we were too hungry and tired after a long day at CES to venture off to better things, so we settled here.\n\nHighlights: sauteed eggplants and the pepper spared ribs."
4,Great restaurant. I like it very much. You have to taste it if you didn't taste it yet!
1,"If you're looking for a Mastros in the heart of Arcadia, Steak 44 isn't it. Although it's owned by Mastros, it's not the same experience as the original Mastros. The food was just ok and the choices were limited. Disappointed the pretzel bread - a Mastros classic - was not served. Lack of entertainment in the bar was another disappointment. Our waitress, Marina, was very attentive and helpful. Unfortunately, mid-way into our meal she announced she was being sent home as it was slow. The waitress who took over wasn't very personable, didn't offer a dessert menu (we had to ask) and we had to flag her down to get her to take our credit card. My husband and I left underwhelmed. Definitely worth the drive to the original Mastros or Dominick's Steakhouse (another Mastros owned restaurant)."
4,Been coming here for 10 years. Always tasty and the lady behind the glass is nice as hell! :)
2,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  It serves quite capable food, both American-Chinese style and some reasonably authentic food as well.\n\nIt's fancy, and their most authentic foods are written on the walls in Chinese, but I went with a Chinese friend and had a good meal, about as good as an average place in Chicago's Chinatown.  Three stars is supposed to be \""A-OK\"" and I think that fits this place.  I might not go out of my way to eat here again, but I'd have no problem going back again if I was in Urbana.\n\nService wasn't the best, but it wasn't horrifyingly bad either."
3,"Love this place. Think of it as DIY stir fry. Tons of veggies, spices and sauces to choir from to go along with your protein and starch of choice. They also have suggestions for combinations if you don't want to venture out and create your own. It's a laid back atmosphere. Nothing fancy. Just delicious food."
4,"Made reservations via OpenTable for 7:30PM but arrived early and was seated immediately. The setup of the restaurant is classic bistro but not crowded. We chose several dishes from the menu to enjoy and each one was prepared exceedingly well, though french fries were over salted. The service was well paced and classic. The wait staff extremely well trained and mannered. Everything about Bouchon screams excellence."
1,"As far as Panda Express' go, this one ranks near the bottom. As a plus, they're open 24 hours a day, so this is an ideal spot for a 3 a.m. meal when you're in a drunken stupor. The downside is that, unless you get REALLY lucky and walk up right as they're putting down some fresh food, chances are you'll wind up eating something that looks (and tastes) like it was made hours ago. Panda can be tasty quick Chinese food when it's fresh & hot, but after it's been sitting for a couple of hours it starts to practically decompose, leaving you with a plate full of nasty crap. I couldn't tell you a good time to stop in to this one, but at least it's located in a food court with a few other places that'll do if this isn't looking up to snuff."
4,"This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!! It is usually pretty busy, especially on Fri and Sat nights but it is worth any wait time, without question.  The stuffed dates are excellent and the mac & cheese is heaven.  If you come to Las Vegas I HIGHLY Recommend you put The Firefly on your list of must visits!"
3,"All you can eat & All you can drankkkkkk~\nBought a Groupon here for dinner for 2 for $45 and I think it was well worth it! \nWhen we came at 8:30 on a Monday night there was a little line but it moved fast.. we probably only waited like 15 minutes. After we were shown to our table we immediately headed for the seafood section! I filled my plate with crab legs, shrimp cocktail, crab stuffed fish and some slices of cheese. Those are the only things I ate at the buffet LOL no joke I literally had a repeat of the same plate 3x! HAHA They have both cold & hot crab legs everyday of the week! They are snow crab legs but they are already sliced down the middle to make it easier to eat. If the crab leg selection doesn't look that great just kindly ask the worker behind the counter to refill it! The shrimp were not that big but were already peeled and ready to go.   The fish was moist and stuffed with a tasty buttery crab stuffing! They had some interesting things that other buffets don't have like a whole section for middle eastern cuisine~ \nOur server was really nice and after giving her a little tip and after she realized I drink a lot of wine, she just left the whole bottle with us LOL \n\nWe left stuffed, happy & pretty buzzed! The regular price for the buffet is around $30/person.. I only think that is worth paying if you eat a lot crab legs and drink a lot of wine! \n\nHOT TIP: before you leave ask for an alcoholic drank to take with you~!!! more bang for your buck!"
3,Consistently good.  Friendly service and clean restrooms are always a plus in my book.
0,"Your web site stated 1/2 priced appetizers and $3.50 martinis and still you refused, stating there was a different Happy Hour Menu. Your sign out front said 40% off between 4pm and 6pm. Still no consideration. All this after we ordered and ate your mediocre appetizers and your waiter told us there was no problem. You even double-checked your web site and still did not reconsider. Business must be pretty good for you to turn away loyal neighborhood customers. And the food wasn't even that good. Sorry Marcello's ... that was your last chance."
3,"Local vegan mexican food that's gluten free...what more could a girl ask for?! ...With only a few vegan restaurants around, going out is limited, which is okay, but sometimes its nice to go out...I'm stoked I finally got to try the food here, well worth the wait. I think Tedibertos has the ability to succeed, especially since the location is great. I also completely understand and empathize with the opening of a new restaurant...of course there are going to be some bumps in the road. Nothing is ever perfect, have some compassion and patience people.  We ordered the tacos, quesadilla and nachos, which I personally think kicked some major ass.  We really need to help this place stay open, so definitely stop by when you can! My only recommendations would be try to find more lighting during dinner and start making your own organic wine!!! Good luck to ya'll and ill be back for sure!"
4,"I have used All Hours Plumbing twice in the last six months for a broken water pipe in my front yard. Brett came out and checked the pipe with 2 hrs of my call. The cost for both repairs were reasonable and I was given the appropriate information up front. You can pay by credit card and they email your receipt, which is a plus. I would use them again, but I'm hoping I won't have to."
2,"This gym has all the basic equipment that you would need to work out everything. I like this gym for the convince of how close it's to me. It has a kids area so parents are able to leave their children while they work out. They also offer a pool, basketball court, and racket ball area."
1,"My hubby and I are fairly new to the Scottsdale area and on the hunt for a good Mexican food restaurant.  We stopped in here because it had a nice patio area, but the menu prices were high.  We ordered chips & salsa and guacamole to start.  After reading the mediocre reviews on Yelp, we decided that this place was way over priced for what the offer.  Our chips & salsa and guacamole cost us over $11.00, (not including the tip). The guacamole came in a very small bowl and wasn't all that great...definitely not worth the more than $5 we paid for it.  We have opted to spend our hard earned money elsewhere.  BTW - where I come from, good Mexican restaurants don't charge for chips & salsa..."
1,"Who knew you could get kicked out of this MCD by an non-employee! Better watch your step here or the guy who sits by the counter will get you! Hehe. Just better buy something! Can't even use my wifi here in peace! I like the Mcd on Val Vista and Guadalupe better at least the manager there is courteous and polite to everyone.\nno privacy here either. Really, the management needs to let the employees do the table cleaning!They get off easy and hardly do anything! wow, what a shame!\n\nWell, thats all I have to say! Oh wait one more thing, I won't be coming back here again so thet dude can irritate the snot out of me! Oh my goodness, how annoying!\n\nI hope the management and owners read this!"
0,Supposed to be Medicare Approved Provider?  Tried for over a week to get wheelchair for my wife because of bad knee.  Two prescriptions provided from ER and Ortho Surgeon with no luck.  Multiple calls and correspondence between doctors office and Preferred Homecare with no luck.  Obviously not enough profit for them to handle request. Medicare did provide a list of alternate suppliers in the Las Vegas area who are more likely to comply.
3,"Any shoe lover needs to visit this store.  Every pair is worth a look (even if its just that) because each is really beautifully designed and crafted.\n\nThey carry a wide variety of styles in Debit Card, Platinum card, and Small Personal Loan price points.  :)  Men's line, too!\n\nI can really spend a whole day here, easily."
3,"So, for months I had been planning my weekend in Vegas.  Some friends were getting re-married at Cupid's Wedding Chapel.  I had disaster after disaster happen on my way to vegas, and once I got everything sorted, I needed some \""me time\"".  I researched Nail Salons on Yelp, and drove to All Star Nails.\n\nI was so happy I wanted to cry - when I walked in, the man who was working there asked me \""How can I take care of you?\"" - let me just say, the airline that screwed up, the rental car company that screwed up and the hotel that screwed up none of them asked me that.  This man knows the service industry - I already added money to his tip and I had just sat down.\n\nClean shop, lots of space, nice pedicure chairs.   All in all, a great, well priced mani-pedi.  I was sitting next to a stripper (the Olympic Garden is next door) and guess what - strippers know personal hygiene.  If you are even in need of a moment of pampering while you are in vegas - all star nails is an inexpensive option. My 1.5 hours prepared me for an amazing weekend.  (I'll be writing reviews...)"
1,We usually love this place and had told so many friends about it but today was not a good experience.  I had brought a friend to the store with me today because they do a buy one get one half price late for pastries on Saturdays. When we arrived at 3:45 they told us and several other people in the store including 2 pregnant women and several elderly women that the half price deal would not be until 4:00. At 4 we got back in line and waited to place our order.  When we made it to the front they decided to change the time to 4:15.  One of the elderly ladies said they had originally told her 3:45.  We were so fed up with the constant changing of time that we just left.  If your going to give a time then you should honor it!! Not keep changing your mind.  Very disappointed.
4,"Wow!\n\nI took my fiancee here to celebrate. We have lived in Madison for a long time but have only recently started getting adventurous with all the great food available. The interior of the restaurant has a very cool nautical theme. We arrived early, at the very start of service, so we had the dining room to ourselves for at least a little while. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable and kind. We tried a lot of new things and he was always willing to help out. \n\nWe started with some cocktails--I had a very sweet whiskey drink and she had some kind of warm red wine. Neither one was probably something we would regularly order but very good nonetheless. We also had some oysters, obviously. It was our first time and the waiter did a good job of helping us pick them out. Very fresh and flavorful. We have been converted. \n\nWe then moved onto our appetizer--steamed mussels in some kind of butter and wine sauce. Again, very good. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. My fiancee, who had never had them, was converted once again. \n\nFor our entree, we both had the shrimp, scallops and grits. Very artfully presented, with pork belly and some kind of yummy sauce. I had a local Pale Ale with the dinner. We ended with a key lime pie.\n\nAll in all it was an unforgettable meal. Service was great and food was great. Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Madison."
0,Horrible customer service just speak to you with attitude and don't let you know ahead of time that they're going to spend 30 minutes to put in the order to send a cab out.
3,"don't get me wrong, I'm still a HUGE fan of this place!! Whenever I'm on that side of town, I whimper at the thought of not being able to go here. Damn economy! *sigh* \n\nBut recently, I had my chance... to yet again dwell in the goodness that is Pizza a Metro. and GOOD GOOGLY MOOGLY!!! That's a HUGE pie!! A good friend and I went there when he said that he wanted a LOT of food. \""I want to order a small have a whole trough come to the table!\"" Not feeling the Heart Attack Grill, I convinced my friend to try PIzza a Metro. We did and it was wonderful! A little to loud for our liking - we really needed to shout to hear one another. But we loved it. \n\nWe shared the gnocchi with vodka sauce and I could just feel the world being lifted off my shoulders!! haha! He never had gnocchi before I feel I may have ruined him for it forever. Then we had the Pizza a Metro with three different types of toppings! THREE feet of pizza ya'll!! It was a shit load of food!! I couldn't believe it! Three feet of Sausage w/broccoli, arugula & procutto, and various meat toppings! It took up most of the table! We dug in and by the end of the night, most of that bad boy was gone! I couldn't believe we ate that much! \n\nOh and if that wasn't enough - our waiter told us of the various desserts! Desserts he said... we had to try the creme brulee - my FAVORITE dessert ever! and it was burnt! And undercooked at the same time! I couldn't believe it. I was so disappoitned! But I didn't let it ruin our great night. \n\nWe still talked until most of the lights were out. And we laughed over everything. It was a great night. I'm so glad we went. The food was as good as I remember it. To my yelpers I say GO!! but skip the creme brulee!"
1,"So I'm giving it a 2 star because the price is jus too much! \n\nFood - too damn expensive! Calamari $19 - It wasn't even that much, but it was good. Kobe Chili Fries - I think it was $19 or maybe $15 - Chili was good but its like they only gave 10 fries!!!! Baked potatoe $11. Chicken w?string beans - $31 - it was pretty good tho. 9 oz Filet Mignon - I heard it was good but its soooo damn small and they put it on a big @ss plate! REALLY!!!!\n\nDrinks - Cadillac Margarita - $25 - WTF!!!! its strong as hell but damn $25! I can buy a bottle of sumthin with that!\n\nif u got money to blow and u aint that hungry then this would be a good spot for u! Not a place for kids to eat, especially teenage boys!"
0,"This place has really gone downhill. The staff are very rude and getting worse. We had a group of people come over to get lunch during the week. The place was less than half full. The waitress, who apparently is the manager or supervisor, seats us and takes our drink order with a bad attitude right of the back. After she comes back we order our food. When the food comes back she's missing 1 of our orders and 1 of them is completely wrong. After explaining to her we didn't order that she argues with us and says yes we did. Not only did she argue with us about that, she argues we didn't order another entree for someone that clearly got a drink.  She leaves for a moment and comes back saying, she' s \""got all these other people to take care of, not just us\"". There were other staff taking other orders so we did not know what she was talking about.  We had to ask another employee for the rest of our food and sides that never came.  Getting drink refills was a burden on her.\n\nThe kicker was during check out we asked to split the bill. She explained that it would be easier on her if we would just split it at the cashier. The cashier who was wearing an arm brace was also extremely rude saying that it would be much easier on her if we would just pay for it and sort it out ourselves. (There was no one in line checking out)\n\nI've had issues with the son and mother behind the counter as well. They are not friendly and seem to have a double standard about paying for pickups over the phone.  They will tell you they cannot take credit cards on the phone but when you come in to pick up your food you see them taking credit cards over the phone.\n\nThe other issue with the call in orders is that the food must be sitting from over night because the consistency of the pitas and meat are stone cold when you pick up but warm and juicy when you dine in."
4,"After living in Vegas for the past 1.5 years of commercialized businesses, it really warms my heart to see a local family owned business when you are originally from a town full of them. The employees are are so friendly and welcoming and always willing to help. \n\nTheres a little Chihuahua there to greet guests and is a total sweetheart. The Dog House doggy botique also has little hand made treats for you to buy your pups!  \n\nI saw a little doggy treadmill from the outside which is what prompted me to go inside and the little chihuahua was more than happy to demonstrate how to use it! \n\nIt's really too bad I don't have a dog of my own or I would visit much more often (oops!)"
1,"I concur with MS. The inside is like a Denny's or Applebee's and doesn't fit with Vieux Port. The food was OK. They were open on June 24th, Jean Baptiste day, when a few other places were closed.\n\nI had the Osso Bucco, which was pretty good. The service was reasonable, the price was OK, but just like a Denny's or Steak-n-Shake you pay the cashier on the way out, which was slightly surreal."
0,"Worst service I've had in years. Our waitress disappeared for 30 minutes while our food got cold waiting for her to serve it. Then she had the nerve to add the 18% tip because we were a party of 7. Even though we were staying at the hotel and it is convenient, we will definitely not be going back."
0,"Worst experience we ever had at a restaurant.  Halfway through our meal, the manager turned up the volume on the TV so loud that everyone in the place jumped.  When asked to have it turned down, he said \""I'm busy, I'll get to it when I can.\""  There was one table in the restaurant and about 8 people at the bar (buddies).  It was blasting and we asked again and finally it was slightly turned down and he told the staff, that's as low as I'm going to turn it.  You could not hear the person next to you talk.  \nIn addition, the tenderloin on forccaia, was nothing more than a wrap, that is not forcaccia bread, onion rings were terrible, fish was not cooked through.  Rude, obnoxious manager, will never go back and will tell everyone we know how we were treated.  And when we left, there still were no other tables in the place."
0,"Rooms need to be updated but location is very nice. However, DO NOT answer the call for completing the survey of your stay for 20 percent off your bill. SCAM!! Our bank informed us of fraudulent charges of 2700.00."
4,The satisfaction guaranteed is an amazing chocolatey cocktail with a beautiful presentation and delicious taste.  The service is really nice. I liked the white corn croquettes and the waffle fries were amazing. When one of our salmon dishes was ever so slightly undercooked (not by my standards but by my friend's standard) they gave us a new dish and didn't charge us for the dish! I was so full I didn't have enough room for dessert. I gotta come back again!
3,"JALEO (at the Cosmopolitan)\nSeptember 2012\n\nJaleo is part of chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' Washington, D.C.-based empire, and the second of his restaurants with that name. His Las Vegas offerings also include \u00e9 by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (a paean to molecular gastronomy) and China Poblano (Chinese and Mexican).\n\n***The Menu***\nThere are pages of tapas, so take your time perusing the list. When I went, there were a couple of specials; check with your server. Paella is available, either as a single serving of the daily special, or as one of several available if ordered for six or more people. Lastly, a caveat: while a few of the tapas are small, many are nearly entr\u00e9e sized.\n\n***The Atmosphere***\nIt's a large, open space, brightly lit. There are many hard surfaces, making Jaleo a fairly noisy place; contributing to this is moderately to loud music. All in all, pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan. I ate at the bar. It seats around 15 people; the full menu is available. The bartenders, dressed all in black, are very friendly; my bartender was glad to discuss not only the drinks, but the menu.\n\n***The Food***\nI asked the bartender whether I should order a couple of items at a time, or everything at once. He suggested I might as well order everything at once; since there were several cooking stations, dishes would tend to appear slowly, over a period of time. That's what I did, and that's what happened. In no particular order, here's what I had:\n**Ensaladilla rusa con at\u00fan en conserva, with optional trout roe. Yeah, this is just glorified potato and tuna salad - but it's really good potato and tuna salad. The chunks of tuna were a lot firmer and moister than Starkist; dollops of flavored mayonnaise were a nice touch; the optional trout roe was tasty. This was one of those entr\u00e9e sized tapas.\n**La Serena con membrillo (La Serena cheese and quince paste cone). Think of this as a tiny ice cream cone (one large or two small bites), filled with a creamy cheese and quince paste. If you're familiar with mango paste, quince paste is very similar - perhaps slightly less sweet with a slight amount of bitterness. I'm not sure why, but I really enjoyed this one.\n**Fricand\u00f3 de carilleras de ternera y pur\u00e9 de patatas al aceite de oliva (veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato pur\u00e9e). Two large chunks of cheeks were soft and rich - just the way veal cheeks should be. Just as rich were the whipped potatoes. I liked this dish a lot, but you have to like meat that is soft and fatty.\n**Bacalao (salt cod; off menu special). My bartender recommended this dish. It was a special they started serving the night before. The dish consisted of a generous chunk of salt cod. Slightly chewy and salty, I liked both the texture and flavor. Accompanying it was some rich mayonnaise or aioli or some such thing. If this is still available, it's worth ordering.\n\n***Summary***\nThe Strip now has two high quality tapas bars: Jaleo and the nearby Julian Serrano. I've only had one meal at each, so it's difficult to say which is best, but I'd give the nod to Jaleo. I enjoyed my dishes slightly more, and the atmosphere is a little more upbeat. However, they're both winners.\n\n***The Bill***\nThe meal was about $60, plus drinks, tax and tip. This will vary a lot, depending on what, and how much, you order."
3,"I love going to this theatre! It is never busy. You don't have to go 30+ minutes before your movie to get an okay seat. You can go 5-10 minutes before, walk right up, buy your ticket, buy your food and drink, and find a good seat no problem. It is a pretty small theatre, but if they have the movie playing that I want to see I go here every time. \n\nThe only bad thing is they don't have all of the food options a lot of the larger theatres have. They obviously have the basics like popcorn and candy, but for more substantial food they only have hot dogs. My roommate was a little disappointed because she was looking forward to having a pretzel, but they didn't have them. \n\nIf you go not expecting a Harkins Cine Capri then you will love it. No lines, no waiting, great seats!"
4,"Love America's Taco Shop!  Carne Asada Burrito, that is all you need to know.  Nice people, fair prices, and good food.  If you are looking for an easy sit down dinner or lunch in the downtown area you should check out this place.  A+"
3,"Nice place. Met some new friends at the bar, and owner is very friendly. Meat and cheese plate is excellent. Beer list is hearty, although a bit mainstream for the craft beer aficionado. Happy hour is a great deal, and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood."
1,Underwhelming and far from fresh sushi. I had the chef inspiration with the green envy roll. The nigiri was nothing special. There are much better places to eat sushi.
1,"Oh Hubert Keller, I am so disappointed. The actual space - decor and ambiance - of Fleur is great. And the service is great. Beyond that, it was, ever so sadly, not good and a total waste of money and taste buds.\n\nThanks to Restaurant.com, I had a $25 gift certificate for here. So I figured that was my excuse to finally try Fleur, which had been on my list \""want to eats\"" for awhile. We sat at the bar, shared a cocktail and two of the small plates.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered ($15) was a Georgia Moon. Tasty, but too sweet and thick. And it was definitely on the small side. Not worth $15. 3 stars.\n\nFor the two small plates, we ordered the french onion soup shooter ($7) and lobster mac 'n' cheese ($18). The amount of truffle oil in the shooter glass was overwhelming. And the soup tasted very little like french onion. While a cool concept, the actual taste was a let down. 1 star. The mac 'n' cheese was bleh. The actual lobster pieces were chunky and great - better than most every other lobster I've had in a lobster mac 'n' cheese. However, the mac and the cheese were so bland and undesirable. Despite being hungry, I opted to leave half the dish uneaten. 1.5 stars.\n\nI so wanted to love this place. But alas, the food just didn't deliver. Many options sounded tasty. So maybe there are some good menu items here and we just chose poorly? But based on what we had, I'm not sure I'd be willing to risk the money to try anything else."
4,Found my new barber and they even do flat tops. Old school my friends.
4,I love the asiago ranch chicken sandwich with a spicy chicken. The bun was fresh and the chicken tasted like it had just been made. The salads are fresh and un-wilted. The employees are helpful and smile. I like this location a lot.
3,Had a quick take out lunch here. Food was good and ready in a matter of minutes.  I'll be back.
2,"Oh insert coins...I guess I expected too much from you.  I do love the concept of place, but the over priced games just flipped my frown way upside down.  My favorite game of all time, Asteroids, resides here but I was disappointed that it took 50 cents instead of the usual 25 I've always paid for it.  Anyways, it wasn't just that they jacked up the price on my favorite game but that the machines don't really work properly, essentially jacking your money because their buttons stick or the joystick doesn't maneuver right.  I'd had this problem on a few occasions and on different games. Usually, I just end up getting frustrated with the machines and head over to their dance area, where they place good to decent music on the nights I've been there. \n\nOther than the inconvenience of some of their machines, they also have newer games set up in booths with big flat screens.  This I find awesome and entertaining but I am not really much of a gamer so I just enjoy to watch.  Recently, I've seen Mortal Combat, Fifa, and Madden being played from the tvs  (that's for you gamers who are interested). Drinks are kind of on the pricey side. I could go across the street to the bar at El Cortez and get drinks for 3-4 dollars cheaper. Other than that, I've heard they have a nickle beer Tuesday! That I will be checking out soon.\n\nQuick tip: Pinball arcade is still my favorite place for old, well maintenance arcade games.  Cheaper, greater selection of games, but minus the alcohol."
0,"Hot n Juicy is my all time favorite restaurant, i always go to their original restaurant by spring mountain. But this one in henderson didn't do them justice! Their crawfish are so tiny compared to the other 2 restaurants by spring mountain and they have a really bad service here too! They forgot to serve our rice, so we waited for almost 30 mins to order a new one, and the taste of their sauces was just not very good comparable to the other 2 Hot n Juicy restaurants in Vegas..."
0,Extreemly small portions!! Expensive. Not that good. Dont come here if you are hungry bc you will have to eat 3 bread basketts to satisfy your hunger!!
4,"As I am Japanese, this is true Japanese Izakaya Restaulant with great quality for price. Many selection of Alcohols, open late, food quality,services...everything is great!! Highly recommend!!!"
4,"I got my dog Lucie as an adult from a breeder and have always had dog sitters come to my home because I was nervous to leave her in an unfamiliar setting. I heard about The Dog Den and decided to try it out while on vacation to Nashville. Ken and Jaqueline were simply amazing and all paperwork for Lucie's stay was completed electronically. The drop off process went smoothly and I knew she was in good hands. Later that day I was pleasantly surprised to get a picture of my sweet girl hanging out with some new friends. The owners provided periodic updates and were super flexible on the pick up time once I returned to town. They are extremely ethical, honest, and friendly. They go above and beyond what is expected of them.  \n\nSince this initial trip, Lucie has stayed at The Dog Den during two additional summer vacations and I always make sure to order her the aromatherapy treatment.  When I dropped her off the last time she got SO excited to go.  Now that the summer is over and I'll be back to work as a teacher, Ken and Jaqueline are emailing me dates that would be good for Lucie to come for daycare based on her interests because they want her to be happy when she is there.  The Dog Den is simply the best!!!"
4,"This place is clean and ran by great people and staff. The quality you get is good too. Everyone here is thought the Aveda way and follow it's guideline and standards. Just remember it is a school. Everyone here is still learning the trade so if you go expecting high salon care then you're looking in the wrong place. However, you can still find great service and care here."
4,"I love farmer's markets, but I especially love this farmer's market because it fosters so many great habits from me. First off, lately I've found myself biking there. Second, when I go there, I make it a goal to buy at least one vegetable to incorporate into my cooking. This week I am going to bake some zucchini. Mmm...\n\nSome of my favorite items here:\nPumpkins. I bought a pumpkin with some serious \""personality\"" for $5. It was tri-colored and oddly shaped. It makes for a great doorstep decoration.\n\nApple butter and pumpkin butter from the amish stand. Delicious and only made with natural ingredients.\n\nFresh herbs like basil, except they go bad if you don't use them immediately.\n\nCherry tomatoes, especially the heirloom variety that come in unusual colors. I had the privilege of trying a purple - yes, purple - variety that was savory. Mmm...\n\nAdditional favorites: \n- Live folk and clarinet music\n- Fresh kettle corn\n- The waffle truck! (I will write a separate review for this)."
0,"I will never come back to this Pei Wei. I hope the lackluster food was just at the particular location because I would dislike to ex out an entire franchise. I've only been to Pei Wei once and that was years ago. The order process is already kinda weird so when I was ready to order, the girl asked me if I was dining in or ordering to go.  I said to go and she says \""well this is the dine in line but it's ok\""...did she really need to tell me? There was no one else in the line so I wasn't holding anyone up AND she worked both lines so what the hell does it matter?  \n\nThe food from a scale to 1 to 10 was a 0.  I've never ate food with no taste.  The chicken was dry, the noodles had absolutely no seasoning.  There was only so much soy sauce I could put, I mean I had to salvage the one pack that they gave me. Cheapness.  If I wanted noodles with no taste, I could have boiled my own for free.  Lesson learned.  You guys will never get my business again!"
2,"I had the beef tacos and thought they were really good... We got there for the happy hour where they were doing 2/1 margaritas which were made really well and the staff was very nice..\n\nThe only drag is that Hard Rock is the hang out for the local turds, tourist Goomba's and the wanna be rockers... That was the only thing that took away from this place."
0,"I say pass on this AYCE sushi joint. Sushi was ok. But everything started to taste the same. I guess they like using the sweet sauce in all their \""special\"" rolls.  Once in a lifetime visit for me. Never again. \n\nTheir service was really sucky. Waitresses were very rude. Customer service is not their thing. \n\nPeople pass on this place. Kbye."
3,"I think this might be the spot. this place is so cute. Love the layout. :))) butttttt... let me start off by saying parking was ridiculous!!! Who has a parking spot that only has 8 spots... Omg. I parked right across the plaza from the gas station. We walked!!!! :(\n\nWe started off with the artichoke dip. It was fabulous. It was spot on creamy and hot. The bread with crunchy and it well with the dip. We also had the margherita pizza. Very declious :))\n\nThe waiter wasn't very helpful nor seem like he likes his job. I asked for new plates because the plates we have on the table was wet and muggy look. He took forever, so I went and got it myself. This was his response when he saw me get them \"" thanks for getting them, (shaking his head) \"" wow.  really?!? Oh there's more. So my girlfriend and I ordered the Creme Brule. He came over and had the torch to caramelized the top of the creme Brule. I said awesome, do you mind if I record this. He said \"" wow, what is this world come to when you have to instagram everything\"" seriously?! I just snarled at him.  Seriously,  the food was great, the dessert was delicious.  But this guy must be a joke... riight?!\n\nI'll be back, but not to that kind of service."
0,Food sux. Overpriced. Wont come here again!
2,"Second time at FEZ and it was a good experience, once for brunch and once for dinner. Employees are extremely friendly. I heard the burgers are delicious here especially the FEZ burger and mine was just the opposite. I had ordered it medium rare, protein style with the sweet potato fries. First, they brought it out on a bun and brought it right back. Once they brought it out the correct way, I tried a bite and it wasn't medium rare by any means - it was closer to well. The fries were also cold. They had a great taste with the accompanied sauce but would have been better warm."
4,This place is awesome! Definitely sit outside if it's nice out...hard to beat the rooftop!
0,"Our experience with Dr. Darzev, found her rude, arrogant and condescending.  Totally unprofessional.  Not only did she possess a nasty attitude, but it honestly didn't seem like she was familiar with practicing medicine.  When patients need to instruct the Dr. to check a child's spine during a routine annual check-up, something is not right.  We were rushed through the entire process and I have never been so upset by a doctor in my entire life.  \n\nTo compliment this poor service, the Dr's assistant's had no clue why we were even there, despite the fact we scheduled an annual physical exam.  It was like the entire office had just opened that day.  Absolutely unprofessional. Although her office is in a convenient Summerlin location, driving a little further down the road is well worth the health of your family.  I could go on and on, but my job is done.............you have been warned."
0,"Took about 15 min for them to smog a truck, then the next one got done in 5 min if that. Then it was my turn but the guy had one of his friends drive in before I could and it took him 25 min to smog his friends car. They were talking half the time, cursing and talking about very inappropriate things. Will never use again."
3,"Cheap crap!? YES!\n\nSooo Im a thrift store shopper, and am not afraid to tell you! Now I dont really buy clothing, but I love books, and knick knacks from here! This store isnt huge, and its a lot more quaint but the customer service here is wonderful! The cashiers are sooooo kind and sooo sooo patient! Plus on Tuesdays casino employees and players card members get 20% off! SCHWING! \n\nThey have many great finds, books, bags, and even sometimes kitchenware! They are not exorbitantly priced like other places! Like I said it small so its easy to navigate through!\n\nMy son always find little guns and crap and I found a gnarly Electric Brand backpack for 3$!!\n\nGo get your cheap on here!"
4,"Was referred by a buddy of mine.  I had originally taken my car to the Mazda stealership in Henderson where a free inspection turned to \""You have this and that wrong.\""  I was a little skeptical to their results as I had done research before through forums and saw one of the scam gimmies that they employ on the invoice.  Needless to say I didn't get anything done there.     \n\nWhen I arrived at Samurai, I met Yoshi, and explained to him the \""recommendations\"" they had given me at Mazda.  He proceeded to inspect the car and told me I only needed an engine mount replaced and not any of the belts I was told needed replacing at Mazda.  I saved money and didn't get taken.  This dude is legit.  He's a unicorn, honest mechanics do exist.  And now he has a new customer for as long as I live in Vegas.\n\nBig ups Samurai Motors!!!"
2,If you want to look at girls in kilts/miniskirts that look like they're still in high school prancing around it's great in addition to a large volume of TVs... food is decent prices are decent nothing much stands out at the tilted kilt
2,"Blasting heavy metal, industrial decor, and a menu showing love for coffee contrasted against the difficulty of having a conversation and the coffee itself, which failed to deliver on its promise. \n\nAnother reviewer referenced Portland - they take their coffee and customer experience much more seriously. Still, it's nice to see someone in Arizona making an effort."
2,"The food is a tad better than okay. The service is somewhat mixed, it depends who you get for the evening. Some are more motivated than others. The manager, Summer :-), is awesome. Ask her if you need anything or have tips for her to inspire you to come again. When I do a food business, I will want her on my team.\n\nWe love the free wifi. A must for any locale these days. The bear is GREAT. Love the micro brews. \n\nA note in general: somebody get a grip on the fish prices in Arizona please. The only healthy omega3 and protein source we all need, instead, yes yummy but unhealthy quesadillas are cheap. Something's wrong here. Most locations throughout the valley still don't take enough advantage of the promotional built in coupons Yelp has to offer to attract new and keep old customers.\n\nThe five different music styles running non stop in the desert ridge outside area mixed with every store's individual out put is nerve wrecking.\n\nA few big plants and bushes along the iron fence would create a more natural and soothing setting. Atmosphere is half the rent."
1,"I will never understand why this place is always packed? The steaks although lean are never cooked the way you ask them to be. The pulled pork sandwich comes dry (no sauce what so ever). I also think they use more salt then any other eatery I have gone to. You shouldn't have so much salt on the fries that you have to search for signs of potato. I understand people get a kick out of throwing the peanut shells on the floor and all, but it also makes this one of the dirtiest restaurants around. Yes the rolls are flavorful, but tend to be on the hard side. One of my two stars go to their sweet tea. If you pick this place to eat give it a try. \n\nOn a side note the wait staff tends to sing Happy Birthday at the top of their lungs every five minutes. Be ready to scream to the person at your table if you want to be heard."
2,"For a place to just go and boogie, Liquid Rooms is actually pretty good! I'll admit, I had my reservations when I accidentally suggested we go here - the last time I went was probably in my late- teens. \n\nHowever, on a Friday night, the place is filled with all ages - some with top banter-  and there's a shisha bar in the back ! At the time, I thought \u00a310 for an hour was a total bargain and it might have been something to do with the jager-bombs, but it tasted just like it does on holiday and was a really nice addition to an otherwise so-so night out. \n\nIt is a handy location for when you are debating where to go to finish a night out. The music was pretty standard. Can't beat a bit of impromptu karaoke to Bohemian Rhapsody with some randoms!"
0,"OK I have as good of a sense of humor as the next guy. Probably better. But this place just plain rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI understand the premise of the place, staff treating you like garbage and you're supposed to laugh it off as part of the charm, but for real, you gotta draw a fuckin line somewhere.\n\nMy story: A friend and I came here to grab a drink and we see a bunch of people wearin these weird paper hats with things like \""asshole\"" and other insulting shit like that written on them. I won't write what some of 'em say because they were just plain gross (especially for a place that serves food), again, understand where the line is. \n\nSo I start talking to one of the bartender chicks and she tells me the hats are insults that they label individually and, in one of the most twisted compliments (may have been a pass, I really don't fuckin know or care to know for that matter) I've ever had heaved at me in my life. She says to me \""like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get,\"" I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying \""right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?\"" then just turned around and walked away. \n\nI'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!? Also if I did, that would just not be in the most poorest of tastes to say. Even for a place like this.\n\nAnyways the moral of the story is, know when to draw a line if you're gonna run this type of joint because it's a pretty slippery fuckin slope and shit could get real bad throwing words like that around."
1,"This is Mexican food for white people. Not horrible, but rather bland and boring.\n\nCarne Asada = over cooked and way too under spiced\n\nGround Taco Meat = way too much chipotle and not enough cumin\n\nChimichanga = tasty, but super greasy \n\nFajita Chicken = not enough Adobo seasoning\n\nRefried Beans = pretty darned good for retried beans \n\nSalads = both are surprisingly flavorful\n\nStore bought flour and corn tortillas (lame)"
1,If you're looking for a good steak or prime rib don't try this place. I asked for a medium rare rib eye and it was not what I expected. The meat was not juicy at all. The side of mushrooms were very bland. I think the potatoes were once flakes.
3,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place before. This place is great!!! I was looking online for some fall things to do, pumpkin patches, etc, and Vertuccio Farms came up as being in the area I was going to be today. It is about 3 miles south of the 60 on Power Rd and about a half mile north of the 202/San Tan Freeway. \n\nOpen until 6pm on Sundays, they just opened yesterday (10/1) for fall. It is $7 per person and children 4 and under are free. You can get a $1 discount for each non-perishable good donated or print out a coupon from their website. Additionally, you can pay $15 for a season pass. \n\nYou are greeted by rows of pumpkins of various sizes as you walk in. The prices are comparable to Safeway but I would rather support local businesses. If I didn't think the heat would warp the pumpkins, I would have bought some today. There were several things to do here for adults and kids. There was a bounce house for kids and way larger one for kids and adults. Boy, that was fun! There was also one of those things that you swing the mallet down and try to hit the bell (separate ones for kids and adults). I laughed out the fake cow that the kids could \""milk.\"" There was a corn maze that we didn't go in since the girl warned me it takes 45 minutes to go through. Maybe next time on a cooler day. Other fun things we did were fake horse rides with inflatable horses, pedal go karts around a small track, and a free train ride around the grounds. Yes, the hubby and I squeezed ourselves in, too. In addition, there was a playground and many farm animals to see. \n\nThere was also a farmer's market that closed at 4pm that we would have loved to check out. My suggestion would be to keep the hours consistent with the farm or, the farm could showcase some of the local goods from the farmers' market. That is one of the things I love about coming to places like that, to get a taste for all that is local. Other than that small thing, this was the best $7 per person, we have ever spent on a family outing!"
4,"Love this place - the food, the ambiance, the SERVICE and the food again! Just perfect. Ask for Devynn if you go! She's fantastic. \n\nThis is an upscale place where you can either dress a little nicer for a great date night or a little more casual."
2,"Once upon a time, when I was at the ripe age of 8, I would look forward to my family vacations in Vegas - watching the cheesy shows, playing at the kiddy arcades, getting kicked out of the casino for being under aged, you know the usual. \n\n(It really did happen, by the way)\n\nBut I loved staying at the MGM Grand, being welcomed by that huge Wizard of Oz display, seeing the lions habitat...but all that is gone and it makes my childhood self very sad.\n\nMy adultself is also not too pleased with the hotel as of recent. While they may have gotten rid of some '90s memorabilia, the MGM's vibe is still very much stuck in the past. Aside from having a great pool area (there's like 18 pools here. not really, but there's a lot) and lots of dining to choose from, the hotel itself is a bit blah and outdated.\n\nThe rooms need major renovations. For what you pay, you'd expect a classier room with furniture that wasn't upholstered 20 years ago, it seems. The bathrooms are nicer than the actual bedroom I will say. My friends and I shelled out $509 (for a double) for two nights which I find pricey for the quality of the room.\n\nWill go back for the hotel's attractions, like Ka or the day club, but not to spend the night."
2,"After a week long stay in Los Angeles and eating exceptionally great Chinese food I came home with a craving for more. Due to sparkling reviews of Tott's and the fact that it is located across the street from my home I decided to give them a try. \n\nI phoned in an order for stir fry Mongolian beef with brown rice.  The order was ready upon my arrival so there was no wait time. The guys at the counter were friendly so no complaints about customer service. \n\nHowever, I was somewhat disappointed in my Mongolian Beef as it was extremely sweet. It was full of tender slices of beef and lots of veggies but entirely too sweet for my taste buds.\n\nI will definitely return and try other items suggested by fellow Yelper's but I will definitely stay away from the Mongolian unless I am craving dessert."
1,"Located in the Planet Hollywood Mall, which is extremely small and cluttered. This location no longer carries The Art of Shaving products."
1,"Not impressed. \n\nI went to go get my haircut in Town and Country over near the Biltmore and had some time before my barber showed up  and decided to get a bite to eat, so I wandered into Souper Salad to give it a try.\n\nI ordered the buffet and some Ice tea. It was really terrible, the salad selections were lame, and look not so fresh, the glass didn't look clean nor did the dishes or silver ware.\n\nMy table was dirty my server Nico did not reach his server goals, I did not have my drink in 90 seconds or less. \n\nThe Baja tacos looked old an not at all fresh...definitely did not feel like I was on the beach as the sign said on the wall after sampling one. \n \nEverything was bland except for the soup, and the pasta was OK and that is the only reason this place got more then one star. In general thought they needed to just rename this place to Soup...no salad!!!!"
0,"When will I learn...\n\nOccasionally I like to give places that have disappointed me a second chance.  Today I was running errands on lunch and popped in here to take a sandwich back to the office.  \n\nLet me preface by saying that it had been months - nearly a year - since I'd visited here.  This was due to consistenly mediocre food and the final straw being bright blue peices of rubber chopped up in my salad.  I can't beleive that the staff didn't notice but I did - after I'd already gotten back to my office and did not have enough time to go back.  I had no lunch that day...  \n\nSo today I thought - I'll pick up a sandwich to go.  It's been a while - I'm sure things are better.  The sandwich was an \""Uptown Turkey on Harvest Toast\"".  It has turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Well the avocado was so insignificant, I'd actually forgotten it was an ingredient.  The lettuce wilted - not from the toast but from sitting around.  The bread too toasted and burnt in the middle.  What a disappointment.  \n\nI really do not reccomend this place at all.  It's not even worth going back to have my messed up meals 'replaced'."
4,"Kicks ass! \n\nTalk about great atmosphere! This place rocks! The food was outstanding. \nWe were looking for hot dinner spots for the weekend we found this place The Cathouse at the Luxor.\n\n We made reservations early in the day for that night. We showed up like 2 minutes before our reservations and they sat us immediately. \n\nThe walk up the stairs is great. Very cool old pictures and decor. Our waitress was truly gorgeous! The place is so cool! The decor is dark leather and cool chandeliers, seats and outfits. \n\nThey have a 3 course dinner thing that is perfect. Soup or salad, main course, and then dessert for less than $40.\n\nI ordered the Onion soup and Petite Fillet mignon. The soup was incredibly hot and delicious and the steak was Perfect! You couldn't have cooked it any better and the flavor was amazing, you could have cut it with a butter knife. Dessert was good. \n\nOverall the experience was great to excellent! Be sure to check it out on your next visit.\n\nDino...)'("
4,"Food is really good, plus it's a nice change for Anthem.   Don't forget to try them for breakfast.  Not expensive per se....."
1,"Honestly, in Charlotte when someone tells you a restaurant is great, you need to take it with a grain of salt. Bistro la Bon is a perfect example. The food is decent, but not outstanding considering the price. I have tried dinner and brunch here. I would not recommend it for the later. The brunch menu is uninspired and the service was terrible. It took my friend and I twenty minutes to receive a menu and attention from the waiter. There were about five other groups in the restaurant \n\nDinner was a better experience. The atmosphere is good for a date night, but nothing about the menu stood out. \n\nI do not anticipate returning."
2,"I didn't love this place but then again, I didn't hate it. The husband and I were just walking around in NYNY trying to stay dry from the rain that weekend. We were hungry but not starving so we wanted to grab something quick to eat. We walked by the America Restaurant and the cronut's at the entrance basically welcomed us in. We were quickly offered a table to sit at. The place itself is interesting looking. There is a HUGE United States 3D map. Looks pretty cool and it is def something to stare at for a while. The restaurant is pretty big but to my surprise was pretty empty too. We decided to just order appetizers and our waiter took our order. We ordered the potato skins because it caught our attention being that it had chorrizo. Took quite some time before our order came out, too long for a place that was empty and for an appetizer. The potato skins were interesting and unfortunately a bit on the luke warm side rather than hot. It tasted like it had refried beans, chorizo and sour cream. The chorizo was pretty good and it made the plate worth it. The price was fair and service was alright. As far as going back, probably not. We decided to not get a cronut on the way out since the food was just ok, we didn't want to risk a disappointment. The restaurant is sort of like a diner so if you are looking for diner food, they have it here. I did see a couple next to us share a sandwich and fries and boy was that a large order."
4,I absolutely LOVE Bahama Bucks! I have a friend who works at this one; Noah Packer. He was in my writing class.. He got me into this! I still have two free Bahama bucks tickets that I'm using today.. I recommending this to everyone I know! Definitely 5 stars !
3,It's jard to judge Fez on the hour I spent there but the service was friendly and prompt. The Krisas we enjoyed was tasty enough and the garlic and rosemary fries were delicious.\nI will be back for a full dinner.
0,"Sweet Tomatoes reminds me of those store purchased cookies from my childhood called Almost Home Cookies. They were almost good but weren't. Sweet Tomatoes is Almost good but also isn't. I tried a variety of things and couldn't find one thing that was good to me except for the service.\n\nI made myself a nice big salad with mostly nice produce but whatever dressings were in the salad mix tasted awful to me so my whole nice almost good salad didn't taste good.\n\nI tried the Thai Cole Slaw and after a bite I was done with that. It was almost good made with nice fresh vegetables but lacked the taste I wanted. \n\nI tried some sort of pasta salad with turkey and the seasoning just wasn't tasty. It was almost good but wasn't. The pasta was very squishy and turned to mush and the turkey had a strong turkey taste to it so it needed a good flavor to cover that up.\n\nI tried a piece of grilled chicken, it was moist but was over seasoned with some sort of Italian concoction that tasted awful. Too much dry maybe old herbs. Seemed like it could have been good chicken but wasn't.\n\nTried a little square of pizza. Wow that was bad and not close to almost good. It's kind of like Wonder Bread with tasteless sauce and almost no cheese.\n\nTried a spoonful of Macaroni and cheese, it was maybe slightly better than the blue box stuff and seemed similar to that with maybe some added real cheese. \n\nI thought the sweet potato plain might be good. It was a real potato but it was water logged and seemed like it was steamed with lots of water entering the potato making it a watery potato like baby food.\n\nThe soft serve was almost good. It tasted watered down but was thick. The metal bowls were nice that kept the ice cream cold.\n\nMaybe the worst thing I tried was the sweet orange cranberry muffin. It wasn't sweet and had raisins in it instead of cranberries. It just was very unappetizing and was very bread like.\n\nAlmost good........ but wasn't. \nSorry to put it that way but that's the way the cookie crumbles.\n\n1.5 stars"
4,I really loved the griffin! Great locals pub with a nice selection of beer on tap and the waitress made me a delicious bloody mary :)
3,"One of my favorite cheap eat places in Chinatown! I usually go for the grilled pork BBQ Vietnamese sandwich. I love that their bread is the perfect amounts of doughy and crispy and they fill it very generously with meat, veggies and mayo. Their meat is never too chewy or fatty and one sandwich usually does the job to fill me up. When you order egg rolls or spring rolls, they make sure everyone at the table has dipping sauces. I'm not a fan of pho, I do like their soup-base and the people that I have ordered with did enjoy their pho. I enjoy drinking their hot tea, especially since they don't charge extra. \n\nThe owners and workers here are always very attentive and the restaurant has plentiful seating and is never too full. The only con I could think of is that they usually have Fox News playing in the background, which makes for unsavory commentary or images while you are dining."
0,Had lunch delivered to the office today.  It was a half-hour late.  The meatball sub was decent but squished. The $5 cookie was blackened and burnt.  I'm embarrassed for them.
1,"These cupcakes were ok, but they taste just like they are from the grocery store. I dont know what's up with the frosting, it just has a strange taste. When I got there, there were hardly any cupcakes left, so my selection was limited, if they wouldn't have been buy one get one free, I would have never paid the prices they want for those cupcakes. It's ok, i would eat them again, but I don't think I will ever be going back. Sprinkles wins, hands down, anyone who says otherwise is nuts!"
4,"My first review on yelp, and I'm happy to review this gem. I've tried the moussaka, good flavor , enough spice, bechamel sauce great. Filet skewers cooked perfectly, moist and juicy. Yeah, it's all Greek to me, and I love it. Service is good, happy I found it."
3,"We arrived the Palm Beach one minute before they close and they welcomed us and even tough we were the only group left in the restaurant they gave us their full attention. \n\nThe food is amazing, they have a huge menu of all \""traditional\"" western Saudi foods. Their dishes taste like the food in an average Saudi family house."
3,"This place is awesome. The service was quick and they were very attentative. As for the food...YUM!!! Spring rolls were delish n fresh and the Pho was flavorful. It was also very busy with people walking in every 3 mins.  Definitely recommend this place anyday!  oh yeah, the portions are huge and they don't give you the option to order a smaller bowl and you have to be 12 and under to order a kids size bowl. Other than that  great food."
3,"So close!!!  ... 1 star taken away b/c the hotel is far from the strip.  I wish it was at least near the M Resort Spa & Casino.  We didn't arrive until 3am due to traffic on the way to Vegas.  :[  \n\nCheck-in = quick & easy since we were basically the only ones awake at that time\n\nThe Room = its my dream loft style home!  It's modern, clean, fresh, & has everything I could ever need in a home.  Full kitchen w/ breakfast bar - fully equipped with pots, pans, plates, cups, & cooking tools.  There is a desk area w/ a chair & a flat screen TV on a swivel stand so you're able to watch it in the kitchen, in bed, or while you're sitting on the L-shaped couch.  King-size bed was large & comfortable.  There's enough room in the closet to hold a good amount of clothes if you plan on staying for a while.  \n\nThe Bathroom/Shower = I liked how there was a lot of space in the bathroom even though there was only one sink.  Every time I was in it, I felt clean.  The shower was also nice - I liked how they had a shampoo/conditioner & body wash dispensers inside the shower.  They smelled nice and made my hair feel soft.  \n\nThis place is EVEN BETTER because they allow small pets to stay with their owners conveniently inside their room.  Yes, they have a pet deposit, but its worth it if your small friend can stay at a luxurious place alongside you.  :]  :]  :]\n\nSide Notes:  There is complimentary breakfast every morning (not your average breakfast - I feel like this place provides you with more choices and fresh food).  I love the main lobby area of the hotel, though it was usually occupied by families, they have plush couches and tables w/ chairs to sit at and hang out during your stay.  They have a small gym, but nicely equipped and the pool area has a place for guests to BBQ if they so choose.  Oh, there's also a tiny grocery store located in the lobby.  The only thing I didn't like was how much parking they had in the front of the hotel.  The sides are darker & a little scary to park far from the front entrance at night.  \n\nI wasn't ready to leave :["
4,"Pricey, but worth going just to see the dolphins. Almost not worth the cost because the other animals always have an agenda - hiding. You can see a nose of this or a tail of that which is kinda disgruntling, but you just saw dolphins above and below the water. So... mellowed out, you meander back towards the strip. Almost makes you not want to strangle those guys handing out the little adult cards. Almost."
2,Fast food is fast food- This place was A-OK for me and the BF for the start of our road trip. The line in the drive thru was pretty fast and the staff was friendly.\n\nI always order the same thing- Santa Fe Chicken and the BF gets the $6 burger. Everything tasted fresh and the fries and zucchini were piping hit.\n\nI would definitely return to this location if I am ever going on another road trip.
0,The worst car wash spot in all AZ.   Just brought my brand new x6 to get washed.  They managed to scratch the hood with a hand wash.  Some convict approaches me saying they didn't do it and that this happens with hand washes. (Btw all they employ are ex convicts since they lost their hard working illegals). So I payed extra for a hand wash for these pricks to scratch my hood????   BEWARE DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!
1,"Overrated. Boring sandwiches, meh...salads. Cookies are soft but made with way to much shortening. Overall very unsatisfactory."
3,"We ate there last night. We had the \""gluten friendly\"" free Bianca Pizza, it was very good. We loved the atmosphere, the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be returning. Welcome to the neighborhood."
3,"I will admit that I am fairly new to sushi so my frame of reference for \""good sushi\"" is somewhat limited; however, I do understand freshness and quality and Sushi Creek nails it, consistently.\n\nMy absolute favorite is the tuna nigiri. Melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious, a must-try with the snapper a close second.  If your a fan of rolls then the Spicy Scallop Roll is a good one to try here.  There are plenty of choices for those who don't eat sushi too.  Decent burgers, flavorful teriyaki as well as a selection from the daily specials board.\n\nService on weekend days can be a tad slow at times, but the atmosphere is casual and comfortable and you never feel rushed."
2,"I enjoy eating here as it's always on the short list of a friend of mine.  While I have found lower prices elsewhere, I certainly wouldn't call this place expensive.  \n\nI very much enjoy the fresh salsa and chips, and love their chimis.  You can't go wrong with this place.  And they always bring us a little desert at the end of the meal.  I don't know exactly what it's called, but it's fried tortilla with honey and whipped cream.  Perfect way to round out the meal!"
2,"The rooms are spacious, clean and new. The reason for 3 stars is personal for me. When I go to Vegas, I like to be in the middle of the action. While the location of this hotel is central, there is absolutely 0 fun in the hotel itself. There is no casino, no restaurants, really nothing at all. So if you are looking for only a room - stay here. But if you're looking for a true Vegas experience - try the other City Center hotels - Cosmopolitan and Aria - you'll be eating and playing there anyway."
2,"Good food and you can't beat the lunch specials! I've come here for the Thursday curry and the Monday pad thai and both were great at only $5! Watch out, this place can get crowded at lunch but don't worry, the line moves quick.\n\nCan't wait to try the pho!\n\n10/27/14 UPDATE\nI just got back from eating here for lunch. They've instilled a new policy where if you order the special, its automatically served in takeout containers. For someone who goes out of their way to limit their contribution to landfills, I'm not sure if I'll be coming here often to say the least and I definitely will avoid ordering the daily special."
4,"After looking around some, I bought my new bike here because the salesperson really took the time to show me the bikes that met the criteria I gave him, and to explain the benefits and drawbacks of various components, brands, etc.  This place has a nice selection of commuter bikes, which was what I was looking for.  Whenever I told the guy my concerns about this or that, he'd take that into account before showing me the next bike.  Then they let me browse on my own as long as I wanted without trying to push anything.  They also let me take all the time I needed on test rides.\n\nOnce I picked out my bike, the salesperson helped me pick out the stuff to go on in (rack, fenders, etc.), which the service department installed for free.  They gave me a nice discount on the purchase, and sales plan that includes a one-year tune-up.  When one of the bike baskets proved to be too tight for me to open, one of the mechanics came out and loosened it up.\n\nAll of which is to say, I can't imagine how a shop could do a better job of helping me pick out a bike, and making sure I rode away on something I'll be happy with.  Yay, Willy!"
1,"I love KFC food, but not the service at this location. The manager told my boyfriend & I in a very bossy way (right as we were handing him our money) that 'our order is to-go' at 9:30 because they were closed. The sign on the door said they closed at 10. I was soooo mad!"
1,"Well, the menu is big lots of selections, but the hey...I would refrain from ever getting any of the salads as they are made with ice berg lettuce which is not the best lettuce to eat and has basically no nutrition value but hey it is the cheapest you can buy. Also for the appetizers they are not worth the price ..we got the veggies it was a small plate of veggies with some ranch dressing in a container, they forgot to give us the pita squares and very small plate of veggies and they sell it for $9...do not order...also all the appetizers we had were over prized and not enough for two people except the mussels if you order the mussels you get about 16 of them which is a good...for the rest of the meal hey...they are overpriced on everything, they buy inexpensive food and sell it at a high price to make a profit...wish they had better quality food.  avoid the salads...the burgers were just okay nothing to write home about.  the desserts were just okay nothing to write home about....just okay everything was just okay....nothing amazing"
4,"Went for lunch.  It's still within two months of opening and it's doing well from the size of the crowd.  Parking is a bit of a challenge and you may have to park across the street (or in Amigo's Appliances lot as I did...not suggested).  \n\nThe atmosphere is a nice change from most Pho places.  It has a modern, slightly contemporary feel to it with all the amenities of a social meeting locale (good bar, few small TV's in the corners above the bar).  Walls are exposed brick and it has the now required community table.\n\nHad the Pho and it was outstanding.  Tough to find good Pho generally in Phoenix but their's is impressive.  Fun, upbeat staff.\n\nOnly hit was that it did take a little time to get the food but nothing too lengthy.\n\nTry it out!"
3,"I am a fan of University Animal Hospital. I have taken my dog there a few times and have felt like she was getting top notch care. I don't know if their prices are reasonable or not, but I have been more than satisfied with their level of care. \n\nMy dog was sneaky and nosey enough to get into a bottle of medication in the house. I called UAH, they fit me in immediately and were up front, and clear about my options and cost. They helped me make an informed decision about the care I could afford. They spent a lot of time talking through our options and explaining the different treatments available. I never felt rushed. They even found a few ways to cut down on the cost of the treatment. I was very happy with the service. My puppy is healthy as ever, and that is in no small part due to the car at UAH.\n\nThe only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because on a number of visits one of the ladies working the front desk was downright not friendly. Don't get me wrong, out of the 6 people working up front, she was the only one that didn't seem to care about her customer interactions. Everyone else was great, but she left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Yet I wouldn't hesitate to return. I would trust my dog with them everyday of the week."
2,It's the best Mediterranean food I have had in Madison do far but that really isn't saying all that much.  The food was good but nothing special.  Service was overbearing and annoying.  How many times do you need to ask me how the food is?  4 times was a bit much.
0,"I've been to other Hungry Howies without problem but this one is by far the worst restaurant customer service I have ever encountered. We ordered online and after 1 hour and 30 minutes I call them and they said they came twice, knocked on the door and called my phone with no answer. I was home the entire time and my phone didn't ring once, and there was no voicemails for that matter. I was transferred to a manager who wouldn't let me explain to him that I indeed was home the entire time and didn't hear a single knock and he kept interrupting me, so quick to defend his staff. No apology. He then said the pizza was still sitting there in their restaurant and they would send it on the next truck out. At this point my food would be cold and who knows when the next delivery would go out. So I called back to cancel and explained that I would rather not pay money for cold pizza and terrible customer service and they said Ok AND HUNG UP. No apology. Didn't try to accommodate me at all. At least I was planning on paying in cash so no refund to dispute. \n\nThey obviously don't care about the happiness of their customers and I refuse to give them my business ever again."
0,"Wow has this place gone down hill and it seems the owner has no time to care to take a customers call in regards to service or order.\n\nWe normally order here at least once a month sometimes more.  The past few times little things were wrong here and there, we decided to overlook them until tonight. \n\n4 orders we placed tonight were to come with pita.  Guess what only the gyro sandwich did.  Not the chicken plate, not the large greek salad, and not the feta and olives.  We also ordered an Italian Beef Sandwich no peppers.   Guess what open foil to find a large piece of green pepper and all the beef tasted of pepper.  The bread wasn't toasted but so so soggy and wet.  Crazy considering the au jus was on the side.  I only can think they marinated the beef with green peppers.  You think they would tell you if someone says no green peppers especially if that person had allergies could only imagine. \n\nCalled to talk to owner regarding pita and girl on phone could care less told me he was to busy to come to phone.   Said I could come get pita if I wanted.  Yeah right then my food would be cold.  Said I wanted to talk to owner for credit in future not have my food cold.  She lays phone down here him start to yell at her for forgetting pita.  I then decided not worth it won't be returning anyways and hung up.\n\nGot me thinking either he can't pay adequate people or hires inadequate people.   \n\nWhen Inwas in restaurant industry if customers call due to you forgetting something first thing was apologize and ask what you can do to make it up or get there info and comp something next visit.  \n\nLast visit for us here."
4,I luh dis place. I came here for the first time over Thanksgiving Break and it is probably my new go to sushi place when I'm visiting the Chandler/Gilbert area. Pricing? Great! Sushi? Great! The uniqueness of the belt sets it apart from other Sushi restaurants as well and I honestly feel like it is faster than ordering off a card. All in all I am extremely excited to visit again.
1,"In search of food and out of the blistering heat of 103 degrees of Las Vegas, we ended up here just because we couldn't walk any farther. My soles were getting blisters.\nThe pitcher of margarita was average, but the steak nachos were awful!. The chips and steak were dry and no flavors were flattering my taste buds. At least the presentation was pretty...haha\n\nThat's what happens when you're desperate and don't read Yelp reviews."
0,Couldn't sit us..very unhappy with the customer service here. I wouldn't recommend this place they're very mean to there customers who have been waiting for a long time..
2,"Very crowded on a Saturday, but it was race day and game day.  Food was super.  Service was slow.  But again, it was very crowded.  We eventually had to leave because the DJ music was just simply unbearably loud."
0,"What a huge disappointment. Was really in the mood. First the guy gets the order wrong and is slow to correct the mistake. I order grilled chicken. Seems  simple.\nI have never seen or tasted chicken that looked more like sundries dog turds.\nDry, causing me to choke. You can tell I am loving this place. The man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order. The girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless. Sound good? Took two bites and left. Wondered why I took a second bite.\nSick. They could have cared less. Oh the rice was mushy. Slice of cucumber"
1,"Checking in takes a long time.  Hotel needs to have more front desk personnel assigned at the check in desk.  This is the guests first impression and it gets ruined when guests have to wait in a long time.  There were only 2-3 employees attending the front desk.  The elevator connected to the garage is a joke.  They really need to upgrade it.  On the bottom floor, they had a huge fan blowing into the elevator closet, I guess it gets over-heated and malfunctions...that's a safety issue.  NOTE:   If you park on the 3rd floor of the garage, you can bypass the garage elevator and walk into the hotel and take the hotel guest room hotel-musch FASTER!"
2,"So the dry cleaning was ok, customer service was average at best but the prices are crazy for what you get. CRAZY. No thanks."
2,"Confession time...  I'm a Home Depot guy.  I love HD and rarely venture out to a Lowes store.  However, we happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in for a stroll.  All things being equal, if you have seen one Lowes - you've seen them ALL.\n\nYet this one was a little different.  A little cleaner.  Newer, Nicer.  I liked it."
2,"I was so excited to try this, but was bummed by the service/food.\n\nWe had a party of 4 and waited almost an hour to get a table on a busy sunday. That's fine, no complaints from me on that. We get seated and it takes a long time for someone to take our drink orders. There were several waiters/people in suits walking around but no one helping us. Finally they take the order. Hibiscus cocktail was pretty cool but a bit overpriced. \n\nWe order some beignets and some bread with jams. The waiter misinterpreted our beignet order, so he brought us out two orders. He never got us the bread, but we were thinking we'd gotten enough food so we didn't mention it. The beignets were pretty good, not amazing and not worth the price.\n\nOur waiter paid very little attention to us in general. We were 4 girls so I guess we;re notoriously bad tippers, but we all have disposable income and tip well so that was obnoxious. Our food took another 40 mins to come out.\n\nI had chicken and waffles, which is supposed to be their best dish but I was unimpressed. The waffles were super bland and the vanilla butter wasn't amazing. The chicken was the best part though, very flavorful and well cooked.\n\nThe food was decent, not worth the price though considering the service. It was pretty awful. I think we just had a bad waiter, but it soured the entire experience for me."
2,"I only go here on occasion but I like the drink I order, the place is always clean, and prices are fine. I have never eaten here before so I can't really comment on that."
4,"My go to place for special occasions, and celebrations. Amazing food and amazing service. The special is always outstanding. The Sweet Potato Ravioli lives up to it's reputation. My favorite restaurant in Charlotte."
2,"OK. I'm a CenPho snob. A yelp elitist. I admit it. I own it. So when I found out I was going to Peoria for an event, I had already formed my opinion. Cheesey place with cheesey people. God, I love being right! This place is HUGE. Over 14,500 square feet of restaurant, bar, stage and patio space. The event was very disorganized and it was difficult getting a server. I can't knock the restaurant so much for this. And I'll yelp the event seperately. It seems as thoug the food du jour at restaurants everywhere is an upscale macaroni and cheese. And SKYE serves there's with chunks of lobster. Dee lish. Of course you could serve mac n cheese with human toes and I'd still scrape the plate with my fingers. The steak sticks were like skewers of shoe leather. Only leather would have been tastier. The calamari was crisp and tender served with sweet and sour and marinara sauces. Rickie's filet was devoured in seconds. So I'm assuming thumbs up on that. I wasn't feeling the pinot grigio so I switched to chilled Patron and Coronas. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Probably should have stopped drinking before midnight. But. I didn't. I guess if you live out here, this could be a happening place. It just ain't happening for me."
2,"Good things about the hotel: the view of our room was great, the location wasn't bad, about 20min walking from old town, the staff was helpful. \nBad things: rooms are old and  in need renovation, there are homeless people everywhere close to the hotel, room had no fridge. We parked in another parking lot, because our truck didn't fit in the parking lot next to the hotel, and we actually paid way less ($9/night)."
0,"As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, then heavily discount them (kinda like cheap used car dealers of old.) But the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management. They did not listen and therefore prescribed the wrong fix at inflated pricing. When I asked questions in an attempt to get them to better understand the issue, I was told, \""maybe you should just fix it yourself.\"" In addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized. The experience led me to leave their facility, do some research, and actually fix it myself. Their quote was $2000, my cost ended up at $750. The combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must come from their near monopoly in Phoenix for Club Car. I would push my car off a cliff and buy an EZGO before I would ever do business with them."
0,"Kudos to the food but customer service sucks. We ordered through the phone and the lady that was getting our order was BEYOND rude, I wasn't even done ordering and she told me to remind her about my drinks cuz she's busy and hung up. My friends and I go there to pick up our food and there wasn't any barely people! To top it off super bad attitude when I asked a question. I'd rather go to Don Tortaco right next door, food is great and customer service is amazing!"
2,This is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime I've been there the service is really slow and crappy.\n\nWas there for dinner on Monday and whilst there wasn't many people in there we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to order the appetizer... with our food btw.\n\nBut their bread rocks at the beginning of the meal and the chicken marsalla is so awesome as is the goulash and mostly everything else.  The cheesecake is the best i've ever had even though I don't get it everytime... not a huge sweets guy but it is really good.\n\nI'd still say go but be patient...
4,"Bonaparte is one of the classiest, ritziest, most fantastical restaurants I have ever been to. The food, the atmosphere, and the service are fantastic. You will pay for it, but it is an experience and worth it. The Dover entree is amazing and easily top 5 fish dish I have ever eaten. Foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is fantastic and I am almost sure everything served at Bonaparte is as well. \n\nThe menu can be a bit confusing but basically you can order a la carte or choose a 5 course tasting menu."
1,"JUST WANTED WINGS !!!\nSat at the bar and ordered wings.. service was ok BUT !!  I ordered HOT and they were not even close to hot. They charge like 1.25 for ANY sauce to dip, even the 1st one YIKES !!  Nothing says dont come back better than that. Next night we went to Dick's in Excaliber and had there wings  WOW !!  What a difference in wings and no charge for the dressing."
3,"I was feeling blue do to the passing of my cat & wandered into the adoption center at this petco location just to see what kind of animals they had for adoption. Amber was so helpful and friendly . She was never pushy and let me know about each cat witch really made the decision making process very easy. If you are looking to get a new pet friend , the people here really care . Thank you Petco ."
1,"Why so stingy with the chips and salsa?  If you don't ask for chips and salsa, they don't offer them  Weird.  Also, to the waitress who picked up my wine glass before I finished my wine...your tip was reduced.  A good server will know not to do that.  Also, the music is way too loud for a small restaurant."
2,The fried fish taco was good. I thought it would be better. The homemade salsa was OK. Very fresh though. The jalapeno marg was pretty good but not worth $9.\n\nThe avocado pasta side was the best part. And I did like the tortilla.
0,"This place is closed.\nToo bad, I was looking for a place like this."
4,"Hands down one of my favorite places to stop in on the strip. Everything is so cheap, no-nonsense, no attitude kind of place.  The first time I went here was when my buddy and I were hopping into every place we found on our first trip to Vegas. I've been coming back ever since.\n\nThe sign drawing you in reads \""$2 jager, $3 crown, $4 patron\"". A nice change from a lot of the other Vegas cars that would be $10, $14 and $16 for those same drinks with the attitude either stirred in or on the side. The deals seem to change regularly but most recently it was $2.50 for an Alaskan Amber lager and a hot dog. This is a Vegas Must-Do!"
4,"Whenever I'm in Las Vegas I always, always try to hit this place. This place is part bistro and part fancy schamncy restaurant. Now if you can get a table at the outside patio with a view of the Bellagio, that's pretty nice. That's where it feels like a fancy restaurant. But inside it's dimly lit, intimate, feels like a second dining room; and that's the bistro feeling.\n\nLook to spend about $30 to $50 a person. Expensive, yes. But SOOO worth it. If you're going to eat at a place like Mon Ami Gabi, you MUST eat everything, meaning every course...appetizers , entree and dessert. Plus some wine, and you are set. Now what I usually order every time I'm here is that I start with the house Merlot. Then for my appetizer, I go for the crab cakes, there are only 2 of them but they taste really good. Then my main course would be the Filet Mignon, medium well. Awesome and they serve it with pomme frites (French fries). Altogether I am in heaven, pure heaven. I usually variate what my dessert would be I think I usually get the strawberry crepe or the sorbet.\n\nNow getting a table here can be difficult. I usually call four hours before my dinner time, meaning I reserve a table. But usually before 7pm, you should be able to get a table. I think it gets crazy at sundown and everyone wants a table at night to watch the fountain show at Bellagio.\n\nFor me its the perfect place to eat. It doesn't try to hard to be the best or the prettiest. It just does what it should, serve great food, give great service, have a great atmosphere and cook a great steak!"
4,Pretty much the best place to get a morning bun that I can currently think of.
1,"I have an appreciation for nice things and high quality merchandise. Sadly like many other \""big name\"" brands everything looks like everything and everyone else....That is unless the logo or the branding is marked all over the entire thing. Who cares what purse, wallet, scarf, etc you have.....Unless you want the world to know how much money you spend on something...."
0,"First I'd just like to mention that they do not accept the check-in offer any more. Apparently, this offer was from the previous owner. They really need to remove this offer from yelp because it is quite deceiving. Now on to the food; we ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni/sausage & 1/2 chicken/mushroom. The crust was crispy on some pieces & soggy on others. The sauce was a bit bland, it really could use some flavor. The chicken also didn't taste that great. My husband said the pepperoni/sausage was just meh. Overall we didn't really enjoy the pizza. It was pricey & the quality was not that great. So if I were you i'd skip this place and go somewhere else."
4,"I ordered a hot double espresso here and a cold Granita mixed coffee blend with whipped cream.\n\nThe espresso was so much smoother and less bitter than Starbucks, true quality\nespresso beans right there. This flavor can only be established with the freshest \nquality espresso beans that have been properly held, sealed, and cool. I also believe that the pouring and grinding of the fresh beans to order makes a huge difference and you cannot down play enough the quality of coffee that is pressed versus shot through a machine.\n\nI will go here more frequently now for sure."
1,"What do you do when a restaurant has great food, but can't get their service together? Go somewhere else; there's plenty of great food out there.\n\nTaste of Dahntahn sets you up for disappointment from the get-go. The name conjures images of native Pittsburghers in their black and gold, eating pierogis and chip-chopped ham, and \""warshing it dahn\"" with an IC Light. Aside from the name and pierogis on the menu, nothing here says Pittsburgh. Large cut-outs of Marilyn and Elvis, multicolored abstract art, a Hollywood poster and lots of red in the front room - just what are they trying to be?\n\nThere is a huge, cool backlit menu sitting on the table when you arrive. One menu. I want my own menu. Now, the missus and I like to plan our meals (calorie counting) by going to the website ahead of time. Don't bother. The website is not up-to-date. For that matter, neither is the menu. On November 14(!) our cool backlit menu had their summer caprese salad, which is not available.\n\nOur server placed bread plates on the table after we placed our order.  After we finished our salads (Artisan Field Greens; Beet Salad - delicious, btw) I asked our server. \""Was there bread.\"" \""Oh, you didn't get bread? I'll make sure our manager gets you some.\"" The bread arrived as we were finishing our entrees (Virginia Spots; Deconstructed Lasagne - also delicious).\n\nOur drinks (water, iced tea, coffee) were never refilled without asking. Sometimes we asked and were forgotten.\n\nGreat food? Sure. Going back? Probably not."
1,"This branch is so slow, especially around 10 am to 2 pm.  Always seems to have 10 employees but only 3 windows open.  Random employees walking around saying \""thanks for coming in today\"" \""how's your day going\"". My day was going well until I came in.  I recommend using the atm for every possible thing that  the atm dose, instead of going inside."
1,"I've wanted to try this place for a while so went over for lunch. The menu they hand out has items that are not on the board and the \""lines\"" were disorganized for ordering. I ordered one of the pizzas that support a charity. The food took way too long to receive and although I really like arugula, I also paid for prosciutto and it was sorely lacking. Not sure I would try again. They've had enough time to figure things out. Cool vibe but parking is also,a challenge."
0,"A co-worker recommended this place, so my sister and I went for dinner.  All in all I just wasn't impressed with this restaurant, so much so that I won't be back.\n\nThe decor is psychadelic 60's.  Well, actually, it seemed to flux from random things of the 60's, such as bands or movies, to just psychadelic looking stickers.  It seemed like they were just desperate to fill in every empty space on their walls.  It's a bit over the top when you walk in, but I can understand the fun for people that particularly enjoy that decade.  I don't happen to and even if I did like the 60's, their decor could have been way less cheesy and still been faithful to the theme.\n\nEach table has books, toys or memorablia from that same decade, which I thought was interesting, especially since our table featured a Greatest Edition of Archie Comics, which I loved when I was a little girl.  Obviously the music they play is from the 60's and they even show muted Ed Sullivan Show clips on a large television.\n\nWhen we placed our orders, I told the waitress that I had wanted a hamburger, so she recomended the special which was a Rambo Burger.  The menu didn't really give a description on the specials part, so I ordered it.  It came out with shredded barbecue beef on top and an onion ring.  I really just wanted a simple burger and had there been a description when I ordered, I would have picked something else.  Still, when I scraped off the extra meat and put the onion ring to the side, it was a decent burger.  Actually, the quality of the burger is why this review is two stars instead of just one, espcially when my sister didn't like her chicken Alfredo.\n\nAll in all, I wasn't impressed with the service and when we got our bill I was shocked when our total came out to close to $40.00.  Like I said, the food was good, but I can't spend that much in what I assumed would be a mom and pop style establishment.\n\n1/9/2013 (Response to Owner's Comments)\n\nIf there's one thing that kinda irks me, it's the inability to quietly take a less than positive review and use it constructively instead of trying to defend youself against one person's bad experience.  I'm ALWAYS more than willing to give a second chance, and if you check my past reviews, most locations get a better review from the first time when I wasn't impressed.  This owner response was that second chance.  However, since the owner(?) was able to go into better detail of my review, I figured I would and could afford him the same courtesy.\n\n1. Cost: I hold in my hand my receipt from Rambo's Kitchen dated 12/26/12 for the total amount of $36.36 (\""close to $40.00\"").  Now, even though I wasn't that impressed with the service, it wasn't horrible, so I decided to round up my bill with a tip of $3.64, more for my convenience than for the server's reward.  Hence, my bill came to $40.00.  Now, the reason for the increase in my bill is because I failed to mention the \""$5.00\"" milkshake that we also ordered.  My apologies and the subject of my next issue.\n\n2. \""$5.00 Milkshake\"": I love the name of that item, all I can think of is Vincent Vega and his outrage that something made of milk and ice cream can cost $5.00.  Of course, when he tasted Mia Wallace's shake, he had to agree that it was an amazing shake.  I couldn't.  The ice cream they used must have been thawed and then refrozen, because there were crystalized parts of it that just tasted like straight ice.  It wasn't quite blended well and I'm pretty sure if I was a waitress (as I have been, so I'm speaking from experience) I would have noticed if an item had barely been touched and asked if something was wrong.  I assume this is not a policy at Rambo's, but everyone has their off day and it's not like this is fine dining.  In fact, the person that ordered this shake, took one taste and didn't touch it again, I ate more than her since I didn't want to waste an entire $5.00.\n\n3. Quality of food: I apologize, sincerely, for stating that my sandwich contained beef, it was pulled pork now that I remember it.  I assume that I just glossed over that information and picture on the menu, so I apologize for that as well.  Now, as for the fettucine alfredo.  I had decided that I wouldn't go into detail in my original review, but fair's fair.  My sister loved it.  She brought the rest home to eat the next day.  Of course, when she woke up at two in the morning with stomach pains and spent the rest of the next day glued to the toilet, she instructed me to throw away her takeout food.  I'm not sure if it was undercooked chicken or something else, but the food made her sick.  However, I'll state it once again, my hamburger (once I had scraped off the pulled PORK) was delicious and I didn't get sick.\n\nIn summation, I appreciate the archived positive reviews that were included and wish congratulations on the patrons that enjoyed this restaurant.  I was not one of them and definintely won't be.  Accordingly, I'll remove one star due to owner understanding."
3,"Papas & eggs burrito with a bit of cheese and pico.  Enjoying sitting outside, hanging with family & friends, and splitting this very large burrito!"
0,Read many great reviews about the wonderful customer service but could not even get anyone to call me back.  Finally gave up and went with someone else.
0,"My wife and I have frequented this familiar place for years and loved Ginny's excellent service and personality. She has, as several other posts have indicated, sold the restaurant to new owners and sadly they have changed and not for the better. \n\nThe menu was different. The plating of the food was poorly done. The portions have been scaled back and the prices have been scaled forward. \n\nWe just got back from our LAST VISIT to this place and I was horrified with the poor quality of the food, the service, and we were the only ones in the entire place for quite a while. \n\nIn retrospect, I'm not surprised since everyone that frequented Zorba's apparently already knows what we were terribly disappointed to find out. \n\nI hate to have to write a poor review for a restaurant that we have loved for years. I'm fairly certain, judging by the lack of patronage as well as the poor excuse for Greek food, that this place will close down very soon. \n\nGoodbye Ginny! We will miss your smile, your love, and your wonderful food."
1,"The food is good, but the service is horrible. You got to wait atleast 20 minutes only to place your order. And that's not because of a long line (I'm the third person in the line for last 20 mins). It's just because no one is at the counter taking orders !"
3,Great food. Horrible music ruined patio experience
1,"OK, here's the thing.  My Florist should be the bomb.  It's got the right location, the right crowd and the right vibe (especially when the pianist is on).  The drink menu is inventive, though inconsistently priced, and makes good use of the building's former incarnation with lots of floral inspired beverages.  \n\nMy Florist has been open for years, but it still feels like opening weekend.  Confused host service at the door, no linens or silverware on the table, (our party was actually supplied paper towels that looked like they came straight out of the bathroom dispenser!)  \n\nHow especially unfortunate it was that they were so ill prepared on what could possibly be one of their biggest days of the year: the Willo District Home Tour and Valentine's Day.   Our server had to apologize too many times for the shortcomings of the management, kitchen staff, bar, etc. \n\nAs for the food, I had the turkey and brie, which was passable.  The cranberry relish had an unexpected kick, which I liked, but the pumpernickel bread was dry and hard.  In fact, \""too dry\"" was a common complaint for more than one of my lunch companions, whether it be not enough salad dressing or a Reuben sandwich that was not \""hot and juicy\"" as requested.  (And really, who wants \""too dry\"" on Valentine's Day?)\n\nCome on, guys, get it together.  This could be a great place with some attention to basics."
1,I went there one hour after they opened for a sandwich. The food was OK but they did not have any change. The person who was suppose to open the safe did not show up yet. Person at the counter had to use his own money to give me change.
2,"If I'm 22, this three story behemoth gets five stars. I'm not, but that won't keep me from investigating. \n\nWe stopped in during the game and managed to get a table on the top floor. After some enjoyable people watching of co-eds wearing indescribably sloppy outfits, we hit the road. I can see this place getting rowdy post-game, so this ain't the place to take the 'rents to on parents weekend."
1,"Los tacos al pastor tienen muy buen sabor PEROOOO por $2.00 que cuestan c/u deber\u00edan traer mas carne, si de por si la tortilla es chiquita y luego le ponen MUY POCA carne. El servicio D\u00e9ja tambi\u00e9n mucho que desear"
1,"We saw they averaged very low on yelp but George's Grill was only open for dinner on weekends... Boooo.... The other surrounding places averaged just about the same so we took our chances.\n\nSure enough, service was nonexistent. Our waitress disappeared and never checked back after taking our orders. Actually, she did, at the END of our meal. We gave 3 different people our coffee order which finally came real late. No one refilled anything at our table. \n\nAtmosphere is seemingly nice, private outside patio on higher grounds. Still, fucking shit. Luckily the food was good. Phewww."
3,"Try and get a table along the railing.  The people watching is fantastic.  BUT not as fantastic as the food.  Our steak was incredible:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ?select=eI1BpLd7Cja-w06KiTnekg\n\nWe ordered the grilled asparagus, some other side.... and I was busting at the seams.  Seriously, good food and excellent service."
2,"A great little place to buy a gift...especially if it's for a mother-in-law or your own madre who likes little bottles of lotion or unusual odds and ends, jewelry or things of that nature. What first caught my eye was the card section. It's large and diverse - something for everyone for every occasion. From inspiration quotes on the front to silly photographs, I would definitely hit up this store if I needed to buy a unique card. \n\nWhile I wandered around, I didn't really see anything I (or any of my friends) would like, but I did have the one overwhelming thought, \""This is for mothers.\"" Lotions galore. Burts bees, too. Shiny jewelry. T-shirts. Even a little area for lovers with haven't quite gotten to Rated R (more like PG-17). \n\nAll in all, a fun store. I had a good time looking around and found myself taking mental notes of reasons I could return. All of which included buying a gift for somebody else.\n\nAs for the service, it was not-so-good. I was one of three patrons in the store - even in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. And just as I thought, \""Wow, guady t-shirt!,\"" the sales clerk poked her head around the cash register and asked, \""You still doing okay over there, sweetie?\"" \n\nUhm, minus one star for calling a grown woman \""sweetie.\"""
4,"Found this place after a Yelp search one night after 9PM when every other smoke shop in town is closed.  The fact that they are open late every night gets immediate stars for me.  The selection seemed to be like most other smoke shops, and the prices were average.  The guy working was really cool (and cute :-), and after I mentioned Yelp, he was quite generous with the discount and a freebie lighter."
0,Never again. Small portions and food was not too good. They somehow managed to give me a dry medium rare steak! The steak fries were good but I'm sure they don't cut them there. There were 10 in our party and we were all admiring the kids food cause they at least seemed to be enjoying their chicken fingers and grilled cheese.
3,"Small dining room, not sure there is even a restroom, but clean and service is prompt.  Owners very nice.  Food was excellent.  This thai place is truly thai as far as spices go.  Medium here is like hot elsewhere.  Great for curries!  If ordering anything else, would recommend mild.  Located in an older plaza in Alta Mesa area that looks a little run down.  Lots of parking though!  Would definitely try again, especially if in the mood for that face burning tingle with the hot and spicy.  Mmm."
0,"Avoid like the plague - these guys are completely incompetent.   \n\nI'm not overly demanding: sometimes things are far from perfect, or you'll have some wrinkles or lint.  Fine.  But please don't damage the clothes, simple.    I recently took 3 items to Delia's and all 3 got screwed up in some form - that's a record.   \n\n- A new, dark blue dress shirt I had just bought & worn only once.  The collar was ruined; it was ironed in such a way that ALL of it looked brown and shiny as hell.   Now sometimes this happens as part of the normal wear & tear of clothes, etc, but it's inexcusable for these supposed pros to make it happen on a NEW shirt.   It had never even been washed before, and now the shiny brown collar looks like it's at least a year old.  No excuse for this.\n\n- A brand new casual shirt I had also worn only once.  Next time I wore it, I removed it from the plastic and saw they had ripped one of the buttons off.   Again, if this had been an old shirt, with used-up buttons...hey, it happens.   But this was a brand spanking new shirt too.  This tells me they're not treating the clothes the way they should, nor do they bother to tell you when they rip off your buttons on a new shirt.\n\n- Linen pants - a minor gripe, but even though I asked for it to be ironed with no crease down the center and saw the instruction being included in my order......that's right, they couldn't follow directions, because it was not done this way.\n\nNow, things often happen at dry cleaner establishments - accidents, misunderstandings, etc - but these should be random, isolated incidents at worst.   Delia's is 0 for 3 on a single batch, which tells me they're just not the place to go.  Ever.\n\nAdmittedly, the customer service is great, they have things on time, and the market heavily with discounts and such.   But all these things are worthless if the quality of the core service is subpar.   This company needs to get back to basics."
4,"I just feel compelled to again state how much I freakin' love this place\n\nI think its super.\n\nLast time I branched out and ordered a filet (my bf ordered ribs and then we split to make for a delicious mixed meal)\n\nOMG\nTHE FILET WAS AMAZING!\n\nLike, better than high end steakhouses.\nI love this place.\n\nJust wish it were closer to me!"
0,"We had girl's night dinner here and had a horrible experience. This was one of the worst snobby waitress stories I've ever had the \""pleasure\"" of telling.\n\nFirst, we walked in and it took 10 minutes for someone to come to the counter to consider seating us.\n\nSecond, or waitress was a jerk. I wish we got her name, because I would call her out on here (just in case, she's a skinny, pear-shaped woman with shoulder-length, brunette hair with bangs and a mousy face). She was not very attentive. It was busy, but we had to ask her for water quite a few times. We ordered our drinks and food (which took forever to come out, we had to ask if they forgot about our order)--one of the girls didn't realize her salad came with salmon (to be fair, the ingredients aren't on the menu), so she was going to scrape it out. The waitress sighed and said she'd have them remake it. My friend tried to say it was ok, but the waitress took it anyway. For the rest of our dining experience, water was scarce.\n\nThen the real problem came.  We waited 30 minutes after we finished our dinner to get our check. Our waitress told us that she doesn't split checks (we are not sure if this is company policy or not). When she brought the check back, we split it up so she could charge all of our cards correctly. She said this was fine. She came back 15 minutes later and told us that we hadn't added a salad onto our cards. We had ordered 3 salads total. She had charged us for 4. We told her her mistake. She said she'd fix it.\n\nShe came back and gave us our checks and we were ALL mischarged (most of us over charged). We figured out through the math of all of our receipts that she had charged us for the salad, but had split up the costs on all of our checks. We told her this problem, and she responded with, \""This is why we don't split checks.\"" We were very taken aback, but one of our girls said, \""If you would have split the check, we wouldn't have had this problem.\"" She rolled her eyes and walked away.\n\nLastly, the food was ok, but I don't like much American Food. There are hardly any vegetarian options and no vegan options.\n\nI wouldn't recommend eating here and I will never go again unless I have to."
2,"Went to Parma last night for dinner, first time. Went based on Yelp and other reviews being outstanding. It was disappointing. Got there just before they reopened at 5:05. Were seated fairly quickly, being we were the only customers, but the person who seated us seemed put out because we didn't have a reservation. One server took our orders (we had 3 serve us, the original was started serving a party and just ignored us) and disappeared, only saw him once until the check, which he delivered after we asked for it.  We got the appitizer of portabello mushrooms with spinich and melted cheese--was VERY GOOD, but delivered by another server. I was thinkiing this was going to be as good as the reviews. This is when the service deteriorated. Our drinks were empty from the time the app came until our entrees, mine a full 3 minutes before the rest of the table was served their entrees. I got the special, veal over brocolini, tasty but not remarkably so. The side of fettucini with sunday sauce was plain, not much taste. My wife had the ravioli, sauce runny, ravioli need to bathe in the boiling water for another minute or two, very very aldente and overall plain. Another in our party got the lasagna, said was plain lasagna nothing special. The overall meal was just plain, not much flavor to the food, except the app. Service was spotty at best. I rated a 3 because of the app and my entree, would have been a 2 for service and the other entrees. Sorry to burst the 5 star bubble for some, but I call them as I see them. For the money I will go to Carrabas."
2,"Gold Spike has a new face...and it's laughing at the strip-joints!  I stayed in a room that easily would've whooped the best chain motel by $60 and all I had to do was go down an elevator and plop my ass down in a seat and start paying BJ...WHOA!  6:5 payout on BJ?!  Sorry Goldy, I'll be taking my gaming money someplace else. The 24/7 restaurant is more diner than restaurant but the prices don't hurt...I had the $5.99 Prime Rib deal and it was just OK...(Magnolia's beats it BAD for $2 more).   By the way...I don't know where YOU gamble - but you should NEVER play a 6:5 payout BJ game - EVER!"
4,"I made my first visit here in November 2013. I found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. I was very happy with my visit with Dr. Mills. I can tell that he thinks critically about all the information I provide, and when he arrives at a recommendation he is very articulate. His approach made me feel comfortable and at ease."
1,"I'm only rating this 2 stars, only because Linda saved them from having 1. (Only cause I can't go any lower) \nFirst off I was referred here by plenty of my girlfriends, I normally have my go to girl but I needed my nails done like at that time so I drive 20 minutes out of my way to wild orchid. \n\nI walk in NOBODY CUSTOMERS so of course I was like yay no wait. I was asked what would I like done I told them pedi and fill. Linda starts my pedi and half way in my pedi I get told sorry can you come back tomorrow there's nobody here to do your nails. So now I'm kind of upset if I would have known that I would have never started my pedi. \nThen as I was getting ready to leave Carey told me if I'd like her to do my nails she will right after her client she was working on. I waited an hour and I gave up o was so over it that I wasted my time. Whether someone was booked or not at the time of them asking me what would I like to have done I feel I should have been informed that there was an appt coming in or whatever. I'm beyond annoyed still. To top it off for a BASIC pedi was 30  I think with Carey's work they have became really cocky and stop caring about new cilents. The attitude in here is really not welcoming at all."
3,"ULTA and their buy 1 get 1 50% off gets me! well organized from brands, skin care, hair care, perfumes/colognes, etc. love love love. it's good that it's a one stop shop for drugstore brands and/or higher end brands. the ladies are helpful. also is a even more convienent location being theres a couple shoe stores and clothing stores including target, nordstrom rack. so you can go shopping and check out beauty supplies in the same area!"
2,Stick with the beers at this place.  Their beers were superb but their apps were so-so.  Had the lobster tacos and the fois gras peanut butter and jelly.  Both were ok.
2,"The Dowd has great facilities, large locker rooms complete with Steam and Sauna facilities, every fitness class you can think of, basketball courts, a pool...\n\nIt's the ideal place to go to stay fit.\n\nThe one drawback is that it's not without some sketchy activity.  Recently, I was changing after a workout, and I saw these two guys walking around the locker room.  I didn't think much of it, but someone who was changing beside me said,\n\""Hey - what are you two doing?\""\n\""Nothin man, we're waitin for ****\""\n\""I see you casin' the place, I left for a shower you were walkin around, I get back from my shower, you still walkin around\""\n\""No man, we're just waitin for ****\""\n\nSo the guy who is calling these two sketchy dudes out walks over to the emergency phone, picks it up and calls the front desk.\n\nThe two sketchy dudes, are acting all tough and cool about it, but literally proceed to walk out of the locker room, up the stairs and out of the building.  \n\nI happened to finish up around that same time, and walked out about a minute after them.  I saw them get into their car and drive off - so much for waiting for their \""friend\""!\n\nAs I'm watching them leave, another guy who left at the same time as me and was headed home or to work or something says to me,\n\n\""I can't believe it - they were definitely here looking to get into people's lockers\""\n\""Yea, definitely, I'm surprised\"", I reply\nThe guy says to me \""I actually had my locker broken into here not too long ago, my wallet was stolen...\""\n\nThe moral of the story is this - either bring a freakin masterlock with you, or don't change at the gym and just enjoy the facilities!\n\nOh and one more thing - for the money?  the Y charges you based on your income, so if you make decent money, you'll spend $100 a month for 2 people.  That to me is a bit on the pricey side..."
1,"Don't touch that it's hot - nothing makes you want to touch something more.  Only for Desert Ridge it's \""This place is full of underdressed teenage girls and douche-bag teenage boys\"". I know I know - you just can't resist going. \n\nIf you are over 35 there is nothing here for you but food and beer and a cold hard scare of the generation that will be caring for your ass."
3,"Old Navy is one of those places that I totally forgot existed until my sister became employed there. Now, I shop here at least twice a month. They are forever having some kind of clearance or sale going on and they a lot of sizes. I believe they go from an XS to a XXL, however, if they do not have your size in stock, they will call over to the West side Old Navy or order it for you online. I have found it that online does have more plus size apparel. They sale shoes, accessories, skirts, dresses, shorts, hats, bags, graphic t-shirts and so on. Great store to go to if you're looking for a nice spring dress for a great price. You can also apply for a credit card and get approved immediately."
2,"Wanted to try SS for a long time, and now that I was staying @ Palazzo, I had to get in there. We went for an early dinner on a weekday. The place was empty, and we were seated right away. The menu was honestly, somewhat intimidating, and really shi shi. I like sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. I didnt really vibe with the brazilian twist the menu had. I did not research the menu enough before going in there. (Which was good in retrospect, because then I probably wouldnt have gone there, and missed a great meal.) I assumed- sushi samba= sushi. Lol. We ordered regular sushi rolls, sashimi pieces and miso soups. The miso was great. The grade of the sushi was out of this world. Def some of the best I have had, and I am a sushi addict. I have eaten it all over at home, and I try to get it whenever I am on vacation. Def recommend. There are high prices for the specialty fusion foods (which made me nervous and therefore I stuck with what I knew), but the place is gorgeous, service was fantastic, and if you are willing to take a chance on the specialty foods, Im sure you wont be disappointed."
0,Worst customer service I pick up my food in drive thru the girl at the window had attitude first she gave me the wrong food order & I told her thank you 2 times n she just ignore me what a customer service never going back again
0,"I loathe this place. Partly because its a faux Irish pub*, partly because the service sucks and the food is mediocre at best. \n\nI go to bars for good drinks and good food.  If the staff is hot girls in skimpy outfits, that can be a bonus, not a replacement for the other two.\n\nThere are places doing the \""hot waitstaff\"" concept much better, find one and go there. Or better yet, find a bar you like that just happens to have a cute bartender, and be a regular there!\n\n*True story, was once having a bad day and needed a good Irish whiskey to cheer me up. I asked what their selection was and after ~5 minutes of searching their backbar they found a (singular) dusty bottle of bushmill's. Nothing else... weak sauce!"
2,"Greasy breakfasts and poutine with smoked meat - that's why we stop into La Belle Province.  Also, it's proximity to La Carrefour Laval makes it an ideal pit stop before a shopping frenzy.\n\nI discovered this location of the chain La Belle Province a few years ago when we were in town for a friend's wedding.  We had to run to the mall to pick up a few things we forgot to pack and thought we'd swing in for a quick pre-wedding poutine.   Now it's just part of the La Carrefour routine.\n\nI ordered the large poutine with smoked meat ($7.99) while others ordered the hot chicken sandwich, breakfast with 2 eggs and the club sandwich with fries.  \n\nTo our surprise, there's a small patio attached with a few tables and umbrellas.  Sure, the scenery isn't that impressive - suburban houses and industrial parkway - but it was nice to eat our greasy diner food outdoors.\n\nStaff is always friendly and willing to accommodate food allergies.  Food is diner quality but good in a pinch."
4,Thors soo fresh & soo clean clean!
4,good food !!! I tried combination hibachi and it was absolutely delicious.  I'm in Charlotte only for a week and I'm gonna come again.
0,"This is perhaps the worst service I've experienced from any sushi restaurant. I was out to dinner with 2 friends & after reading the reviews this place relieved, it sounded fantastic. After the first round of orders the quality of the service & sushi went down drastically. The server let us sit for 15min after taking our plates from the first order before returning to take our follow up orders. When the 2nd order had been placed, our server returned 10min later & rudely questioned if we could even finish our order. This led to another 10min wait before receiving our food. I understand having to serve & accommodate other orders/customers, but the delivery of our food was a slow & drawn out process, especially when compared to the super quick food drops when we first sat down. Sushi that was supposed to be hot was cold, & the cold sushi was warm as if it had been sitting out. At this point we knew we were no longer wanted. After flagging down our server, we requested dessert along with the bill. The mochi was on point, but the tempura ice cream was presented in a soggy condition, ending our evening at this establishment. All of this & they had the nerve to ask for a 12% percent gratuity on the check. They treated us horribly as customers. We were not loud in anyway,  rude or disrespectful in any manner, or deserving of this horrendous customer service. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday.  I had never been to Four Peaks before but have driven by it and seen how busy and opted to go somewhere else due to lack of parking.  We were lucky to have found a spot about a block away so we decided to check out the place.  It was a hot muggy day and we thought some nice cold beers would hit the spot.  We arrived at the front of the place to see about five people standing around at the hostess spot, not one of them said Hi.  I had to say two please and interrupt their conversation.  We got seated in the back and right away the heat just hit me when I sat down.  I started sweating.  No ac, really?  We are in phoenix and people still use swamp coolers?  Anyways I was uncomfortable and noticed everyone was sweating, like beast. I looked around and saw a lot of college students sitting about and thought to myself... geez this isn't where I would go to pick up on someone, everyone is sweating and looks gross.  \nI know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me.  I love four peaks beers normally, but when my server came with my beer it was warm, not refreshing when sitting and sweating.  Food was average, typical bar food.\nOur server was ok for it being so busy, but I didn't get the warm and fuzzies with her attitude. Wonder if this review will be axed by yelp?? hmm.."
4,"I had to go to the hospital last night, so I went to Banner on Meeker in Sun City West. Very close to home. The service was great! From the friendly check in staff to the back office nurses. I was in the waiting room less than 16 minutes before they took me back for triaging and assessment. They were extremely busy and still managed to provide great service, quick service and with caring smile. I love this hospital. Thank you Banner Team for caring."
1,"Yawn. Boring and waaaay too expensive. Admission price is ridiculous  and I was in a foul mood once inside thinking how the place basically raped me, but not in the way I would have preferred. Where's the midgets and donkeys I ask you?\n\nThis stupid bouncer character standing around noticed that our group was basically just watching the stage shows from the back and not \""participating\"" so he felt he had to comment. \""C'mon guys, what are you guys gay?\"" WTF? Why cuz we're not stupid idiots spending hundreds for lap dances on chicks who are so transparent about their desire for cash (c'mon make the customer feel special or something) then we must be into our own sex? C'mon playa, I'm horny but not as stupid as some, and fo sho not as pitiful in my life that the only job I can get is bouncing at a strip joint. Not knocking the girls cuz they're the talent...but you my friend are just that lame who can't do anything but stand for hours acting like he's keeping things safe cuz he can't do anything better in life to earn money. Go stand outside and frisk people or something...just do something productive...but don't leer behind guys acting like you're somebody.\n\nThese strip joints put me to sleep. Next..."
0,"Avoid this hotel.  The rooms and hallways felt somewhere between cheap dormitory and prison.  Walls are not very soundproof, I heard yelling in the next room until 4 am.  The overall feel is dirty, in spite of the sanitation score listed in the lobby.  Did not feel safe trying the free breakfast, so I have no idea how it was."
3,"Steakhouses in Vegas are like Starbucks in the USA... they're everywhere. If you're passing by a nice restaurant in a hotel casino, there's a good chance that it's a steakhouse. Maybe Vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...\n\nSome friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n\nOne friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n\nDelmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!"
3,"In general I love the cheesecake factory.  We'd not had a great experience at this one last time, so I wasn't sure about trying it again, but we were please. The service was pretty good and the food was quite good.  I had the endive, pecan and blue cheese salad and my husband had the ahi tuna app...both very nice.  We will return."
2,"Was disappointed, used to go to the Coach and Willies down the street, and do go to the Coach and Willies in Chandler.   Big difference,  the day we were there they were short handed on a Saturday afternoon.  Noisy,  slow service and had one beer and left after we couldn't get the time of day.   Looked like the Mgr. was trying to help.  There was a Civic Center event of some sort.  We drove from Chandler to try it out..  To top it off we had to sit at the bar next to a couple that looked homeless and was sharing a beer.   Gave it 3 stars just because of Coach and Willies respect."
4,"You'd be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place, tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street, but in my opinion that's half of it's charm. It's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality, not because it's in your face.\n\nIt's easy to see why. When you step inside it's like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace, with the green leafy plants and water feature. Rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it, next to the fresh flowers, and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusive.\n\nAlthough it's never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh, you do get what you pay for. That said, at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their \""Better By Half\"" promos on: glasses of house wine, selected cocktails, selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment. I've been making the most of these offers every time I'm out for fear that they might finish soon, but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet. Happy Days.\n\nI've only ever drunk here, but one of these days I will be going for food... the plates I've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous. There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz, but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof."
1,"I was really disappointed with Kabuki, their appetizer dishes and rolls were not what I thought they would be, and not only that, I found a hair in one of my rolls! Needless to say, I sent back the rolls, and asked for the cheque. I did not want to make a fuss so I paid for what we ate, minus the rolls and left. \n\nWill not be returning, as even without the hair incident, the place wasnt a standout."
3,lots of high end name brand shops but pretty nice
0,Nasty sales reps.. She told me my legs were too fat to fit in the rain boots!! They fit with lots of room!! Idiots!! Never shopping at burberry again!! I don't know how the sales reps even keep customers in the store!!
0,"This place was tasty. That's the only thing they had going for them. Portions are ridiculously small for the price. Pretty sure I didn't order off of the kids meal... Took 20 minutes to get my order. For $10 I got 2 tacos 1 empenda, a tiny soda that was gone before I got my food and chips and salsa... Oh wait... When I got to work I found out they forgot my chips. What a waste of space. Zero stars if I could."
4,"Mongolian BBQ...On the NW corner of Thomas & 15th AvenueLove this place!  ...If you go here, get the Stir Fry in the front!...I love to add my own ingredients into my bowl which they take from you & stir it all up with the sauce of your choice. Very hearty, lots of food. Always hot & fresh! Very friendly!"
0,"I will NEVER visit this place again. The service was unbelievably slow, the food lukewarm and unappetizing, the layout uninviting, the chairs uncomfortable and did I mention how bad the service was?\n\n It took 45 minutes to get our food, and my companion's food and mine didn't even come out at the same time! I got mine at least 10 minutes before he got his. The table just behind us came in at approximately the same time we did and didn't even get their order (just some fries, as far as I could tell) until we were almost finished with our entrees!\n\nIt was also very confusing as to whether we were supposed to order at the counter or not. It seemed as though it was counter service, and they took our order and told us to take any table we liked, but when we sat down at a table to wait for our food a \""server\"" came by and told us we should have ordered from her! Wait, what?\n\nWe had the red velvet cake for dessert (we had to, they were OUT of everything else) and found it unimpressive. I realize its not easy to make vegan desserts, but really I've had much much better than this. \n\nIf this is truly the best in Vegas that vegetarians and vegans have to look forward to, I am very, very sorry."
0,"This is the worst Holiday Inn I have every stayed at. Whether it was Hotels.com fault or Holiday Inns fault I'm not sure. When I booked it was for 2 King bed suite. When we arrived I was told that no room in the hotel has 2 king beds. When we went to get the bedding for the pull out bed we found a package of syringes and the next day found a spoon that had obviously been used to cook heroin or crack that was left by the coffee packet. I guess they don't really clean the rooms. I arrived Thursday and left Sunday and could not get the manager, Angel Ortiz to call me. If i could give negative stars I would. The only redeeming quality was Sara at the front desk who was always apologetic and tried to do everything she could to help."
1,"Good is great here. The service was sub par though. Very surprising, but fairly unfriendly in the bar area, and very slow in the restaurant. I have been several times, and it seems like something has changed here--I past visits the place was great. We will probably opt for another place next time."
4,Long overdue writing a review of my favorite local breakfast place!  Ingredients are fresh and menu is pretty diverse.  Big fan of the Lozoya sandwich for lunch and the Carmelized banana pancakes for breakfast!  \n\nGood to see them getting recognition from Phoenix Mag and the Food Network
3,"Razzy my Razzy!  Time for another end-of-summer review.  Yes I know I've been here a few times this summer, but it's been a hectic one and I've taken a little break from Yelping!\n\nAnyway, much like my review last year, the days and nights are cooling off a little bit and there's still a little time left to take a walk for some yummy treats with your significant other.  So how 'bout some original flavor topped with pineapple and white chocolate?  Yum!"
3,"I can't really believe I had been in Charlotte for a couple years before going to this store.\n\nIt's true that it's a little pricey for your every day grocery shopping, but man, this place is great for people in and around uptown (including Plaza Midwood) who need a Whole Foods/Earth Fare type store without driving to shopping mall land.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of this store, to me, is the bulk food selection.  They have an astounding variety of dried fruit, nuts, grain, teas, spices, etc.  I loaded up when I went.  You can buy a jar of paprika at HT for about $4.00, or you can get the same amount at Healthy Home Market for about $.50\n\nThe beer selection is otherworldly, truly impressive, and they have a lot of wine, too.\n\nBig, big relief to find this place finally."
4,"As opulent as the Bellagio hotel may be, it balances itself with two FREE offerings: The Fountain Show and the Conservatory & Botanical Garden.  Both of which are beautiful sights to be seen.  \n\nWhat I love most about the garden is that it is ever changing with the seasons.  I can't say for certain how often the scenery changes, but it's always fun to see what the creators have come up with.  The Winter/Holiday season is always my favorite, maybe more so because of my love for the holiday season, but it really transforms the area into a magical place.  \n\nThis place is most definitely photo-snapping-central; but on the upside, everyone else is taking pictures so you won't feel out of place trying to capture the perfect shot.  But, once you've gone around once and taken all of the pictures you can, my advice is to put the camera away and walk around once more to truly appreciate these living works of art."
0,"The equipment and the facility itself is beautiful. The main breaking point for me was the crowding. Be prepared to arrive at 4:30am if you like to have a little space, otherwise this place is essentially a crowded nightclub. \n\nAlso, there were a bunch of bodybuilders here who were obviously on steroids, both in behavior and in physical appearance, if that matters to you one way or the other. \n\nAlso, the membership contract is written in blood, there is no getting out. I would not recommend this gym."
4,"The day I went they had a special which they called La Passion\u00e9e, which was soft-serve two ways: creamy homemade Madagascar vanilla ice cream twisted with sweet and tangy passion fruit sorbet. Like a creamsicle taken to a whole new dimension, it was the most refreshingly delicious dessert I had all summer."
3,"Came here on a Friday night and was very pleased with the music; top 40 and hip hop.  You don't find that often here in Las Vegas.  It's always some kind of high energy, house, or trance music playing at every lounge and club you go to.  We also came on a Saturday night and they played the music I didn't like.  So this place lacks the 5th star due to inconsistency, and the fact that they don't have a small dance floor to get people to dance.  There should more dancing!\n\nI do like how they offer bottle service and hookah services as well.  Great place to hang out and chill; even better - there's a casino right outside.\n\nYelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (47/365)."
3,"Not sure why I am defending a place that is closed but once upon a time, when Ralph still owned the joint, it was a good place to eat then they sold it to Long Wong's and it went right into the dumper. Oh well I still have some fond memories of the place."
4,"I have been shopping around for salons for awhile now, never completely happy with any one I go to.  I have not gone anywhere is after trying this salon.  The star is very friendly and nice. I have not had to wait too long for service and this is the only place where I don't feel rushed. The staff actually takes their time, pampers you, and engaged you in conversation. I feel totally relaxed when i come here. They do a great job whenever I go and I never feel pressured to purchase any services I don't want. This is the only place I go now."
3,"I have only ever eaten at this location, but we have ordered from them about 10 times in the last 5 months. NEVER fails. I suggest you have 2 bottles of red wine and some great movies on hand and plan for a yummy night in.\n\nWe ordered last night and the man on the phone said that it may take about 45 minutes. He warned me of this before I ordered, and I find this respectable. I'll be damned if dude wasn't there in 42 minutes :)\n\nSesame and Orange Chicken are great. We get one of the 2 each time. Do the Egg Rolls, Spring Rolls are lame. The Chow Mien is perfect. You know how some places let the fat noddles stick together?? Not here, nope...\n\nAlso, they do not line the bottom of the containers with veggies, a deceptive trick many Asian delivery places pull.\n\nTheir bulk specials and family combos are excellent. Also, they include coupons with every delivery.\n\nWe will continue to order from here because they are reliable, consistent and very friendly."
3,"Although my boyfriend and I had standing room in the back of the ground floor, we were able to see the Bangles who rocked the house down! The acoustics were clear and I didn't need to crane my neck (even though I'm only 5'3''). Nor were my ears buzzing from the sound being too loud. So kudos galore to the set up of this theatre.\n\nThe second time I went, the lobby had turned into a place for dancing. This transformed the theatre into an entirely different yet fun atmosphere. I had the best martini of my life, as it was strawberry flavored, actually had fresh pieces of of strawberry in it, sweet, not too strong, and easy to gulp down."
0,$5 for a cup of the smallest size of chai tea latte that is a mixture of cold pre-made chai tea liquid and hot milk foam. Employees are not professional they don't even know the coffees on their menu.
3,"Stayed here 3 nights as part of a Bachelorette party. With 10 people, we were able to fit into a suite and adjoining room. While sleeping arrangements were a bit iffy at times, it was nice having a full kitchen (not that we cooked, but a fridge is necessary for alcohol) and a total of 3 full bathrooms between the 2 rooms - with 2 of the bathrooms being large masters. Lots of mirrors and outlets - again necessities for women and everyone's electronics. Super clean rooms, great housekeeping, granite counter tops in kitchen and bathroom, stainless steel everything. We had a balcony and overlooked Wet Republic/MGM pool and the airport and mountains not that far in the distance. Would have been nice to face the opposite direction to see the Strip. The lobby is very simple, compared to all the other hotels. There's a small convenience store, a small bar, and a Starbucks. They'll bag check for you if you arrive early and if you have to check out prior to heading to the airport. It should be noted this hotel is not on the Strip. Although it is connected to the MGM Grand, it's a good 15 to 20 minute walk from the inside to get to the Strip. There was always a cab available outside the lobby though, and they were able to take the side streets to get to other hotels/casinos/restaurants/bars. Had no problem getting to wherever we were going in under 10 minutes and less than $10. Although I probably won't stay here again, as I'd like to be in the middle of the Strip next time, I would recommend it for large groups. Prices are unbelievably cheap between 10 people for 2 rooms - paid $137 per person for 3 nights (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) which included all taxes, resort fees, and entry into MGM pool. Also, never waited more than a 10 seconds for an elevator."
4,"During the last years we decided not to return to this chain due to the bad experiences. Nevertheless, it can be very expensive to eat always at the Strip so we went to the new Outback near Macy's. \nLovely interior, not too cold inside.\nOur waiter was awesome : very polite and giving enough attention. \nFood came quickly and was warm enough. The new tuna was very good. My husband got the wooded grilled ribeye (njammie !) and our son the spareribs with barbecue sauce. As desert we ordered a Kahlua coffee (just piccobello !) and a cheesecake.\nWe ware happy customers this time. Keep up this level of serving meals..."
2,"One of the few places that are open late night in the area, this is the place I go to after 10 pm to grab a quick bite.  I order my usual....\n\n7 Layer Burrito\n2 - Cheesy Rice & Bean Burritos\n\nThey're pretty fast in getting your order ready.  I've never had a bad meal or service at this location.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
4,"This place is so yummy!!! But make sure you allow time, becasue everyone else likes it too and the line gets long."
2,"This place would get two stars if it wasn't for it's great location and view of the Bellagio Fountain. \n\nI was in town for a real estate seminar and my business partner, his wife, and I decided to dine here. \n\nPositives:\n1. Prices are very reasonable for being on the strip.\n2. If you're seated outside for dinner, you have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.\n3. Dimly lit and romantic setting.\n\nNegatives:\n1. My iced tea was not refilled for 20-30 minutes. The staff is seemed so busy and the service wasn't that great.\n2. My medium rare steak was very thin and overcooked. I don't get how they can cook a very thin steak medium rare...I was expecting better tasting and thicker.\n3. It's very loud inside. \n\nTips: Use Open Table and make reservations the day before or you'll wait 45+ minutes."
3,Is very good
3,"About two weeks ago, Mike from Master and Sons came out and looked at our ac unit..  As we knew it was toast from the hail storm and he confirmed it.  Mike took his time and explained the difference in the SEER rating and the difference in the makes of ac units.   When he left he said he would have an estimate to us that day.  I had the estimate within two  hours.  Totally amazing.  So we hired them to do the job, put a deposit down and made an appt for yesterday.  They showed up on time and got the job done; no fuss no muss.  Cleaned up after themselves and were polite and courteous the entire time.  Highly recommend them if you need any heating/cooling work done."
0,"VIP Taxi has to be the worst taxi service in the valley.  You call ahead to set up a reservation only to get a call at the time you were supposed to get picked up saying that they are still working on getting a cab for you.  They don't  know the meaning of the word reservation.  If you want to be disappointed, use this company."
2,"We came for Weekend brunch which was pretty good though inferior to the other ones in Vegas I've been to this year (Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, and Mozen ... yes I'm always uncomfortably full when I board the plane back home). \nTo be fair, it is also cheaper than the ones I've named at 29.99 for regular brunch Saturday and Sunday. BUT we realized the next day they had charged us the champagne brunch price of $41.99 without anyone offering us champagne!!! Grrrr\n\nThe selection is fairly standard. The highlights included their pesto mashed potatoes, and their thin pizza selection which includes a delicious pesto shrimp. The fiancee enjoyed his prime ribs a lot, but the seafood selection and quality was unimpressive. The desserts were fairly good, though I prefer the gelato stations at Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon). \nThe ambience and decor is fairly casual- the seating area makes me feel like I'm at a diner instead of in the Bellagio."
4,"We were trying to figure out a place for Sunday brunch, and I drove past Cafe Monarch on my way to Arcadia Farms once (such a disappointment) and thought it would be fun to try sometime after seeing its stellar reviews on yelp. When we were figuring out a place, I suggested we come here and it was nothing short of phenomenal. \n\nBetween the six of us we had five bottles of champagne, so we settled on the patio for a leisurely lunch. Once we were set up with a giant bucket of ice Christopher, the chef/owner/server/everything-in-one, came over and went over the menu of the day. Our choices were a cold salmon poached in jasmine tea with a cucumber salad served on a bed on red wheat salad (my choice), a baked french toast with a Merlot sauce or a strata with spinach, cheese and bacon. I had the salmon and there were two orders of french toast and three of the strata. \n\nIt took quite a while for our food to arrive, but who cares when you have good conversation, delicious wine and a beautiful patio to enjoy. (Not to mention the intoxicating aromas wafting from the kitchen.) When our food came, not only were we each awarded with our meals, but he brought us a PLATTER OF BACON. Seriously! He said it was for the french toast (we only had two orders) but there must have been close to two pounds there. \n\nOn to the food because really, that's why we came. My salmon was the perfect cool temperature (I hate it when it's ice cold) and there were two large pieces. So large that one would have been enough, but I would never complain. The cucumber salad was cut into long, julienned strips and complimented with a touch of dill. The red wheat salad was perfectly chewy and nutty (why don't more places serve grain salads?) and combined with grapes and heirloom baby tomatoes. The french toast casserole was sitting in a sweet Merlot sauce (and also maybe a vanilla sauce of some sort) and was garnished with fresh berries. The top was brown and crispy and the inside was tender, sweet and creamy. It was akin to best bread pudding you've ever had, only lighter and creamier. The strata was filled with fresh spinach and cheese and made from ciabatta. Like the french toast it was tender and creamy inside and it was hard to stop stealing bites off of my friend's plate. I would a been thrilled with any of the three breakfast selections that morning. Each was superb and two of the six of us were professional chefs and neither of them could find fault in anything. We licked our plates clean and couldn't stop talking about the food. \n\nA complimentary dessert was brought out of a platter of fresh strawberries dusted in powdered sugar and citrus zest, served with a bowl of chocolate ganache. I was the perfect light finish to our meal on a warm spring day. \n\nThis really is my new favorite restaurant. The only thing I can say is don't come here if you want a quick meal, but why would you ever want to rush something like this. Coming here is an experience, not a quick bite and I wouldn't have it any other way."
0,"Inside the Circus Circus casino. A small variety of American dishes. The chili hamburger was good and the seasoning on the shoe string fries were good as well. Mean prices were pretty average however the drinks were waaay overpriced! You can use casino credits for the food, not alcohol, so if you have comp $s than this is a good place to eat. \n\nService at the bar was terrible, so I would recommend trying to eat at the main restaurant instead of one of the side bars. \n\nChecked out the $0.25 Wings during football games. Wings aren't worth more than $0.25 each so no huge savings and one person needs more than a dozen, but taste isn't bad. \n\nSo second time around... OMG changed my mind... hamburger was not fully cooked, wings made me sick... or maybe it was the burger. Fries were chewy. Service.. just as bad as before. I'm never eating here again. (too bad because i wanted to try the desert... can you get sick from desert?)"
2,"First time at Lush Burger with my grandson - I was expecting more from the establishment after reading excellent reviews in the local papers. We were very impressed with the decor and local atmosphere - the owners clearly invested in the design of their establishment and we felt comfortable and cozy! \n\nBut the burgers were really disappointing. My grandson had to return his sliders because they had hard gristle in them. The buns were COLD - whether this was an accident or whether the chef took the decision not to heat the buns - either way, it takes away from the experience. \n\nI will definitely go back and try the burgers again - and this time ask for the buns to be heated!"
1,"If you don't have better things to do, go and enjoy it.\nIf you have been in Disney or Universal Studios this is crap."
3,"OK, it's a Subway, you know what to expect, if you want a higher end sandwich there are other higher priced options within a stones throw of this location. \n\nI'm just giving it 4 stars on those expectations. And the fact that I used to avoid this specific location, but it has improved a great deal.\n\nThe employees have consistently been nice over the last 3 visits (over a few months) \nclean location and very quick.\nEven going so far as to recommend I order another sub but have it dressed differently in order to save money on my order! Losing money on one sale, but making it up in repeat visits.\nThe bread situation as described by others seems to have improved, so they usually have the loafs that I want, which is a real perk.\nAlso the food tastes fresh, which was a problem before, perhaps they used to over prep things and store them to long? Either way, things taste better now, the price is right, and the folks are nice.\n\n\nFor decent cheap fastish food that's not designed to impress, it's a win.(I call it fastish because fast food had a drive through IMHO)\n\nThere is better to be had in the area, but not for the price, and especially if you like a lot of things on your sammy this is a great choice"
3,The fountain show at night is a must see!! It comes on once every fifteen minutes and it's quite a sight! \nWe sat across the street at mon ami gabi and had an amazing view!
4,Adam is the man\nFirst time he got it right\nHe listens and then cuts it the way you like it\n\nFive star!!!!
1,"I don't and never will claim to be a expert on Hawaiian culinary but I know food.  This place is not good!!  If you want to eat fatty beef, short ribs and chicked this is your place.  I usually give a place at least 2 tries because everyone has an off day but I won't be back a second time.  I actually lost my appetite trying to eat the bbq combo plate or should I say bbq fat plate.  Nasty!!!!  Look at what your serving your customers before it goes out of the kitchen!! We tried four sides as well, nothing memorable.  Actually, I'd like to forget about the experiece.   I gave 2 stars because at least it was a very clean restaurant.  Not my cup o' tea.  Bleck!!"
3,"There was no wait when we got there at 6:30 on a Friday night, which was great. It's a fun atmosphere. We got the dinner for 2 deal, $30 for and appetizer and two entrees. The spinach dip was delicious, and the pulled pork sandwiches were really big portions. My husband ate the whole thing, I maybe ate a third (it was a little spicy for me but I tend to like sweeter BBQ). Overall we would go back.\n\nMy hubby says for the BBQ enthusiast it would be a 4 star, for me it was probably a 3 star when I compare to other places we've spent $30 for two."
3,"I had dumplings and the Vietnamese style veggie pork skin rice noodle salad. Both were vegan. Both were tasty! The noodle salad was full of surprises. It was a nice mix of veggies, noodles and sauce."
0,"I can appreciate how difficult it must be to create a menu but this place needs to work a little harder. Went here with 9 others and only 2 of the entrees and one side was average or above. The other 7 entrees and multiple sides didn't get finished. Too many other, better places in Vegas. Don't waste your time on this, hoping you pick one of the acceptable meals. They get one star for effort, and that's being generous."
3,"Man, I used to love this place because of Haru, the mad genius sushi chef extraordinaire from Spain.. But now it's just ok.  I give it 3.25 stars"
0,"It may sound odd to you...but Rex has had many disappointments in life. Losing ones I loved. Being rejected by Starr Jones. Falling in love with a woman with no vagina. Being forced to give up my Faberge egg collection. Having 3 livers give out on me.  Losing my Elite status on Yelp. These were traumatic. Some I have never recovered from...but I am strong. I am fierce. I am not one who needs to live in the past...I move forward. Onward and mostly downward...damn law against buying organs. Oh well.\n\nI have had another bitter disappointment.  Fatburger. I want to say that my love of burgers is almost as strong as my love for the three things that mean the most to me...Emma Stone's panties I bought on Ebay, my Real Doll (minus head), and the picture of me mugging James Lipton in Central Park. So when I heard the Beastie Boys sing about Fatburger, when I heard my friends talk about FatBurger I got excited. As excited as when my Mongolian nursemaid used to change me when I was a freshman in high school.  \n\nWell, this is not a story of long lost love. This is not a story of a guilty pleasure. This is the story of tears, screaming, two ambulances and 11 cop cars.\n\nI will first start by saying that Rex does well in life. He wants for very little. So after I got done my panhandling shift on The Strip I decided to take my limousine...some call it a bus...to a Fatburger far away from that god forsaken place of broken dreams, Chlamydia, and overpriced drinks.  This is not my first Fatburger experience...but three hours of gas fumes, and a trip after 2 weeks in county lockup is not a good way to prepare for an eating experience.  \n\nThe first thing that happens to Fatburger is sticker shock...it is so damn expensive I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. I thought that years of sucking on bottles of a watered down bleach/ammonia mixture I call \""Blind Happiness\"" had finally done permanent damage. The prices are outrageous for any \""fast food\"" burger joint.  They charge 50 cents for CHEESE...REGULAR CHEESE!!!  How the hell can anyone justify asking 50 cents for cheese on a 9 dollar burger?  They have some gall. I haven't seen that kind of gall since the time I watched a guy take someone's kidneys while he was sleeping. It was amazing what you can do with two sleeping pills and a hacksaw.\n\nRex can live with high prices...IF...IF things are good. Here is the best part. The burgers suck. They are dry. They are over cooked. The cheese is bland. The toppings are flavorless. They need a special sauce or something to make their burgers worth ten bucks.  Two of us ate burgers, fries and drinks...for 25 bucks!! 25 bucks!! Here is what is the biggest crime...Burger King is better. Mcdonalds is better. Wendy's is better. Forget the really good places like In and Out or Smashburger...oh they are off the charts better. This is just a dry burger on a pedestrian roll with bland toppings.  Fatburger is living off  a name. Here is a name I have...RipOffBurger. This is awful. There is absolutely nothing special about this no matter how hard you try to find something...like Amanda Peet.\n\nThe shakes are bad and overpriced, the onion rings taste like they have been frozen previously, the fries were soggy and not crispy. There wasn't one good thing on the menu, and I say that with no exaggeration. EVEN THE SODA WAS WATERED DOWN TASTING! The mixture of the soda machine is desperately off. \n\nTo add insult to our already crappy experience.  When I stood on the table, screamed that these robber barons should at least use a gun of they were going to rip us off...I was the one that the cops led out in handcuffs and leg shackles.  It is truly a world gone mad.  I think it was when I jumped over the counter and shoved their flavorless meat patties in the cooks mouth and screamed \""now you know how your mom feels when I go to your house.\""  The truth hurts too badly I guess.\n\nRex fights for you even though he hates you."
4,"Las Vegas Jewelry and Coin Buyers helped me get a diamond for my engagement ring. They were awesome from beginning to end. I live in Chicago, but had a relationship with the sister store in Westmont, IL. When it came time to purchase an engagement ring, I knew who to call. They worked tirelessly to make our big day a success. We show off the ring every chance we get. I highly recommend Las Vegas Jewelry and Coin."
0,"My husband and I are doing a complete remodel of our property in Scottsdale. Hired Good Guys Electric to completely rewire the property and in the beginning I was very happy with Mike and the work he did. Of course with every job there were a few things that went wrong but they could be corrected. Everything was inspected and passed. Now we are at the stage on this job to have it completed and here is were the problem started. I have since the beginning of October been trying to contact Mike via voice mail, text message and finally had to give him a deadline to answer back. Nothing on his side so I sent an e-mail to the address that I had on record and canceled the contract with him. I do not know what is going on and can only hope that he is able to get back on track but at this time because of all the extra work that this is causing me since I now need to find someone who will be willing to take on a half completed job, I must write this comment so that no one else will be taken by surprise. Always remember to contact the Register of Contractors at rocaz.gov to check on the current status of the business license for any contractor that is working in Arizona."
2,I think the forum shops at Caesars are better.
4,"City of Grace is an awesome place to come and hear the Word of God.  Pastors Terry and Judith are genuine and sincere with so much love for the people of Arizona and they have such a great passion to reach out and share the Word of God.  Scottsdale, Mesa and Downtown church campuses are all so welcoming and encouraging the communities to come and fellowship and hear the Word of God and grow together."
2,"Guilty pleasure-their churros.\n\nIt has like a cinammon cream inside. Nothing like biting on a warm churro...thing though it has a tendency to squirt out the cream! Just a warning. I got it on a light colored shirt and stained it. \n\nNow the big complaint is that if you do late night drive thru- check your bags before driving away. \n\nWe've gone only a few times and they forgot things 3 times maybe out of 5 visits....and somehow it's always what the BF ordered since he orders a few smaller things and I just usually want just a salad and churros.\n\nAlso don't assume they put the proper sauces in your bag- he got a appetizer trio and didnt get marinara, ranch or sweet and sour. \n\nNothing makes me more irritated than going home and things are missing that you paid for and now theres not enough food. So don't do it to yourself...check it because they're not paying attention at this location.\n\nI should add that they just opened, so hopefully it's just a learning curve and not the usual disposition of the staff here."

0,"No star is my rating, but I have to select something. I was there with a groom and his groom's men, we fell for the $30 a person deal with a free limo ride to the club and back to our hotel plus 2 free drinks.\nWhen we arrived they tried to sell us on a $500 dollar shampane. Took about 5 minutes for them to understand we weren't interested. \nAfter paying our 30 per person fee. We got swarmed by girls, which 80% of them looked to be in their 40s and not in the good looking way.\nOnce we got seated we paid for a 30 minute \""VIP\"" lap dance for the groom for $140. The girl took him back and we waited, while we waited the waitress got us our first round of \""free\"" drinks. Which then she pushed us into giving her a tip for the drinks. She ended up getting about $20 dollars in tips for our first round.\nMost of us didn't even ask for a second round.\nWhile we still waited a girl started dancing up on one of the grooms men, no price or agreement was ever exchanged. After 20 minutes she stop and told him the price was $240. Because he didn't have that much money on him plus the girl wasn't worth that much. He only had 15 dollars on him which she didn't take and demanded that he ask some of the other guys in the group for money. He ended up giving her $45.\nWe all started to feel uneasy and uncomfortable so decided that we would leave after the groom came back.\nAfter 2 hours we got suspecious of where he was because we only paid for 30 minutes. The VIP room wasn't easily accesses so we asked one of the security to let us in. He said one of us can go in, but when he entered he was told by someone else that he couldn't be in there without a girl. The grooms men that entered tried to explain that he was just trying to get the groom and leave because we didn't pay for this much time. The bouncer said the groom must of paid for more time.\nAfter 3 hours we demanded for the groom to leave but instead were shown the door. One grooms men slipped passed security and into the VIP room and pulled the groom out. They were stopped and told that the fees needed to be paid before they could leave. They tried to explain we already paid, and the groom was being told by the stripper \""he had more time.\"" They changed the groom 700 dollars for a dance that he didn't want.\nOnce we got everyone outside we tried to get our ride back to the hotel, but because we caused so much \""problems\"" the bouncer/security told us to leave the property. So we had to find a cab on the strip to get back to our hotel.\nI hope no one else gets screwed over like this!"
3,"Cute little place. Only tried some of the baked goods, and they were good. I hope to try their desserts and coffee next time."
1,Was at this campus for a LinkedIn event. It was adequate. Building is dated and has that feel. Computer lab was fine but somewhat confining.  The event itself was great though!
0,"I am so displeased at this business that I have gone so far as to report them to the BBB. I highly recommend not going here, EVER. If you care to read the entire story it's below. Long story short: I received my $45 altered dress with a missing tie that went around the waist. They claimed I never dropped it off with the tie, and yelled after several times even after asking him to lower his voice, please stop yelling at me and to calm down They also hung up on me over the phone and never offered to replace the tie or refund my money after returning to the business for a resolution.\n\n\nLong Story: \nI dropped off two dresses to be altered on 7/12/14.  When explaining how I wanted one green dress to look, I used the waist tie to lift up and over the excess fabric I wanted to be removed to demonstrate exactly how I wanted the dress to look. I returned to pick up my dresses on 7/23/14. I paid and then asked if it would be okay to try my dress on. I stepped out of the dressing room in the green dress and asked where the tie was to my dress. The woman who works there instantly said \""No tie\"". I explained that yes, I did drop the tie off with the dress and now it has gone missing. The woman kept saying \""no tie, no tie\"" and stated I dropped it off without the tie. The man claimed I never dropped it off with the tie either and told me to go home and look for it because they don't have it. I left upset and went home to look. Of course, I didn't find it anywhere and decided to call. Again they said they didn't get the tie when I dropped the dress off and hung up on me over the phone. I called back twice before he answered and he started to yell at me stating that he has a system and the tie was never on the dress. He also said, \""you keep saying the tie is missing, but I have the same answer.\""  I ended the phone call with, \""I will be back in tomorrow.\"" I went back to the business on 7/26/14 and nicely explained that I had looked everywhere and not found the tie. I also tried to explain to him that I remember using the tie as a way to show how I wanted the alterations completed and that I understand mistakes happen. I said, \""this is an easy mistake and I understand. I just want you to make it right. I dropped my dress off, paid $45 for an alteration and received my dress with missing parts. I am upset at the service I received.\"" The man raised his voice and was yelling at me at how he has so many clothes and a system to how he does his work. He again claimed that I never brought the tie in with the dress. I asked him multiple times to not yell at me and to lower his voice and to calm down because I was only looking for a solution to my poor service. After about 5-10 minutes of this, I told them I would have to report them to the BBB for the poor service, respect and product that I received. He told me \""fine, do whatever you want.\"" And I left."
2,"This is a good news/bad news review. I have been here twice before reviewing.\nGood news: food is awesome-hence the 3 stars. I can be very picky about too much salt or heavy spicing, or drowning perfectly wonderful food in sauce until all you can taste is the sauce...and that ain't gonna happen here unless *I* screw it up!\nAs an uber-control freak, I absolutely loved being able to fine-tune my food to my particular tastes. Lots of good protein choices, tons of vegetables and some interesting spice and sauce choices (including none at all!). This absolutely screams for anyone who has allergies, strong likes and dislikes, people on diets of any kind, adventurous souls and parents of kids in the\""I don't like that\"" stage.\n\nAnd now for the bad news. The service is, at best, uneven. First visit: wonderful, attentive service, *but* I knew one of the floor managers on duty, and perhaps the staff was aware of that? Second visit: In NYC vernacular, \""fuggetaboutit\"". Greeted by hostess with \""Only one?\"" Hello, do you think making a customer feel somehow inadequate at the get-go is a good start? Explained nicely the error of making me feel like I have a capital letter L on my forehead... and we move on.\n Hostess references the great new apps, and suggests the edamame. I'm game, and am leaning towards it...  Server shows up quickly, takes a beer order after I ask her to give me 5 to decide, and then launches right into dinner even though I am HOLDING the apps menu. Sooo.... never asks about appetizer. Sale lost. Hey, I'm not doing her job- she is. Dinner good, served fast. Server drops check in front of me as my fork hits the bottom of the bowl.\n In a rush to go home, sweetie? Because, I am *not* done yet. Told her, still hungry since you *never asked* me about the edamame your hostess set me up for (BTW, good job, hostess!!), so let's have the Asian Ice Cream; oh, not in stock? vanilla? sure, ok, whatever? No, no chocolate sauce, thanks. I left my inner 3 year old home tonight with the sitter. \n\nI really, really hate to be rushed at a restaurant. I deliberately chose a Tuesday night so it wouldn't be so busy that there would be pressure to turn the table over quickly. I drove over an hour to get there, I'd like to enjoy my meal. \nI will mention that the floor manager served my dessert, probably because it was obvious that I was annoyed.\nSo here's the recap. Food, 4 stars. Service, 2. Average: 3. May or may not give this a third attempt, but at an hour-plus drive, I have many other options."
1,"If ur not into beef or pork, then u probably shouldn't eat here because mostly all there soups are beef/pork based (even their chicken pho). They give u a tomato based option, but it just ruins the whole pho experience! I did not want tomato soup! \nAlso, our kids got a chicken tender meal which was suppose to come with soda, that they didn't get til after they ate because the waiter forgot. Ended up taking the can drinks home. The waiters r friendly, just forgetful.\nSo, guess we'll be eating at any other pho place, because this is the only one that didn't have chicken based soups, or veggie based soups."
0,"Not the greatest choice,people upset while waiting 4 their order.after it took 15 minutes 4 someone 2 come 2 the front as the phone constantly ringing. As know one bothered 2 answer it @ all! I don't give this a star @ all. Go somewhere else."
0,"The plumber came out to install a water softener. He charged me $59 for a quote and price was nearly $500. He spent at most 10 minutes looking around, nothing was itemized on his quote and he was surly. I had used Lange for an earlier project thinking they had good service but no way...THEY WERE AWFUL. I gave all the details about my unit to the plumber but either they didn't write it down or didn't care. I also wanted a quote on them installing an under-mount sink in the kitchen only to have them tell me (ONCE THEY ARRIVED), that they don't install under-mount sinks. When you find a good service provider in Vegas you stick with them...LANGE PLUMBING is NOT a good service provider. When I called their office, the response I got was...\""Sorry\"". I may as well have taken $59 and burned it in the back yard. I got ZERO value! Lange Plumbing apparently makes it's money by ripping people off for $59 fees. I will never use them again and I will try to convince as many people as possible to never use their service."

Vous allez dire que l'on ne va pas aux cin\u00e9mas pour ces raisons mais que voulez vous, les salles comme l'Imp\u00e9rial me manque. D'accord, c'est bien situ\u00e9, oui pour les m\u00e9gahits, les technologies sont \u00e0 jours mais il me manque le '' je ne sais quoi '' des cin\u00e9mas plus petits et selon moi plus charmant. \nCes commentaires ne s'applique pas qu'au Banque Scotia, j'en conviens, mais il est l'\u00e9piphanie de cette pas si nouvelle tendance \u00e0 faire des cin\u00e9mas de grands cirques bruyants. J'y retournerais, c'est s\u00fbre, mais un petit peu \u00e0 reculons \u00e0 chaque fois. \n\nBon, je mets mon dentiers dans mon verre d'eau et je me prends un ''paparmane'' rose... et j'\u00e9coute un vieux film \u00e0 la maison!"
0,she never showed up for the appointment... I called a couple of times. I even bought a Yelp deal and never got to use it... Booo
0,I bought a groupon for my auto detail.   The website states that the detail includes (I have copied and pasted from their website): \nExterior Wash\nExterior/Interior Window Cleaning\nApply protective wax\nInterior vacuum\nWipe dash/console/cup holder areas\nShampoo Carpet\nShampoo/Clean Seats\nTires & Wheels Shined\n\nMy seats were NOT cleaned/shampooed.  Cupholders were NOT wiped clean.  Doorjambs were NOT cleaned.  I wanted my van detailed specifically to clean the seats and doorjambs.  I'm very disappointed in this service and strongly advise everyone to stay away from this company.
4,The shumai and bbq ribs! And beef and broccoli! Even some of the sushi was decent. And they had real ice cream! Teriyaki chicken! And chicken wings! And chicken on a stick! And potstickers with the perfect sauce! This is where I'll come from now on when I want to eat greasy Chinese until my stomach hurts.
4,"Love this adorable spot.  The marketplace is fantastic as an early morning for coffee and AMAZING pastry after a crisp morning walk.\n\nThe cafe for brunch or lunch is so quaint, it was just lovely!  Atmosphere is just completely adorable.\n\nFood amazing.  I had the mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. Absolutely perfect. My group also recommends quesadilla omelette and the crapes with ham and cheese with b\u00e9chamel sauce.\n\nService was friendly, quick and professional."
3,"I had a ticket to see Cirque du Soleil's O this evening, which is at the Bellagio. \n\nI had supper at Fix Restaurant & Bar, which is also in the Bellagio.\n\nI was seated in the front near the open area.  It was great for people watching but since it's close to the slot machines and people are allowed to smoke in the casino, I could smell cigarettes and cigars :(\n\nI wasn't overly hungry so ordered wings.  There were 13 in my order (they were all drummettes) and they were excellent!  The sauce had just the right amount of heat and they were really tender and juicy.  I'd get them again. \n\nMy servers were very attentive and friendly and I was well taken care of."
3,Breakfast guilty pleasure :)
2,"Had a group dinner here with around 12 folks and overall it was a decent meal.  The spot has good ambiance and the help was great.  The food was well done in some aspects but others failed miserably.  Hot and sour soup was poor, fried rice was not flavorful, lamb dish was pretty decent and the kung pao chicken was pretty good.  It's pricey so it's challenging to give it a 4 star rating for the food quality but overall if you're at Mandalay and want a nice sit down Chinese meal it's worth a shot for sure."
0,"The amenities and valet parking are nice and this could have been a 5 star experience but it was not.\n\nEntered my suite and it wasn't properly cleaned, trash was under the bed and empty beer cans were in the kitchenette drawers and an empty beer box was in the cupboard under the ice bucket.\n\nPhone in the bathroom was cracked open.\n\nThe sink faucet was broken.\n\nCalled for maid service Friday and items were missing from my room afterwards.\n\nWhen you call the front desk you'll be put on hold for a few minutes before someone answers, then they transfer you to someone else and you'll be put on hold for even longer before you speak to someone.. Every single time."
3,"The shrimp balls are the bees knees!! I wish they had more places like this in LA, we got served really fast and the staff was friendly, LOVE the Jasmin tea, a little pricey but we only come here once every time we visit the city, and will keep on doing so."
3,"The menu changed during 2013, and I preferred the previous menu to the new.  The new mock chicken is still the best around, but it's not as good as the previous. \n\nThe food here is awesome! Vegetarian or not, everyone loves this place. The food is creative, delicious and made from fresh ingredients.  The mock meats are so good and so well prepared that you will forget it's mock. I LOVE the wings, especially the new jalape\u00f1o flavor and the \""original g\"" or \""wendy's pickle\"" are great choices, but so is everything else on the menu. \nA tsoynami for dessert is a must, they have a long list of options, check them out, you will be in love. \n\nYou go up to the cashiers and grab a menu, take a seat and decide on your meal, then return the cashier to place your order. They will give you a number and bring out your meal, but there is no waiter service. \n\nThe ambiance is trendy, and laid back, very casual and welcoming."
3,"Fopp in Rose Street is the place to go in Edinburgh for any music or movie lover! After the closure of the Fopp branch in Cockburn Street, this branch has, since then, been my number one place to spend large amounts of time staring at CD's which cost as little as \u00a33!\n\nWith the impact of online music sales and file sharing, record shops have declined in recent years but it is good to see that Fopp is always buzzing with indie teenagers or movie anoraks! I always like to buy CD's or DVD's from an actual record shop as I prefer to actually have a CD case and cover in my hand! \n\nFopp, to me, is the indie alternative to HMV, even though they sell the same products (HMV actually owns Fopp also)! I love spending hours in there buying foreign films for a fiver, or getting some obscure Nick Cave album for \u00a33! \n\nI guarantee you will find a bargain in Fopp, so go on blissfully wonder about this shop for hours and enjoy yourself!"
2,"Risked my life for some BBQ last night...and my groupon was about to expire :p. Got out of my car and I could smell the smoker outside working some magic.  It took about 10 min before my order was taken, since disorganization seems to be going inside....i know some of the other reviews state the ladies working here are mean, but I thought they seemed nice and polite. This place is in a slightly shady part of town...evidenced by the guy in front of me asking for his order as quick as possible since he was on house arrest and couldn't be out for too long :(  I ordered the pork ribs...and I wouldn't order it again....dry and tough.  However the bright shining star of this BBQ pit is the beef brisket.  The most tender brisket I've ever had and smothered in a tangy, sweet BBQ sauce that has a kick at the end.  I would dare say I will risk my life and come down here again just for the brisket...well maybe during daylight hours next time."
2,"Mixed review with the family my son and wife ordered ramen. They said the that Monta was better ... I tried the ramen wasn't bad ... My daughter ordered Salmon steak and shrimp tempura bowl. That was really good. I only ordered sushi and i enjoyed it as well, every thing was fresh and service was crazy ... very bzy...we waited 30 minutes. They do take reservation and will do that next time. I did take a 1 photo of the sushi i ordered was really good. I will post it today. Please give this place a chance but i would order sea food here not the ramen."
2,"McCarran Airport is just a-ok.\n\nThe location is at the end of the Vegas strip so if you are staying on or near the strip it isn't too bad of a cab ride.  That is, unless you get a shady cab driver who takes you out to the highway and back on the strip which puts more $$ in their pockets.  Unless something is going on that is unusual there is no need why your cab driver cannot take you from the airport directly on to the strip so FYI.  Exceptions would be if you are staying on the end of the strip near the Wynn.  The best advice is to evaluate which casino you are at in relation to which end of the strip so you can avoid your cab driver taking the highway route.  \n\nGetting from the airport to your destination via cab is usually a sort of nightmare (especially in the warm months) as the cab lines are looooooooooooong.  Be prepared to wait.\n\nOf course most people are tickled that this airport has over 1200 slot machines including at the terminals so you can gamble up until the last minute before getting on your plane.  \n\nBaggage claim takes FOREVER at McCarran since most people who come through this airport carry a lot of bags.  Baggage claim is also massive with tons of turnstiles so be aware."
0,"Do not be fooled by the full parking lot!!  If it was great the lengthy line would be worth it.. The BBQ sauce had no taste and we had the brisket and pulled pork and after a few bites we swore we would never come back!  Highly disappointed cuz there are not a lot of BBQ places in the area so we were so excited... Oh well, we will just keep hoping for a new place to open.."
1,"I guess you can call me a pho snob because I was spoiled by my mother who spends hours on the soup. I decided to come here because I was craving pho and I figured it'd be perfect for dinner. We waited in this long ridiculous line and there were tons of open seats, but no one to seat any of us so I think that's what the line was all about. Once we got pass the gates of your greatness, it took forever for the waiter to even come by and get our drinks orders. I ended up ordering my drinks with my meal in one sitting since I wasn't sure when he'll be back. \n\nThe pho arrived and it was very bland, very watery and almost like they just put a cup of hot water over the noodles. The price for the pho alone was not cheap either! So I felt like I wasted my time waiting in line, I wasted my appetite, and I wasted my money here."
1,"I cant really say that I would recommend seeing a performance at Ovens Auditorium. Compared to the belk theatre and some of the other theatre around town it really doesnt compare. You can really expect a high school auditorium feel at Ovens. The seats are old, not very comforable seats and when we went it was super hot inside. WIth that many people in one building they really need to get better ventilation and air conditioning. I have a very bad back and I can not go to many places because of the discomfort with the seating and this is one of those places I could not go back to. Ovens has had a lack of big performances within the last couple of years, and the prices were about the same as Belk theatre so it doesnt make any sense to go to Ovens."

3,"Love me some green belt action!  There's not much to say that hasn't been said already, except for this (and listen carefully):\n\nDo not expect a fun ride a day or so after a storm.  Right around the Indian School underpass it floods a lot, and fish tend to die right near the concrete, so it is super SMELLLLLLLLLLY.  Not the best when you're working out and taking deep breaths!\n\nOtherwise remarkably clean and well kept.  Thanks City of Scottsdale!"

Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \""Whooparons\"" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin."
1,"There are several things anyone has a right to expect when encountering one of the plethora of Emeril's restaurants, and a few additional ones that pertain exclusively to the \""NOFH.\"" So allow me to recount my recent visit in these terms:\n\n1. Ambience - a five! This is my first visit since they've redone the place, and it soars above the previous incarnation.\n\n2. Service -- a five! It was impeccable. Every person we encountered did their job perfectly.\n\n3. Price -- a four. Ok...it's the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, so you have to expect to pay. The wine list, however, did seem a bit bloated with more one, two and three \""C-note\"" bottles than necessary. I had to seak out the lowly $40 Chardonnay befitting my modest budget. The entrees also called for a %-age or two  more pain than might seem necessary.\n\n4. The drinks -- a three. A Hendricks martini with olives -- excellent....but why the additional price? It was good, but no better...and not any larger than the same elsewhere.\n\n5. The entree -- a four. The sea bass special was very good...not any better, however, than many other more moderately priced SB elsewhere.\n\n6. The dessert -- A ZERO. Bread pudding......?!?! Huh??? It was a load of warm, whiskey-hinted [not soaked] cream sauce with a few \""turdlettes\"" of bread pudding bobbing to the surface now and then. I must admit, in candor, that I like my BP on the dry side, but even so....this was a tasteless exercise in disappointment. [For those of you who wander in and out of Claremont, CA -- try The Press's version. And you \""Emeril\"" people might give it a try too!]\n\n7. The \""hot starter\"": MINUS FIVE. Let me spell out what I ordered....so you can \""drink in\"" the irony -- M-A-R-Y-L-A-N-D B-L-U-E C-R-A-B C-A-K-E.   This is a \""New Orleans\"" restaurant, right?? And isn't blue crab a *specialty*? Well, I was EXPECTING an excellent version of the justly famous MBCC! What I got was something that your local Denny's might THROW AWAY as inferior!! Sure there were *some* flakes of Blue Crab in it....barely discernable from the breading! AND it was coated.....heavily coated with STUFF -- then deep fried!!!! Oh Emeril, Emeril, Emiril....whither goest thou?!?! I'm a devotee of *both* \""Live\"" and \""Essence,\"" and I know I've seen E himself prepare REAL MBCC's. I expected no less at his NOFH....but received far far far less!! [Just give me a pound or two of fresh lump and a can of Old Bay, and I WILL SHOW YOUR COOKS WHAT TO DO WITH IT.] Maybe the $8 per CC should have tipped me off....instead it just ticked me off!\n\nI'm from Baltimore and I know crab cakes....but these, Mr. Celebrity Chef, were no crab cakes."
2,"I went here tonight with my co-workers for our holiday meal and there was 9 of us.\n\nThe setup is pretty simple - you have 4 stages of your meal which are salad bar, meat, dessert, and checkout. These states are dictated by your table by a round peg with different colors on it.\n\nBeing with 9 dudes we all decided that we were there to eat meat and more meat so we immediately turned the peg to green (for meat). This must have thrown off the staff because we all sat there for 10minutes twiddling our thumbs waiting for the meat skewers to come out.\n\nI think they wanted us to go get salad... because filling up on salad and a little meat is FAR less expensive than eating 5 pounds of meat per dude.\n\nFinally they caught on and started bringing meat out. We kept them busy but still they were slow. I am generally a slow eater and I could pretty much gobble up my meat before they even got around the table. Then... you'd have to wait 2-3 minutse for the next skewer to come out. So everyone spent a lot of time staring at an empty plate.\n\nThis isn't bad if you want to chat, which we did, but at the same time we were there to eat. As time goes on, food settles and you get full... so again, we were there for business and wanted more before it settled.\n\nWith that said, most of us went home stuffed. One guy could have stayed for another 4 hours, especially at the pace they were going at.\n\nThis was the first time I went to a Brazilian Steakhouse so I can't compare. A few of the other guys had gone elsewhere before and I believe they said that other places were better. I thought the food was decent but nothing I was absolutey dying for nor writing home about. I think everyone else felt the same."
2,"Good, cheap Thai food. I'm a sucker for what is probably inauthentic peanut sauce, and their \""peanut sauce lover\"" was a frequent indulgence. The red and green curry is also awesome. Don't miss their red chili sauce to add some real heat to your dishes - it's always very very hot.\n\nIf they delivered...I would have lived on this stuff in college."
3,"I didn't know food at one Pita Jungle could differ from another.  I swore I would never return to this location after I witnessed an employee do something gross (sneezed in her palm, handled money, and then bare handed my pita), which I notified a manager of and it was rectified.  Fast forward a couple of years.  I return.  Wow.  The tofu at this location is fantastic.  The Macro platter here is worth the drive from where I am and I would drive past 2 other Pita Jungles.  Big fan.  The server was really nice.  I was at 0 stars when I walked in and became 4 stars when I left."
1,"The Bow Bar is fine but... I don't know, have I been here on off nights?\n\nI've been here twice in the past couple of weeks and both times I've walked in and gone \""ooh... right...\"" have had one, and have moved on.  \n\nThe first thing you notice is the pungeant smell of the toilets.  You know that smell of cleaning fluid that doesn't quite cover the smell of a dirty toilet?  That one.  \n\nThe second thing you notice is the distinct lack of places to sit, and the third (probably related to the first two) is the distinct lack of women.\n\nThe bartenders I've experienced have been on the cool (as in unfriendly) side of neutral, to the extent of one actually being rude to my parents as they were trying to find a place to stand and happened to get in his way as he headed back behind the bar.  And no, he was not carrying any glasses.\n\nThey have a good selection of beers, they're famous for their whiskys, and they have some interesting and hard to find spirits but... to me it's not really worth another trip.  I've tried hard to like it, coming here a few times and giving it the benefit of the doubt but ... meh, I've definitely experienced better."
0,I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
2,"This place has an all you can eat buffet, for only 8.75. Basiclally you get what you pay for. The sushi was by for not the best of charlotte, however it wasnt bad either. If your strapped for cash it's worth eating here. Servers are nice. Atmosphere is nice also. We have been back numerous times."
3,The room is pretty nice and clean - can't find anything wrong with it. Love the architecture as well.
0,"I used to live in Las Vegas and took my very expensive shoe collection for regular repair and maintenance to Shoe Lab.The repairs were always expensive but seemed to be decent. There is one pair of Christian Louboutin boots that originally retailed for more than $1,400. The heel broke so I took them to shoe lab. They \""fixed\"" the issue by putting in a new heel and recovering it. For some reason, they never quite seemed right - it almost was if they replaced with a shorter heel. Not long after, the other heel broke. I have since moved away from Las Vegas and found a very good cobbler at which to have the boots repaired. Upon repairing my heels the correct way (meaning ordering the appropriate heels from the manufacturer), he discovered that the old heel repaired by shoe lab was simply super-glued in place and re-covered with a cheap imitation leather fabric. He said this was not only dangerous, but a rip-off, as they had charged me $250. I am disgusted and now going back through the other shoes I had reheeled by Shoe Lab in order to check for this same issue. Take my advice and DO NOT take your shoes to Shoe Lab."
2,"Personally this is not for me but I am giving it three stars because I realize I was able to ride this for Free due to the Veterans day special they were offering to give Active Duty / Veterans free Ticket for them plus a guest which is such a awesome deal.  If I had paid full price for my ticket I imagine I would of left with a worse taste in my mouth because this thing is honestly very slow and not nearly as intimate as I had imagined. The pods are roomy because they don't JAM it packed with people but it includes very little space to sit and our pod had a little toddler that ended up dumping my purse everywhere when my friend was taking our photo. The view is truly amazing and I think if you're going to pony up the $ it is worth doing the ride that is at night. If I had to ever ride this again though I would definitely go with the VIP ride that includes open bar because at least I would feel like I was doing something. I am more of a fast paced personality and I don't really \""relax\"" and take in the view all that well especially with their TV monitors blaring that annoying guys voice with fun trivia facts. Overall everyone that worked that evening was super friendly and I did end up buying the photo at the end because it was a pretty good special they were running for three photos it was $35 plus the frame . Since my ticket was free I figured why not? especially since I don't plan on rushing back to the wheel anytime soon."
4,"\""How long will these keep?\""\n\""I suppose a few weeks since all the moisture is gone, but we've never had any last that long.\""\nSold.\n\nThese biscotti are outstanding. Lemon and cinnamon are our house favorites. Entering my humble abode with my bi-weekly, two bag order from Enrico's biscotti, you would think I was returning from a multi-year military campaign, ushered in with a hero's welcome, celebrated as though I conquered ISIS, North Korea, and Nickleback all in one battle. \n\nBut seriously, this biscotti is the real deal. Saddle up with some strong coffee (or splurge on some whole milk if you're my kid), and enjoy.\n\nOh yeah, the coconut macaroons are the jam, too. Those don't make it home. Mama has got to do Mama sometimes."
1,"I wanted to like this place. The girls are more \""North Las Vegas\"" looking than \""Vegas\"" looking, But that's not the problem I had with this place. Minus one star.  \nSecondly, the the music sucked. Bad. The dj talks thru the songs and it seems the girls couldn't get a good full dance without all the dj interruptions. That's why I took off another star.\nMain reason I gave this place only two stars...\nWe came in at sat at the bar. Ordered a house whiskey and diet for my friend(mesured shot) and a draft 12oz. Dos XX for myself. $16. Eh. It's a strip club. It's Vegas. But come on now. :/\nSo we sat there drinking our drinks and the bartender kept hounding us if we want another round. We were only a few sips in. Every 3 to 5 minutes asking us if we're ready for another round. Mind you, we were the only people sitting at the bar, cause all the couches were full of patrons. I can see why now no one was sitting at the bar. After watching the action for about fifteen minutes or so the bartender took my beer, which was about gone, maybe 1/4 left. And poured it out and the asked me if I wanted another one. I then told him that I wasn't finished with the one he took. And with a big attitude, poured a shot of bud light back in my same glass and plopped it down inf ront of me. What a douche bag. \nMy friend, she was drinking her drinks. I was driving. I just wanted the one beer. It's not like we were taking up space at the bar. \nSince the friend I was with was way prettier then the dancers, they didn't hound us for lap dances. But I was putting tips in the G Strings. We were spending money. \nMind you, this place is opposite of high end. It's a Mexican strip club. Matter of fact, I've been to better strip clubs in Mexico. I don't blame the girls on this one. It was the crappy employees and the dj set. I wasn't expecting much, from this lil shack in the bad part of town but someone needs to explain to the management about \""YELP\"" and the customers who post on it. \nWould I go back? I'll give it another shot. I'll just drink first before I go. Oh and they frisk you when you come in, which gave me a false sense of security."
3,"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I had crispy, greasy, packed with meat tacos just like I like `em.  The beans and rice were great and the chips are the thinnest, most crispy delights I've had in a long time!\nThe staff was super nice too.\nThis place is super casual and good."
3,"The Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin is nothing less than an institution in Paris, so I was pretty blown away when finding they were branching out in Montreal. The museum specializes in wax statues of important figures and celebrities. As happy as I was to go, the prices were hard to swallow: 16$ with student discount?! \nOnce inside you wait to witness the \""Palace of seasons\"", a magical 3D projection mimicking a journey through the year. As beautiful as this was, looking back on it, I'm not sure why it is part of the visit, my guess is that it keeps the flow of visitors in check. You then move freely among the wax people, whom(which?) you can freely grope and snap pics with. The rooms are themed (more or less), a big favourite being the \""Sports room\"" with Wayne Gretzky, Crosby and Terry Fox among others. \n\nWhat's fun is looking if whether or not the statue does your favourite actor/singer/politician justice, as well as getting lost in the decors (epic decors!). Another fun thing is testing your general culture against that of other museum goers (apparently nobody cares/knows who Andy Warhol or Jimmy Hendrix are, but then again, my history is rusty and I couldn't identify this general or that nun, or even some Hockey great, so...). A real cool part of the exhibit let's you get your face scanned and dress/style your eventual wax figure! Fun and slightly creepy, prepare to wait in line! The only true complaint I have relates to the historical room, where you get to embark on a journey to New France with Jacques Cartier, Montcalm, Wolfe and other founding figures. Our forefathers are surrounded by a couple of First nations people. They don't have names, they don't even have a tribe. Is this an Innu? Why is she hanging around S. Champlain if she lives thousands of miles up north? Is this an Iroquois, or a Miqmak family? Nope, just random Indians, ya know? Who knows if the costumes are accurate? The only First Nations people credited are the ones who collaborated with the settlers (a Chief, no tribe) or took on the settler's culture (the first Aborigenal Saint). I briefly studied Museum Curating, and I have to admit, I have a beef with that.\n\nPsst, Hey Girl, you can cuddle with Ryan Gosling.."
0,This place is now CLOSED AND GONE!  I'm sad because i actually liked this place
3,"I really liked this place.  It felt like we were in Eastern Europe.  The only thing missing was a hint of Drakkar Noir in the air.\n\nWe had the following items:\n---  Cheese plate:  Four cheeses paired with pureed fruit and nuts.  \n---  Mixed olive plate - just OK, got to be a bit much\n---  Chorizo con vino - this was my favorite\n---  Vareniki - dumplings - also very good\n\nThe service was quite good and I really loved the atmosphere.  There are a lot more items on the menu I'd like to try.\n\nGive Forte a try if you want to have a unique (for Las Vegas) dining experience."

There is an ice cream stand too. \n\nThe gift store has things you will find nowhere else. It is the holiday season and it is beautifully decorated for Christmas with trees everywhere.

4,"Ahh what can I say about Vaquero's?  Hard to locate, but magnificent. Just to the East of the awesome King Tut's Cafe, it is the number one late night drunken Mexican food place in Tempe. Get the three rolled tacos with cheese.\n\nI recouped many times in the parking lot. Nice people and awesome food. It will make you shit though. Possibly in your pants."
3,"Stopped in for a coffee and they were cool enough to let us in despite closing for lunch. Tasty coffee, great spot facing the water. Would go there for a bite next time I'm in town."
4,"Completed our 3rd trip here within 4 months. This trip included their awesome Veggie Fries with the addition of the Cajun Wings. As other people have stated VERY good wings.\n  This recent trip I decided to try the house special \""Sweet Meat\"" Burger... Wow!   What a unique and tasty flavor combination. The glazed donut type bun and sweet onion mayo along with Angus burger and smokey bacon?!?!  Happiness!!  Great beers and our waiter was terrific as always! We love this place!!"
1,"Went to Barrio Queen for lunch today.  I live in Chandler and was meeting a friend from Cave Creek so we wanted to meet somewhere in the middle.  I got a lot of recommendations to try this place and read the reviews on Yelp.  It sounded great!  Parking was easy... it was a Saturday afternoon but the underground garage had plenty of spaces and it's free.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to sit outside.  It is unseasonably warm right now and unfortunately our table had a lot of sun so it was kind of hot!  But, it was a nice patio and I liked the overall feel of the place.  Our server took our drink order and I think she brought me a Coke Zero instead of Diet Coke.  After she came back I told her I didn't think it was a Diet Coke so she brought me a new drink which was correct...however it took a while for her to come back with it.  The food was ok.  A little pricier than I would have liked for what you actually get but I guess that's Scottsdale.  I had the Carne Asada torta that came with fries.  The fries were steak fry style (which I am not a fan of) and they had some kind of seasoning on them that I didn't care for.  The sandwich was actually very good but nothing I would go back for.  My friend had a salad -Aguacate Tomato Mango.  It was more like a plate of wedges of Avocado, Tomato, and mango...no lettuce or anything.  It looked good if you are into that but it wouldn't have been enough of a satisfying meal for me.  My bill with tip came to just under $20 and in my opinion, that was more than I thought it was worth.  It wasn't horrible and I would give it 2 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't let you...so \""Meh, I've experienced better\"" would perfectly sum it up.  I think I would have given it a better review if we sat in the shaded part of the patio and if I had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 plate...the tacos are supposed to be good."
0,Extremely rude workers. This review is for the man standing next to the door with a basket of samples on Saturday afternoon of 1/18/2014 average height with glasses.  We were greeted with a condescending hello and glare. Why would you put someone outside of your store with samples if you aren't going to offer any to customers? I was planning to get a hazelnut truffle but decided not to since he was such a jerk. No samples were offered on our way out either.
4,"I travel to Edinburgh for business quite often, and this is my go to dinner spot. Actually, if they are open, i wouldn't even consider any other spot!\nTheir potatoes are perfectly steamed and toped with whatever you choose, ALL VEGETARIAN! My favorite was the black bean and corn salsa mix, cheese, and salt and pepper. So delicious!"
4,"I have no idea how many times I've been back to Sweet Republic since my first review.  However I have yet to find anyplace else that has ice cream anywhere near as good.  In fact I think it is fair to say that Sweet Republic has ruined me on other ice cream places.  There is no point to going anyplace else, I'll just be disappointed that I am not at Sweet Republic."
4,Seriously the best tacos in town and the kicker - they're only $2 apiece!!  Don't expect any fancy restaurant you'll only find a taco stand outside of the Mexican grocery store with no place to sit but you will find the most delicious tacos and a condiment bar where you can hook your taco up with anything you want.  Where else can you get a ribeye taco for $2??  I go every week - so worth it.  I've tried most of them but my favorites are the ribeye and the roasted pork....you can't go wrong with any of them though!
3,"Airport was very clean and has the nice and funniest employees I have ever dealt with. They were so helpful and even made funny jokes to brighten my day. Hope I have another connecting flight here in the future, would enjoy passing thru again."
3,"Hadn't been to Houston's in a while, but ended up there last night for dinner. \n\nAfter the meal we were wondering why we didn't go more often...\n\nHouston's is delicious...It's in the Hillstone family, so it's like Bandera with a larger menu and less of a southwestern flair. Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.\n\nLast night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.\n\nI've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  \n\n4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. \n\nIf you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend."
0,"I would give it no stars if I could. I was there for a 9man chinese volleyball tourney Labor Day weekend and was \""supposedly\"" guaranteed an online tournament price, but when I checked out they charged me extra and did not reverse it. I called my CC and they had talked to someone at the hotel, and was assured it would be reversed...it hasn't. The check in/check out person didn't know what was going on and I asked for a supervisor/manager but no one came out and she told me this is the charge. A few of my other friends had gotten the same charge and not sure if theirs were finally resolved or not. The Customer service was not there. So for that I wouldn't stay there again."

1,"The guys and I were looking for a place to have some wings on Thursday night hangout.  I found this place and am absolutely floored that Yelp let me down!  This wasn't a case of the kitchen having an off night.  I am honestly surprised that people enjoy any food coming from this place.\n\nAs we came here for wings, it was the first item on the menu I looked at.  There are 8 different flavors to choose from, but don't expect to ask for a sample.  Our waitress immediately stated that we couldn't sample any of the flavors without a $.50 per sauce surcharge.  When asked how hot, I was told they use Frank's Red Hot for their base.  Authentic and Original it ain't.  Portion size is either single or double, which is code for 10 (bone-in) or 20 wings.\n\nI ordered Bone-In and my friends got Bone-less and Chicken Cajun Sliders.  The wings were typical frozen chicken.  The Bone-less were frozen breaded fare I could get from any grocery freezer.  They were dry and bland.  The sauce was definitely heavy on Red Hot, making this one wing experience you can safely skip.  The bone-in wings were average size, and not something I would expect at a buck a piece.  \n\nThe sliders were dry.  The chicken was dry.  The cheese was dry.  The sauce was not a help.  There are only 3 sliders on a plate.  And everything was plated with a HEFTY dose of French's fried onions.  I am not sure why, because they certainly weren't tasty, and added nothing to the meal.  Even the wings came on a bed of french fried onions.\n\nYou would think the atmosphere would have made up for the terrible food.  There are a ton of TVs and Big Screens, perfect for sports fans.  Plenty of comfortable tables, and 3 outdoor patios.  A large bar takes up most of the West side of the building.  But somehow, we were let down again.  During an obviously big game night, we waited 40 minutes for a table when there were a DOZEN open tables all evening.  There was enough people to fill the restaurant, but obviously mgmt wasn't able to staff the establishment properly.  As a consequence, it took almost 30 minutes to get our food order in.  Food did come promptly, but when  you are dumping frozen food into a fryer, this should be a no-brainer.\n\nIf you are going to Desert Ridge, there are many good restaurants to choose from.  Stay away from Wolfleys."
0,"I have yet to have a positive experience here and will be looking for a new doctor now. I've never been able to call and get a straight answer or the right person ever. If it is anything beyond scheduling an appointment, i.e. a simple question such as \""since you can't get me in to see any doctor within the next week, can I get an extension on my prescription until I can see the doctor?\"" you get set into a phone maze, sent to person after person who tell you the exact same thing, \""let me transfer you to someone who can help/the office\"" and then you are back to someone else that can't help you. \n\nI have only been a patient for six months, I've only been into the office twice and have only called three times and I have never had a positive over the phone experience. Of the two times I've gone in, once I had to wait for over an hour past my appointment  time for the doctor and I was the FIRST appointment of the day. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially considering I was there with pneumonia. When I tried to get blood work done, I got caught in the phone maze (actually transferred to the same person three times) only to find out that I didn't need an appointment for blood work even though my doctor told me I needed one, then when I did show up to get it done, the girl \""wasn't in.\""  \n\nOnce I get my prescription filled so I can make it through the next month-- I'm getting a new doctor because Mountain Park Health Center does not deserve any patronage."
0,"Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.\n\nPerhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!\n\nSeriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!\n\nI will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  \n\nSo, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!"
2,"Decent place, good for a chain or mall restaurant but nothing amazing. Poor service but the Americanized Mexican food is pretty solid. My wife likes some of their fruity Margarita offerings but past that the place is a resounding \""meh.\"""
2,"Very nice, yet still casual.   Burger quite delicious.   That is all"
1,"Small portions for the price.\n\nI guess it is ok if you dig the high end dining frech food scene, but it wasn't my thing."
1,The sever forgot about us and my katsu curry tasted like meat gravy. What a waste of my precious hard earned money.
2,It's noodles how can that be bad? Seriously there is something for almost everyone here.
2,"11/03/10\n\nA close coworker and good friend recommended I try Donna's Bakery many, many months ago (maybe even a year ago, whenever it was that it first opened-- the owners are close family friends of hers).  This visit was a spur-of-the-moment decision-- a rare thing for me as I like to do some legwork first before I try a new place.  I even texted my friend for directions and DB's phone number so I could inquire if they were still even open for business that evening!\n\nThe young clerk I met there was very friendly and accomodating-- answering most of my questions w/ firm authority, and when he didn't know the answer, especially that concerning of the large fruit-topped birthday cake in the display case, he'd pop into the kitchen and ask someone for the answer.  I soon met the affable Mr. of Donna's Bakery, who informed me that the Mrs.- Donna- had to leave town that evening, but not before making the very cake I had a fixation on that very morning!  I hadn't planned on making such a purchase, esp. since Mom already had a birthday pass, but he made the cake sound so healthy (made w/ all-natural ingredients-- no powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup!  The fruits were brushed w/ a tapioca-fruit juiced glaze.  I don't think it even had eggs in the batter!), and topped with fresh, sliced fruits (w/ the exception of the maraschino cherries) AND filled w/ more fruit inside!  After selecting a few pastries to take home: a slice of German chocolate-mousse cake; a couple of red-velvet cupcakes w/ icing topped w/ red velvet cake crumbles (!); and something akin to an almond slivered-topped and flattened mocha cream puff (not pictured), Mr. Donna kindly offered a 10% discount on the cake.  Still hesitant in purchasing such a big item I hadn't had a chance to sample, I splurged and brought the cake home.  \n\nNone of the smaller items wowed me (I found the cakes' texture to be very tender, yet lacking in moisture- strange), but that birthday cake was very, very good!  The layers were made of angel cake, and I LOVED the fruit-and-cream filling the most!  Mom didn't think much of the slice she had, but she was going through a period of a few months when she wasn't craving anything sweet, which was a good thing!  So, I sliced the rest of the cake and brought it to work-- everyone who had caved in to the temptation loved it.  Some even had seconds and thirds!!\n\nI plan on going back to try a few savory items that sounded good on the menu!"
0,"Came thinking we could have a shake and frys, expecting to get refills on our fries was told they were franchise and they didn't Jane to follow the rules."
4,"Ah.. Joe's.  I think this is home to perhaps the best meal I have ever had in Las Vegas.. second to Nobu.  \n\nI try to visit every time I am in Vegas.  Their service has always been great and the restaurant is a little brighter (ie less romatic) so it's great for casual dining.  They also have a seating area that extends out the front into the forum shops so you can people watch if you want.\n\nCrab claws are basically what they are known for but what makes me want to go back is the beef.  I always get a NY strip and it's always done to perfection.  Sides are great and perfect for sharing.  French fried sweets, roasted sweet corn, asparagus, it's all very tasty.  \n\nTheir banana cream pie is also a winner.  \n\nThe thing that sets this place above others though is the seasoning mix they give you to put on your steak.  It is quite simply the perfect blend of seasonings that bring out the flavor of your steak.\n\n5 Stars!!"
1,"I didn't realize that ''Complete Petmart'' was now a PetCo.  I was looking for the hours for the Huntersville store online yesterday & noticed this new location.  I shop at PetCo often since, of the chain stores, they have the best selection of aquarium fish & supplies.  I was thrilled to see there was a new one so close to home--about time the Univ/Northlake area get one.  So we pile in the dog-mobile and head over today to check'em out.  \n\nUmmmmm......THIS is PETCO?  As in the national retailer synonymous with vast selections of everything animal-related under one roof???  This store is S-M-A-L-L  small.   I've seen larger pet stores in Manhattan (where smallish stores are normal).  This small-store concept would work much better downtown Charlotte or Midtown/Metro.  But in the 'burbs?  Just doesn't cut it.\n\n-- AQUARIUMS/FISH/ETC:\nFuggettaboutit!   ''Excuse me sir, when will  your aquatic dept be up 'n running?''  ''We aren't gonna have fish at this store; it's something they're doing in all their small-concept-stores'''.  \n .... innnteresting.  No supplies either.  The only aquatic life they carry are feeder goldfish.  So if you have a large fish that eats small fish for lunch/treats, then you're in luck.  Otherwise, keep it moving.  Don't let the wall of empty tanks with backgrounds taped to the front of them fool ya.  They won't be utilized (at least that's the plan at this point).  \n\n-- DOGS/CATS/FURRY FRIENDS:\nSlim selection of dog food brands other than those such as Science Diet and one's that can be found at places like Target (ie: PurinaOne).  It was slim pickings on some of the slightly lesser-known (yet no less ridiculously expensive) brands like we use--Royal Canin--and others such as IAMS.   I never pay attention to the cat section since I don't have one, but that selection appeared to be comparable.\nAlso, it appeared that a selection of merchandise for ''critters'' such as hamsters was non-existent.  Don't take me to the bank on that though.  Also another section I typically bypass altogether.\n\n-- TOYS/BEDS/ACCESSORIES:\nI will say that they shined in this area.  We were surprised at the selection of toys, treats, leashes, harnesses, etc.   They even had a few things here that I hadn't seen at the larger stores.  If you're in the mood to pick up your ''child'' a new toy or a tasty new rawhide after work one day, then this is a good option, especially if you want to avoid the ''big box'' lines.\n\nOh, and I was able to nab two mini \""_______ for dummies'' books - first aid for dogs for dummies and pet stain removal for dummies for only a buck each.  So they made two dollars off me today.  A banner sales day I'm sure!\n\nAll-in-all I'm very disappointed in this location.  It's entirely too small & cramped (a ''department'' consists of only 1-3 aisles).  The selection is inadequate.  And most importantly (for me anyway), no aquarium section.  Well ok, they did have a hand full of artificial plants.  So for me, I'll continue to patronize the Huntersville store.  I'll give'em an A for effort though."
4,"This is my go to and send to for anyone visiting or a local.  Love the drink selection and recipes.  All the mixologists are spot on ith presentation and palate selection.  If you're looking to get a vodka soda or something to that degree you may want to try something out of your comfort zone and go with their specialty cocktails.  It's got great outdoor and indoor seating for groups and one-on-one type convo which is great.  Days for being busy and energetic are hit and miss but it's more of a place to enjoy the people your with and maybe starting light conversation with a fellow patron.  Everyone is always very polite, professional and knowledable.  They also have a private room for rent for private parties which is great as well.  Always my go to for any type of classy or casual occassion."
0,this place blows. how many shoe and embossed Jesus picture dealers do you need? if you're in the market for bootleg stuff and grey market goods this is the place. Could count on one hand how many used stuff dealers there were. save your $2.
2,"It is SO unique.  Provolone vs. Mozz is the key.  This is a cheesey pizza, and hard to classify (not pan, Chicago, or NY... just different).  I come from NY/NJ so I know about good pizza.  This isn't anything like what I get back home, so I won't compare it to NY style.  I simply appreciate how different it is.  \n\nMessy, bring some good utensils until the pizza cools off!  (I gotta knock them for the cheapo fork and knives they provide, which melt upon contacting the bubbling cheese)."
2,"3.5 stars.\n\nIt was dead on a Saturday night but they must have had a lot of takeout/delivery orders because they had run out of green curry by 7:30pm.  Kinda crazy!  \n\nThe menu was set up well since there were photos for everything which made it much easier to know exactly what was coming. We started with the \""Duck Spicy Salad\"" since this was something I'd never seen before.  The salad consisted of duck with pineapple, raisin, tomato, red onion, cilantro, green onion and spicy lime sauce.  That was 360 degrees of flavor although I would've preferred a little less duck skin. \n\nI checked out Dan \""Thai Food Addict\"" P's review on my phone and he got the Khao Soi.  I'd never tried Khao Soi and it's not offered in a lot of Thai spots so what the heck.  The only way I could explain it would be imagine if Thailand had ramen.  It had a really good curry broth with 3 kinds of beef (sliced, tendon and chunks) with soft egg noodles along with crispy egg noodles.  I also agree with Dan that there should have been more noodles but maybe it's because I liked it a lot.  My wife got the tofu red curry which was fine.  \n\nCorner Thai has a big sign out front saying they serve the best Thai food in Vegas.  That's a pretty bold statement that they don't live up to, but it's a fine neighborhood spot."
0,"Literally amazed.  13 days to send out a technician to hook up our new Internet connection.  Believe it.  Couldn't get Cox in our condo building unfortunately, so we're stuck with Century Link - some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced from a service provider.  The only saving grace - the folks on the phone were very nice... Albeit useless and unable to send out anybody to help us out earlier.  Truly amazing."
1,"normally the food and service are great, but Sunday the food and service was cold - what's up with this?"
1,"Nothing special.  Has the usual variety of egg dishes, pancakes, omelets, etc.  The wait can be long for weekend brunch.  If it gets longer than 20 minutes, I would just go somewhere else.  It's obviously very popular, but not in a trendy/hip way - more of a classic way.  It's a good place for families."
1,"This place is more inconsistent than outright bad.  It is more authentic than the fast food joins that claim to be Mexican or MadMex.\n\nOur most recent visit was during the lunch rush (mistake numero one) and our party of four all ordered the same dish with a different protein (mistake numero dos).  The chips were not deal-breaker stale, but I refused to try to Guac since 1) the gentleman was only wearing one glove and 2) not a big fan of avocado.  A good (we did have fun talking and mingling in the loud quarters) forty five minutes passed before our meals arrived which turned the table into an eating frenzy since we were stretching the definition of a lunch hour.\n\nMistake numero tres was made then we asked for separate checks.  Apparently our overburdened (to her defense, the house was PACKED) waitress didn't catch our request right off the bat when we first sat down.  After fifteen minutes of muttering in Spanish (which BTW I'm from Puerto Rico so I really didn't appreciate what was muttered) we all got our checks.\n\nAt first I was going to give it a one-star.  But my burrito and the rice with beans were really good so I would return for the food itself.  The service and the timing of our visit ... those left it wide open for improvement."
2,"3 stars is generous. Food was actually good, had a perfectly medium rare steak. Chicken fried steak looks and taste amazing. Service is a different story. \n\nThe hostess is on the grave shift is very polite, she seated us immediately, even got us drinks when the waitress was occupied. Other than that, service was abysmal. Our table was ignored through the whole meal. Did not once get a refill, my plate had the wrong eggs, wait staff visited and checked up on every table but ours."
4,"Years ago a friend of ours named Jerry, started SuperShuttle to go to LAX from the Inland Empire and to Ontario.  He used to work for Anheuser Bush.  Maybe now he  regrets selling it since it has become such an awesome, giant co.  Still as great as ever!  If you ever read this Jerry give our love to Sue and the girls!"
3,Food was tasty.  Definitely better than many of the other reviews suggested.  I had the chicken enchilada and chili relleno combination.  2 for 1 special on the combination right now.  Great deal for dinner.
3,"1st day in Phoenix and stopped here for body fuel after a long road trip from Atlanta and I am excited to say, I have found my first favorite place in Phoenix!! The gyro was amazing and the lamb was tender and deelish. I am def going to try the greek salad next time since a customer who was enjoying it himself made sure to advise that I do so my next time! Matter of fact...ON MY WAY THERE NOW!"
2,"The green chile sauce has a lot of flavor but the pork really is rather bland.  I opted to get the enchantment platter(?) - basically a try everything plate.  \n\nBy far the best thing was the chicken enchiladas.  It had good flavor, the meat was moist and seasoned.  Yum..  The pork stuff chile was decent too though a bit on the bland side.  I asked for pico de gallo which helped it a bit.  The carne acevedo(?) burrito wasn't bad, but even more on the bland side.  The sopapilla that came with the platter was pretty good, I didn't even put honey on it.  The worst thing about the plate was all the cheese.  I'm a fan of molty cheese, but this was just way too much.  There had to be like half a block on the plate.\n\nWe also tried the green chile pork stew which was decent..  The chile had a pretty big kick.  Somehow the dish didn't come together well.  Just tasted like veggie soup with green chile salsa in it.  The worst thing was the pork that was overcooked and dry in it.  \n\nThe pricing is a bit high, even for happy hour.  The atmosphere and menus are creative.  The service was pretty good when we went, but we were there early for lunch (~11am).  Decent place, maybe I'll try the nachos next time."
4,"Went to dinner here with a party of 16 and the service was great.  The beer is a little pricey though so prepare to spend a little there.\n\nI had the Chicken Pot Pie and it was amazing, served in cast iron pot and piping hot with tasty crust on top.  Also had a side of macaroni and cheese and was also very very good and creamy.\n\nWill definitely go back to this place again!!"
4,"Just got back from anniversary dinner with my husband and toddler. I am very pleased with the experience from start to finish! This place is gorgeous and we were seAted in a lovely booth. We started off with their plate of sesame bread and smooth butter and their succulent crab cake with tons of lump meat. I also had the del salad with creamy avocado dressing, bacon, and tomatoes. My son had lobster Mac which was one of their sides. It was very rich and creamy, just how you would imagine it to be, son loved it, but too rich for my blood. Hubby ordered the 12 oz filet with peppercorn sauce cooked medium rare. Looked beautiful, tasted heavenly, a little on the seasoned side though but melted in your mouth. The sauce was overpowering though, although on the side, a little dab will do you.    I ordered their special, sea bass with pesto fingerling potatoes and balsamic cherry tomatoes. The fish was cooked perfectly! Skin was left on for crunch And seAled in flavor but I don't prefer eating the skin so I peeled it off. It was a juicy buttery fish with cooked center how I like it. \nFor dessert we had creme brulee and took home their lemon layer cake. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is Belgian white chocolate with some hint of cinnamon to it, nice and creamy but I have had better. The lemon cake is just right. Not too heavy, not too sweet. The icing is like glaze on a lemon bundt cake, the cake isn't too rich. Very good!\n\nService was great! We had a cute young waitress and this place was popping for a Thursday night at 5:45! \nDef recommend!"
4,Awesome food. Great happy hour.  Amazing staff.  Excellent atmosphere.  The Big Roll is worth it!
2,"Mediocre at best. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was the service was great, actually it was almost too good. I'm pretty sure our server was the owner. She came to our table no less than 5 times to see if everything was good.  I got some kind of chicken dish lunch special and it had a fishy taste to it......ambiance is nice, the food is only so-so. I definitely won't be back."
3,"This place was unexpectedly great.  I had the three meat sampler, which was supposed to include brisket, ribs, and pulled pork, but they were out of brisket and subbed in chicken instead.  Once the food came I didn't complain.  The ribs were smoky and flavorful, the pulled pork was moist and flavorful, and the chicken had a great bbq flavor.  \n\nFor sauce, there is Sweet Baby Ray's at every table, which I was disappointed by, but when the food came the girl who served it brought out something called 'Moose Sauce', which is apparently named after a dog who happens to fancy it.  Or something.  Either way, it was excellent, and has sharp flavors of cider vinegar and cinnamon with a spicy tomato base.  It was unique and definitely beats Sweet Baby Ray's.\n\nI also ordered the cowboy beans and the 'deconstructed' cole slaw as sides, and they too were excellent.  The beans were served in a perfect bbq sauce, and the cole slaw was 'deconstructed' - meaning the sauce for it came on the side and you had to mix it in.  I thought this was a great idea, and have never seen it before, because it made the cole slaw perfectly crispy and crunchy, never allowing it to get soggy.  The cole slaw sauce was a sweet buttermilk ranch flavor, and was also excellent.\n\nOn top of all this, you get a deep fried dinner roll, which is simultaneously sinful, indulgent, and amazing.\n\nMy only complaint is that, for first timers at least, there is a little confusion on what to do when you walk in the door.  We weren't sure if it was counter service or table service, so a little stand-up sign by the door indicating what to do would be great."
4,The food and custom cocktails are excellent and the cosy atmosphere with the help of friendly staff keeps me coming back.
4,"I'm a savory girl over sweet any day--except, apparently, at Bouchon.\n\nKnowing that Bouchon has a reputation for stellar pastries, I ordered the beignets du jour as a brunch appetizer. I figured I'd have a bite and that would be that. The beignets arrived, two lacrosse ball-sized puffs coated in granulated sugar and stuffed with fresh, flavorful, raspberry preserves. They were so insanely delicious that I ate both of them to crumbs. My husband is lucky he got a bite.\n\nHis pecan roll was also quite good, though it was no beignet du jour. Bloody Marys were well-made, albeit a bit expensive ($13 I believe). For the main courses, my husband had the American breakfast, which he enjoyed but which also seemed pretty standard to me (eggs cooked to your liking, sausage, bacon, toast, etc.). I had the famous chicken and waffles and it was another OMG-experience. The chicken was so perfectly cooked, very moist and tender. True to my savory roots, I primarily used the gravy for the dish rather than the syrup or the vanilla bean butter, but those of you with more of a sweet tooth would like those a lot.\n\nI'd be remiss to not also mention the fabulous preserves served with the complimentary bread. Bouchon must make their jams themselves--otherwise I am really missing the boat by not buying this stuff myself.\n\nWe had a really hard time finding Bouchon. The Venetian and Palazzo are gigantic, sprawling properties, and the entrance to Bouchon is an understated doorway near the check-in desk. You then have to take an elevator to another floor to access the restaurant. Just be aware that you will have to look around a little bit to find the place. But do look for it--worth it!"
4,"What a wonderful place to get some color, I had Klaire \""one of the owners\"" do a personal spray tan on me and I was amazed with the results! Highly skeptical as I have fair skin and most sprays have turned me orange, not the case here. I looked great and felt even better. They have the best equipment and great employees. The gentleman at the counter was highly knowlegable and quite handsome as well;)"
1,"This place has a nice decor and is in a good location and I suspect that is the only reason why it's been busy so far since it just opened.  The food is very white-wash.  Yea, I said it, white wash!  The pho broth absolutely has NO flavor.  We ordered the papaya salad and asked our waiter to ask the chef to make it \""Lao\"" style (we know that the restaurant cooks are mostly Laotian people and wanted it more authentic with all the real ingredients, like stinky fish/shrimp paste, fermented crab etc.) the waiter looked at us confused.  We told him we just wanted it authentic.  He assured us it is authentic and delicious.  I was NOT comforted by that and told my sister not to order it, but she did anyways.  It came out and was nothing BUT, shredded papaya with lime juice, tomatoes, and peanuts.  Now if you like \""white washed\"" papaya, then it's fine, however just don't expect the real thing.  I wouldn't mind if the waiter knew that it was NOT authentic, and just told us the kitchen didn't have/keep all the ingredients to a Lao style papaya salad.  I've been to places that simply told me that, and I still got the papaya salad anyways just to try.  But it wasn't just the flavor that gets you...the portion is also very small.  It is not worth the $6 or $7 dollars they charge at all!\n\nOh and be ware of one of the server.  She's a nice and kind Asian lady,  when she serves she carries food tray out on her shoulders.  She's petite so it must make it easier for her, however, her hair is shoulder length (and curly) and I've noticed her hair brushes the food on the tray especially the rice...I've noticed this on more than one occasion.  Yes I've been there twice despite my 2 stars... I was extremely sick the first time I went there, and decided to give them a second chance.\n\nOh yes I also should mention, the kitchen takes FOREVER to cook.  Both times we were there, the whole meal took over 2 hours!!!!  The restaurant was NOT busy and there was only 4 of us."
3,"Great breakfast and lunch spot. You would want to go here for dinner, too, but it closes at 3:05 p.m. I've wondered why it's 3:05, but I decided that maybe it's to give you 5 minutes to get in at the last minute. If not, oh well that's just my speculation. I have found it difficult to order because everything on the menu sounds good. I have eaten and loved the Banana's Foster French Toast, the Loaded Omelette and the Turkey Pesto on Focaccia. Yum Yum Yum. Oh I almost forgot I had the Blueberry Blast Smoothie and it was delicious- pretty much everything is good! They are also right next to the light rail. I like that A LOT! But beware, it's always busy, so it might not be a good place if you literally only have minutes. Another plus, is the patio is dog friendly. The patio is my favorite place to sit because of the great people watching opportunities on Mill Ave, but I wish it was a little bigger."
3,"My friends and I went in because they were next to a shop on Mill, to our delight, it was Really good!  Some of us are vegetarian and they had quite a selection. The Clara burro and beans were awesome. For the non vegetarians in the group they loved the special chicken Mole, and great flan for desert. Although my friend got the last flan, apparently it goes fast, it would be a bummer if they were out and you came for it. Our waitress Sherry was really nice! Not fancy atmosphere for an impressive date, but very clean.  And they serve Beer. Will try to make this a future stop again."
4,"Ting Thai Caravan is somewhere i'd heard good things about for a while but failed to visit for some reason. I remedied that last weekend and how glad I am that I did. It's a bold statement, I know but Ting Thai is, in my opinion, the best Thai food you'll find in Edinburgh.\n\nThe interior is smallish with a stripped-back 'warehouse chic' style to it. Diners eat in a communal sort of setting at long bench tables, with enough space to remain private yet create a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is extensive and separated into sections; curries, rice/noodles, small dishes, snacks etc. It contains a lot of authentic Thai dishes that you won't find on the ubiquitous menu at a run-of-the-mill Thai restaurant. I had the fish steamed in a banana leaf and crispy tofu. The flavours were spectacular and without doubt the best Thai cuisine i've tried outside of Thailand. In fact, it was better than some of the food I had in Thailand!\n\nStaff are friendly and service is very efficient and speedy. It's not somewhere you'd kick back and spend a few hours relaxing with drinks but that's not what it sets out to do. What it does is offer extremely good Thai dishes in a 'street food' style. Street food is something of a foodie trend at the moment but Thing Thai is much more than a gimmick. And for the prices they charge, it's astonishingly good value."
1,"I went outside for several minutes and waited on the benches while my clothes were drying, and I came back in to discover that my laundry bag was thrown in the trash and my $13 detergent bottle was put in their lost and found. I could understand if it had been sitting their all afternoon, but seriously it hadn't even been some 15 minutes and there were barely any customers there. So it couldn't have been more obvious who they belonged to. And to think, this has happened twice now.\n\nI'll admit the place is clean, but they are also very expensive. Then again, I guess throwing away my laundry bag is part of the cleaning process, and having to buy a new one only adds to the expense of washing my clothes. Real logical."
2,"I don't know too many places like this, nice to bring children to see live animals.\n\nThe cats are strays that they've rescued, the decor is safari themed so it's very nice.\n\nTheir cat food section is not the largest, but it's not their specialty."
0,Made a reservation to celebrate my anniversary a month and a half in advance.  Showed up on anniversary only to find no recollection of reservation.  Chef was arrogant and slow to accommodate.  He even went so far as to mention i would be lucky to eat his food.  We went elsewhere.  There are better places to spend money for excellent food in the Scottsdale area minus the attitude. I will not be patronizing his restaurant ever again.
0,Really wanted to like this place. Brisket was tough and rubbery. Cobbler was average. Hostess lacked warmth and scruples.
0,I decided to try this joint out since it's just around the corner from my house today. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with red and green sauce as I like to mix them. My first few bites were egg and grease only. Grease dripped out of the bottom and top of my burrito. Gross. Why I continued to eat I'm not sure. I hit the bacon in another bite or 2. I'm not even sure it was bacon... I chewed and chewed and chewed. I ended up having to spit it out (Sorry if that was TMI). I opened the burrito to check out the rest of the 'bacon' only to find the worst quality of bacon fat and pools of grease. My appetite was gone. From now on I'll drive the extra few miles to Los Favoritos which is 150% better quality and better prices!
4,I will never set foot in another theatre again!\n\nThe sound.... blew my mind!  The theatre is super open and fantastic.\n\nSaw MIB III.   SUPER!
4,I love this place. Go there a few times a month. The mix papusa is the best. The staff are always helpful and kind and I am so thankful I found this place. My friend has gotten their beef and chicken soup as well. She prefers the beef but they are such hot sellers you have to get there early in order to get it.
1,"I like the store but they recently switched out their baked goods supplier and now they don't have decent chocolate or almond croissants anymore.   Now I have to go to Panera bread, Starbucks or the local bakeries.   Bad move, I hear that a lot of customers are complaining about this."
2,"I think if the walk up counter was gone this place would do a lot better. Waiting in line was not too fun. The person in front of us had a larger modified ticket and was totally annoying to listen to..we  did tip the counter staff and server. We were approached too many times asking if everything was \""good\"" . Burgers were good but first basket of fries was a pile of crumbs. For $6 a basket, there should be fries not crumbs. They were replaced fast but the guy did look offended. I think the service staff really reallyyyy wanted to make a impression so they would get tipped. ( kinda like a buffet, servers hope they get something ) Six plus times asking if something was \""good \"" was overboard. I think if it was just a regular restaurant without the counter it would keep\nThe servers more busy and they would not be stressing if someone was going to tip or not. I do not like being interrupted every bite I take lol. \n\nBurgers were good so don't worry on that part!"
0,"So it's a Friday, and we're a group of colleagues. You know the deal,  large group, high spirits, cause, hey, it's a Friday.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a table large enough to accommodate the size of our group, and we're just trying to figure out how to split ourselves up, when the waiter pounces on some guy who's eating and MOVES him. Ok, that works our for us, but I've never seen a patron pushed off his table mid-meal before in my life. This should have been my first clue.\n\nSo we sit, and 10 minutes or so later, the waiter takes our order. Ask him a few questions, almost all of which are answered in a mumble that sounds like \""yes, it's noodles\"". Same answer to all questions. Well, we're all tech geeks, so a quick search on our phones manages to DE-mystify most of the menu. Second clue as to the service.\n\n40 minutes later, and 1 salad and 2 soups have appeared so far. There's a bit of hunger going on by now. One of my colleagues is eying the remnants of one of the salads, so we push it over to him. \n\n50 minutes in, and HALF of the table is served. Umm, ok.  The remaining 4 of us are patient, and figure we're next.  My colleague is now fiddling with the paper wrapper from the chopsticks and I'm afraid he's going to eat it.\n\n60 minutes in, still no food for the remaining 4, and in the meantime we've watched 3 other tables get served.\n\n70 minutes in, I go remind the server that half of our table is missing food. \""Yeah? It's busy.\""\n\n75 minutes in, and finally the remaining 4 dishes appear. And my salmon teriyaki is RAW.  STONE COLD RAW.\n\n'nuff said. Never again."
2,Not much to say just OK.
4,"Best toy shop in vegas, bought a match box Lesley car which was reasonably priced loaded of others great items would defo go bk when in vegas next time :) 100% best!"
3,"This was the highlight of my downtown trip! The owner is great. The espresso is excellent and the croque monsieur, superb. Good tunes, too. Drop in!"
2,"I am really not sure this place deserves three stars, but not quite two. \n\nThis place seems to be an identity crisis. I went in expecting something like curry in a box- but the menu is all over the place. There are burriots, cajun food, potstickers,  and of course Sri Lakan food ( which explains the curry). The ambiance is okay - nothing special, not bad either.  \n\nMy husband ordered the cashew chicken, in which the chicken was greatly lacking in the sichuzan sauce. The flavor was more teryaki like. \n\nBut there was good. \n- The service was very friendly and server very nice\n- The Mango lassi was really good, not too sweet like most south asian places can be. \n- My chicken curry was warm and well spiced (obvious forte), but still lacking meat.  \n\nI am not sure if I will go back or not. But there menu needs some work."
3,"This place should have scads of glowing reviews! My family loves this place for many good reasons. It is currently in the middle of a major renovation which is why it gets 4 stars for now rather than 5.\n\nWhere to start? This is a full service gym and community center with all kinds of programs to serve individuals and families. If you have kids you MUST check it out. The staff here are super friendly and helpful. The facility is modern and clean, even before the updating.\n\nMy experience of Y's in other parts of the country were not nearly so favorable.  The Harris Branch completely turned around my perception. My daughter attends their child watch program twice a week and is always really excited to go. They have a robust dance program as well which my daughter also attends and loves.\n\nThe pools are terrific: they have a number of indoor and outdoor pools for doing laps and others for families and little kiddies with fountains to play in.\n\nI am not sure how it rates price-wise against local gyms because you get a lot for your money beyond just a place to work out. If you are a single person who just wants to lift weights/ do cardio you might be able to find something cheaper. If you have a family or are looking for a social component as well as a gym, this place can't be beat."
0,"Food was ok but came out staggered.  Waitress was horrible.  Had to ask several times for refills .  they were out of root beer, sausage, asparagus. bartender was off duty. over all very disappointed.  Will never return--or refer anyone to come here."
0,The worse drive through ever. If you want to wait 20 mins in line come here. I can see this maybe happening here and there. But out of 8 times I've been here only one time in which  I did not have to wait less then 5 mins. Just got to the screen 14 mins after waiting. So another 5 mins and hopefully I will be out of here.
3,Went for a late night meal. Decided to check out the new SLS hotel and tried Griddle Cafe. The Pancake Boozy Shake was incredible - I had the Golden Ticket. I also had the Eggs Benidict. Instead of using English muffins they used potato skins. Yummy! I will be back to try the pancakes next time and get another boozy shake.
3,"They seem to draw in sports greats. I met Dick Butkus last week in here. \n\nIt's a little pricey, especially if you're buying something to have signed, they charge you the signed price. You can work them down though, they wanted $99 for a picture, $299 for a football, $69 for a mini helmet, and $400 for a jersey. I was reluctant and was just going to get the helm for my buddy that's a huge bears fan, but they said they would throw in the picture and football if I got the jersey for $400 and that's when they sank the hook in...So I ended up with a jersey and gave my friend the football and picture.  \n\ncool experience all around."
3,"I won't say it's the best Thai in Las Vegas, because it's more of a fusion than authentic Thai (the distinction of \""Best Authentic Thai\"" belongs to Lotus of Siam, on Sahara). However, the service is friendly, the cocktails are strong, and the crab rangoons are some of the best I've ever had. This is one of my favorite dinner spots for catching up with friends. Will return again and again."
4,"I have found my new favorite spot!!!  A little over one week new to the area and the word is out!   I have read the great reviews from the one they opened in the Henderson area and was eager to try this place out.  \n\nAs we walked in everything was a little overwhelming at first.  Since it is new they had greeters at the front ready to explain their concept and how it all works.  Its all pretty simple - Salad, Soup and/or Sandwich.  A combo includes your choice of 2 for $7.99.  This is similar to the Chipotle style assembly line thing where you tell the servers what you want and they will assemble what you choose.  There is an assorted number of fresh toppings to choose from-meats, cheeses, veges, pastas, nuts, fruits, croutons etc. Better ingredients than any salad bar I've ever been to.  They had a wide range of dressings as well as many fat free and low fat choices which I thought was fantastic!  So you can opt for their salads choices or you can build your own.  If you build your own salad they give your choice of 6 ingredients. You can also choose to add toppings to your soup for $.59.  They have many sandwiches to choose from.  The Ciabatta bread they use is fresh, soft and airy.  \n\nHere's a rundown of what we ordered:\n\n*Asian BBQ Pork sandwich - Very flavorful - BBQ sauce was tasty\n*Salad (create your own). Romaine with Sesame Ginger dressing (fat free & amazing flavor), chicken, ground cashews, feta, apples and croutons - this was my favorite overall\n*The Italian sandwich - BF really liked the flavor and balsamic spread it had\n*Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Bisque - was amazing with a little kick and lobster flakey chunks to compliment (I've been to steak houses that don't have this much lobster)\n\nEach combo came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The drink section has your choices of \""syrups\"" to add to your soda.  Recommended recipes are written on the drink cups to give you an idea of how it works.  My BF did the \""rootbeer float\"" mixture - 2 squirts of vanilla to your rootbeer.  It was very tasty and was exactly to be expected.  I forgot to mention that had some amazing looking desserts but it was already enough food.  Maybe desserts to-go next time.  BTW you can get any of the food to-go.\n\nThe customer service was great.  We were nicely greeted by everyone we came in contact with.  Since its new everyone was on their A game and happy to be there.  I hope that continues.  The place was very clean (new still) and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money on the bright and vibrant d\u00e9cor inside and out.  Its very modern and open with plenty of seating.  They have the recharge bar-but I have no idea what that was about yet.\n\nAs we were indulging in our new found favorite food stop we were already planning on coming back the next day.  So as we drove up on Sunday our hearts sank - CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.  Wah wah waahhh.  Sad face.  No worries.  I intend to be back ALOT just not on Sunday.."
3,"So my lovely aunt and I have our weekly lunch outings and she always takes me to  places i never heard of. To top it off  she takes me to places that are in the hood. As I was driving there i was thinking \"" ummm aunty where are we going im scuuuuured\""?! Anyways my rambling has nothing to do with the review.. \n\nSo I surveyed the scene.. It located in an old shopping plaza.. don't be scured cause looks can be so deceiving..  Place looks pretty clean. This is a hole in the wall establishment. So course the food is good!\n\nWe ordered the Asian BBQ ribs which comes with garlic rice. I must admit it's the best damn ribs that i have had here in Las Vegas! The meat itself was not rubbery and chewy like in some BBQ places like Lucille's or Dave's , the meat was perfect, along with the seasoning. I was licking that bone like i was a dog!!\n\nAnother dish we ordered was the Beef Tagalog with onions. This dish is really good as well, it comes with rice and again the meat was perfect. The texture was really tender and juicy just like the ribs,.\n\nWe spoke to the owner ray, he will soon bring lasagna into the menu. So it wont be Asian for long maybe it will be a Fusion type thing..\n\n This place has just opened. Heck! I'm going back to order the RIBS! According to the staff people order this on their way home from work for take out order.\n\nTry this place now and order the Asian BBQ Ribs you will not be disappointed!"
2,"Been going to Barro's since they began.  It's my favorite pizza.\nHigh school buddies and I would go at lunch, and I became a fan way back then.\nI like the thick, doughy crust, the sauce that a few folks I know say is too sweet, the generous portions of meat and veggie toppings,...\n[SCREEEEECH] \n\""Honey, stop the review!  Go back.  We didn't get that.\""\nLunch today was a little dissapointing, since I ordered premade slices, and the one which was supposed to have sausage on it only had two little nickel-sized spheres of meat on the whole slice.\nWhen I showed it to the counter girl and she looked at me like, \""...and?\""  I got more specific and asked if I could have another slice.  \nShe said, \""Well, I'll have to throw that one away if I give you another piece.\""\nI looked at her like, \""...and?\"" and said, \""As long as it's got more sausage, I don't care, so, yes, I want the other slice.\""\nShe looks at the last sausage slice and rolls her eyes back over my way, informing me that this last piece only has 3 pieces of meat on it, so I tell her to forget it.  I used to be a lot more offended by uber-be-otch behavior from post-teen spilt-tails, but I have paid some dues as a married man, and I have built up a tolerance, I guess.  \nI'll be back to this Barro's to give them a chance at redemption, since my other standy by local pizza turned success story (Sardella's) is nothing but a big dissapointment lately, too."
1,"I like Sprouts but I recently had a bad experience with the check out lady.  She was engaged in a personal conversation with another employee when I was putting my items on the belt.  She said, Hi how are you today... which I replied I was good and asked how she was.  She continued her conversation with other employee, I had a bag of vegetables that a hole had ripped, so I pointed it out to her so she wouldn't spill the, etc.   I thought she might have got another bag or had someone else get me one, that would have been the right thing to do.  Instead, she didn't say anything about it, just went right on with her conversation.  She said, hi how are you today.....AGAIN, this time I didn't say anything.. I felt like telling her she already asked me that and I already responded.   Not great customer service, I always hope there is someone else working, but sadly it's almost always her when I shop.   Their green beans were disappointing, lots of brown spots and very thin ones, non usable.   I like the new bags they have for the bulk foods, however, you have to write the SKU number on them first before filling them up and well that's hard to do sometimes, not a ton of room and the pens don't stretch to far.   Better customer service will make me come back, pay attention to the customer, your personal conversation can wait."
4,Awesome food...I want to go back.
1,"I got my food after everyone else at my table. As in, they had already started clearing everyone else's plates. \n\nThe pizza was OK. I've had better at CPK and Oregano's. \n\nWe ordered J\u00e4ger bombs and they were out of red bull. \n\nThe pizza cookie was not as good as some of the other restaurants of their likeliness."
3,"I was attending a convention at the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center and my group decided to stay at the brand new SLS Hotel. Logistically it worked out well. A quick 5-minute walk to the CC (which is often less that you'd spend waiting in other hotels' taxi cues) and also a reasonably close taxi ride from other Strip locations.\n\nThe hotel is as hip, cool, trendy, fashion-foward as one would expect from the SLS brand. Creative restaurants, bars, and clubs. I stayed in the World Tower and the room was comfortable, clean, and well appointed. The mini-bar is well stocked, and the bath products are very nice.\n\nMy complaint has to do with the check-in process. My reservation had been inexplicably canceled, so I had to go through some hurdles to check in. It took about an hour until I was finally in my room.\n\nAnother hassle was that I specifically added my girlfriend's name to my room when I checked in. \""No problem it's taken care of\"" I was told. When my girlfriend arrived to get her key she was told her name wasn't on the room.  Now at that point I was actually already gone, and in a different country (don't ask), so she too ended up having to wait almost an hour while I was tracked down, the hotel emailed me with a number of questions, and ultimately they gave her a key. On one hand I appreciate the security measures of not giving out keys to anyone who says they're supposed to have one, but please don't tell me \""its taken care of\"" if it wasn't.\n\nSo in conclusion, I'll likely stay there again, but I hope they get their front-desk issues resolved."
4,"Best high-end food I've had in the Phoenix area ever. I live in SF (near CA wine country) and this place could hold its own against some of our most impressive dining options. Kudos to the owners and chef for creating such a wonderful oasis in suburban Chandler.\n\nWhen we went there it was half price bottle night (Tuesday), so we were able to score a bottle of Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc, normally $50, for $25. This is less than it sells retail. And every single food item we tried had exceptional flavor while incorporating unusual twists (like a bbq flavor in the duck confit and caramel popcorn on our salad). \n\nI really hope this restaurant's prices don't scare people away. If I lived here, I'd be coming here all the time. If the dinner tab seems a hefty cost to start, try brunch, happy hour, or maybe just a glass of wine at the bar. But this place is so worth it, especially for the half price wine special."
2,Overpriced but nevertheless tasty. They have a full Chinese menu that attracts me to such a old-school casino as Bill's Gamblin' Hall. Their fried-rice is very good and is offered in large portions. ...Wifey enjoyed the won ton soup.
3,Been here for breakfast many times.  Lunch only a few.  Great American food with speedy service and fair prices.   Only four stars because of the wait on the weekends which actually shows how good this place really is. Never been during the week but it would be a regular lunch destination if I worked downtown.
3,Great Sandwiches. The corn fritters are amazing.
1,"It must have been an off night, but my wings were horrible.  We ordered several different flavors and they were all bland and greasy.  The temperature at the place must have been over 80' and the decor looked worn down like our waitress."
3,"Having frequented \""Barbacoa\"" in Tokyo, Japan, which has a very similar concept, I was both impressed and disappointed with Texas de Brazil. \n\nImpressed - salad bar was superb with a lot of high-end offerings\n\nDisappointed - Meat selection was good, but have seen a more extensive and better offering from Barbacoa in Tokyo\n\nFor a price of $46 dollars per person, you get what you come for and it's a fun experience for those who have never been. With 2 drinks, a dessert and 2 plates, our total bill came to about $130 dollars + tip. Not too bad considering the premium the strip normally places on it's restaurants!"
2,"They were okay. I wouldn't say they were great.  They were very nice and offered us bottles of water since it was so warm in there. Ceiling fans, but no AC? Really?  They were quite busy and as I was getting a pedicure a lady walked in who apparently made an appointment and they had no time to accommodate her. They asked her to come back tomorrow, she said that she couldn't and that's why she had made an appointment for this date/time. I felt bad for her, they accepted two walk ins before she showed up. If you know you have upcoming appointments, you should state that and ask the walk ins to come back or wait. Not the other way around.  Also, the quality of my pedi wasn't that great. Guess I'll keep looking. Cheap? Yes. Worth it? Meh! I didn't think so."

2,"My friends and I stopped at the Chop House for brunch.  I ordered the create your own omelette. When the order came out, I was a but underwhelmed by the size of the meal, especially on the size of the plate that I received. The Chophouse should really use smaller plates for brunch and not the big plates used for the steaks. Nothing like getting a big plate with about half the plate full of food. I really enjoyed the hash browns. The hash browns were nice and crispy and had a great taste. \n\n\nService was good. There was a foul up on an order at the table. The server offered a solution and went to go fix it but then went to hang out at another table to gab. I was basically done with my meal (as well as someone else) by the time the fix came.\n\nOverall the experience was good, but not great.\n\n\n3.5"
0,"I stayed here the second time for the sin city shootout softball tournament in January.  This was my second time. \n\nLast year I had no problems, but this year I was assigned to the second floor near the front entrance.  The first shower I took, the water pressure was strong coming out of the tub, but when switched to the shower, the water pressure barely came out.  I called the front desk and they transferred me to housekeeping.   Then a maintenance worker came into the room to replace the air filter.  He said he knew nothing about the shower head being broken.  I asked him to fix it, but he said he was only doing air filter replacements.  He told me to call back to the front desk.  \n\nThis continued 3 more times from Thursday and Friday.  Finally I asked to be moved to a different room.  Front desk told me they were sold out at my room rate and if I wanted to move, I would have to pay the difference.  Totally terrible customer service.  I ended up showering in my neighbor's room for the rest of my stay.  \n\nSo when I got home, I completed the survey they emailed me.  I received an email response from Shelby Masacek on 1-24-2014 apologizing and asking me to personally call him or her when planning my next visit.  Really??  That is your response??  OK, that won't happen because I will NEVER stay there again.  \n\n#1, being all defensive about the shower head.  I mean really, it is a $15 shower head.  Did they expect me to go to home depot and buy it myself?  If they are willing to loose a returning customer over a $15 shower head, then what else can happen?  \n\n#2, Refusing to move me.  Speaks for itself.  \n\n#3, There are so many customer service problems here with the staff, that I don't feel it will change or that this is an isolated incident.  The wifi also was on and off.  I didnt mention that because I spent all my time showering in my neighbors room. \n\n#4  Shining Light:  I ate a few times at the cafe.  Totally delicious and the staff there were amazing.  Even after the parties let out, they were swamped but they did an incredible job.   That restaurant GM should take over the entire hotel if they want to save it.  \n\nFinally, Guests expect to be pampered in Vegas, not put on the defensive or be expected to solve customer service problems.  The New Tropicana really fell short of my expectations."
0,"Lol! Pretty bad when your own employee slams you in the other review! I hired these traitors to represent me in a breach of contract case. After taking a 35% discount just to end it, the other side put terms in the agreement not on the court record! This firm threatened me and said I had to accept the revised version never mentioned in court. I refused. They are now suing me for monies they never collected, which was a contingency agreement. The lawyer I had kept making remarks like \""you have more money than I\"" and \""you'll lose at trial\"" because the jury will resent your looks and success, (even though I have a contract stating I am soley the one that placed the lucrative investments). I saved my partner from certain ruin, since he had 0 investment experience and was loaning millions on a handshake at 5% interest. What a moron! I made him 13% secured interest in hard money loans and bought 25 reos that most have tripled in value. a con artist, my ex is involved with started selling all the assets below cost, just to keep from paying my share. He is how getting my paycheck, even though he never invested ONE penny for us and has lost over a million dollars of LLC assets. I went to court and froze the remaining properties from being sold. He and the con artist then broke into my home and robbed me, then locked me out. Now she, (lawyer) is ganging up with ex's lawyer in trying to force me to not make an insurance claim! She also says I won't recover any of the intentional million dollar losses caused by the con artist in FRONT of the other side. She is so stupid she is unaware of the definition of MANDATORY FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. She is a lying, conniving back stabbing c%^&. It has nothing to do with our biz contract and he claims he's innocent, but keeps dodging the insurance company, who wants a statement. She said I deserved to lose my personal property, some of which were priceless family heirlooms iIdidn't have the extra coverage on. She is obviously on their payroll and is clearly jealous of my expertise, looks and success. She now wants another $100,000 on top of the $20,000 I already paid for doing nearly nothing, no discovery, no depos, just \""talking\"" to others at her firm about my case and forcing me into taking a majorly discounted settlement she can't even collect. I am the one that did all the property comps. She's a pathological liar, who only cares about her over inflated, undeserved fees, not recovering my rightful, hard earned share. She's so stupid. she wanted to go to settlement before appraising the business. (Rack up those bills!) I had to tell her we needed an appraisal first. she has 0 strategical or negotiating skills, rather threatens and intimidates her own clients, instead of the opposing side. 3 lawyers have read the court settlement and said it states nothing about I cant make an insurance claim for my burglary. She told me court was a week ago. i was halfway to Las Vegas (200 miles), when she emailed me that day and said court was cancelled, after knowing for a week. I lost 2 hotel night stays and a tank of gas. She did that on purpose to cause me more loss and inconvenience. I am now suing the firm for malpractice."
2,"Rooms at LVH are inexpensive, additional amenities are very much the opposite (wireless is thirteen dollars a day, a single quart of Crystal Geyser is four), rooms are clean and pleasant, et cetera, you can read about that stuff in any of these reviews. \n\nMore important than any of that is the sheer amount of nipple slippage going on outside. If you are lucky enough to have a room facing the pool, park yourself in front of a giant picture window 'round happy hour and check out the free boob show*. \n\nThree stars!\n\n*or maybe show a little restraint and don't act like a huge creep/me. Whatever floats your boat."
2,"I learned about this place from here, Yelp. I live close to that place and pass by it everyday and have never noticed it. It used to be a donut store / bakery before this though and it looks like they left all of the fixtures behind from the previous owners and they sort of use them here. I walked it and there was literally one table in there and it looked like it was donated from someone's backyard and not only was there only one table but it seemed like people working there or friends/family of the people working there were taking that space up. \n\nThe place was fairly messy quite honestly. It looked like someones home kitchen if they were throwing a party on 4th of July. If you look behind the counter, you see a bunch of bowls everywhere, the dude that was preparing my order was looking for the scoop spoon everywhere found it on the counter and washed it, rather, rinsed it off before he scooped the macaroni into my box, plus it took me about 5 minutes before he even took my order and there was only one person before me and on top of that, one of the people that was sitting at that table kept going back behind the counter to get stuff and never even acknowledged me.\n\nI finally get to the counter to make my order. I ordered the Chicken Katsu. That's pretty much what I judge a Hawaiian restaurant by, how good their Chicken Katsu is. The guy that took my order prepared the rice and macaroni in my box while the cooks made the chicken... Then, almost as soon as he put the rice and mac in my box, he grabs his beer and steps outside for a moment to finish off his beer. I waited for about 10 minutes until the cook actually came out an bagged my food for me and called the guy back in to ring me up.\n\nThe first thing the guy says \""I don't care how busy it gets, if it's time for a beer, I need my beer\"". This was at about 4pm. He was cool the whole time though. It's not like he was belligerent or not courteous, but not exactly what I would consider good service. Still, I got no beef with that guy or that place. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Katsu lunch plate and it's probably some of the best Chicken Katsu I've had. Definitely better than what L&L has to offer, but nothing makes me want to go back there. If someone were to bring me food from there I would enjoy it but to go there and just see the place that looks so run down and the wait just doesn't seem worth it."
4,"great salon!!\nEmily Ward was my hair dresser, I did a haircut and hair color, the color is very good without chemicals. Emily was very nice and she did exactlly what I wanted."
1,"Not my cup of tea. \n\nI went in with some friends for an early dinner. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived and it's seat yourself so we grabbed a table and sat down. Our waitress was super friendly but the food just didn't do it or me. \n\nI'm not an ice tea drinker (I know...I know) so I can't comment on that but here goes:\n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs which come topped with chicken and bacon. How could you mess that up??? Well, the presentation was just bad. It looked like they just threw the eggs and toppings on the plate. To make matters worse, the flavors just were not good. It was like the chicken came out a can...ugh! No thank you.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I knew based on previous reviews, to ask for my syrup on the side...to avoid syrupy chicken. But let's just say, again that the textures and flavors were a huge miss. I expected the waffle to be light and fluffy...nope. Instead it was dry and crumbled with each bite. That's not a good thing...the saving grace was the tabasco butter. Now, that was yummy.\n\nThe chicken was not crispy and I wasn't a fan of the skin...See I am not one of those girls that takes the skin off and only eats the chicken meat...Nooooo....normally I eat it all. But not here...the skin nor the chicken were good for me. \n\nSo pretty much Sweet Tea's just wasn't for me."
0,Granted it is a Sunday morning but the drive thru has to be the slowest I have ever encountered!! Wow!! I had a choice of 3 locations to go to from where I was. I guess I didn't choose wisely!! Should have read the reviews first I guess. I was in the drive thru line from start to finish 15 minutes maybe even more. The person at the window was very nice though.
3,"I checked this place out after a bike ride with a friend and really, really enjoyed it! It's casual - order your food first and then they bring it to you. It's a really cute, light, easy place. I described it as the Chipotle of Breakfast. \n\nI had the Sante Fe Eggs Benedict (with jalapeno corn bread - so yummy!) I think my arteries hardened slightly in the midst of digesting but it was worth it. My friend's plate looked equally scrumptious. You're not going to get any fancy coffee there (I was hankering for a latte) but still had a good cup of normal joe. \n\nThe staff was nice and pleasant and I really enjoyed the patrons as well - we chatted with quite a few and it just seemed like a really nice upbeat place. If I'm on that end of town again for breakfast - I would definitely go back!"
2,"Went here for AZ restaurant week with a few friends. All of us had been wanting to try this place, but just hadn't gotten around to it yet. I really wanted to like this place, and I did like it, but it didn't live up to my expectations or the hype. Ambiance is good, they have a nice patio, however we were seated near the kitchen and it was kind of loud. Service was OK, but when I'm dining at a place like House of Tricks, service is one of those things that I expect to be excellent. \n\nThe food was pretty good, but again a little underwhelming for the price, even at restaurant week discounts. The appetizer we enjoyed the most was the pork belly, it was really great. But also tiny/underportioned. The bacon frosting cinnamon roll was something that brought us to this place, but it was pretty bad. The roll was burnt, crusty, hard, not tasty at all.  Cocktails were pretty good.\n\nAll in all, it was a fine meal. Nothing was really awful (except maybe the cinnamon roll dessert). For this price, I'd suggest you keep looking. The valley has much better to offer. But if you're stuck on Mill Ave and want a place not crowded with frat boys and sorority sisters, this might be your best option."
1,Not a fan.  The food was dry and bland.\n\nNot sure how someone could make a bland burger.  Just add salt and pepper.\n\nToo pricey for such limited return as well. \n\nToo many other great places in the area to come back here.
1,"In a few words: Great food, terrible service.\nI have been to Ventano three times now.  They have a lovely wine list, and all the food I or anyone in my party has ordered was delicious.  I especially recommend the Spiedini, which is an impossibly amazing \""What if they mated?\"" love child of mozzerella sticks and chicken tenders.  NOMNOMNOM.\nThe problem, and the reason I will not be going back, is the service.  It is simply incompetent.  The first time I went, we were not seated for 20 minutes, and later found out that the hostess completely forgot about us, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.  During one visit, we had a waiter who would rather talk to other waiters than pay any attention to us, and during another, we had two waiters who were taking duplicate orders for the first half of our meal, and then could not attract the attention of either during the second half, short of actually waving our arms in the air.\nIn addition to the incompetent staff, this restaurant employs the most annoying technology I have ever seen- they bring a portable credit card machine to your table and make you CHECK YOURSELF OUT.  I have never seen anything so tacky at a supposedly nice restaurant.  You have to swipe your own credit card like you were at Subway, then select your tip from the choices of \""18%,\"" \""20%,\"" or \""other.\""  Needless to say, I chose \""other.\""  I should have chosen ZERO.\nGet it together, Ventano.  Your food is too good to have such terrible waitstaff and a fast-food check-out.  Let me know when you fix it and I'll be back."
0,"Another Yogurtland that failed in training their workers. The story is there is a new yogurtland app. After seeing the sign I Downloaded it to get pt's on my phone. When I came back to get my point... The girl at the cashier changed from when we first came in.\n In the beginning it was all smiles & hellos....Colorful yogurtland rainbows\n***then later when we had an issue... all the attitude came out. When i asked her for a receipt. She lied and said that we didn't ask for it. \n\nWhen it turned out my hubsss had it in his pocket!! niceeee....\n\nThen they brought their Assistant manager later who also lied to us. Saying we can get our return later online. \""OHhhhhh hrmmm did they train me? I think you can click that link\"" Yeah, that's for filling out a survey totally unrelated. \nThe whole staff here gets a bravoooo for all that acting. \n\nIt really ruined the whole experience. With such noobs,  I'm not sure if i ever want to step foot in a Yogurtland again."
2,"I had the chicken sandwich here. I thought it was very good and the price was very fair. I was open to eating just about anything on the menu, but being so close to the university sometimes can be pricy. So I was mainly there snooping.\nThe dining area was very clean and the staff was attentive, not annoyingly so. It was quick too and the price was right $3.50.."
0,"I worked about 20 yards away from Tony's for about a year, so I've experienced a lot of what they have to offer.  I am writing this review because I am utterly shocked that anybody would rate this above 1 or 2 stars.  \n\nThey don't bother to turn on the lights in the back of the store most days.  The canned foods in the grocery area are dusty.  I ate here probably half a dozen times, and each time the sandwich had an odd whang to it that I can't identify.  It wasn't *bad* per se, but I quickly learned to spend another 2 dollars for Subway down the street.\n\nI ended up coming here for sodas and candy because it was so close to where I worked, until I caught on that I had to check the expiration date on all the items.  I am sure that the expired sodas and candy bars weren't dangerous, but I sure got a nasty tasing one from time to time.\n\nAlso, the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up.  \n\nIt's an OK stop if you're hard up for cash and have a hankering for a sandwich with a weird taste, and don't mind rummaging through foodstuffs to find fresh items.  But certainly never go out of your way to eat here."
1,"2.5/5 - Buffalo Chicken Hoagie: Good flavor, nice texture with the potato fries, big, kinda dry.\n1.0/5 - Bacon Cheeseburger: Cooked well done (ordered rare), bacon bits, shaved iceburg lettuce.  Bread was better.\n2.0/5 - Breadsticks.\n\nThe last several times I've ordered for delivery, it's been around a half hour late.  The food doesn't arrive hot and fresh, either.  And this is ordering at off-peak hours (2pm)."

1,"When Trusty Pal Mikey mentioned that this place had won Best Fish in Chips in the Valley at some point in the recent past, it was time to jump into the car and head on downtown for sustenance. \n\nArriving at the restaurant was kind of anti-climatic as on a Monday night during football there didn't seem to be a lot going on (except for a pretty cool DirecTV trailer showing the game which was a nice touch)\n\nThere were several tables of mostly intoxicated patrons, to be expected of a bar/pub during a sporting event but the guy sitting ON the table next to ours stretched out in Cincinnati Bengals gear should probably have been asked to call it a night.\n\nIt took a while to get a server to clean some unidentified stickiness off of our table, bring menus and take a drink order and about then the table next to ours got LOUDER w/the addition of an off-duty server (confirmed by asking our server) wearing a Rose & Crown shirt and another woman identified as \""the girlfriend of one of the owners.\""\n\nLoud, rowdy, employees enthusiastically dropping F-bombs didn't make for the best dining atmosphere.  Fail there.\n\nThen the starters arrived...The Sausage roll was mostly cold, the puff pastry which should have been light and flakey was gooey and undercooked although the pickle relish condiment was delicious.\n\nThe Scotch egg was served cold (the server confirmed this was as intended) which seemed odd to me as I've always had them hot (the British version), the flavor was good but the texture of cold sausage just didn't work for me (this is a personal preference not a knock on their version).\n\nThe Fish & Chips Main arrived and I must say, the Chips were superb, well cooked and just the right size.  Then things went a bit pear shaped.  The fish, while piping hot was EXTREMELY greasy and devoid of seasoning.  Luckily the homemade tartar sauce was tasty (though the size of the pickles prevented dipping). \n\nI LOVE a good order of Fish and Chips but was sadly underwhelmed by the offering here and was forced to grab something on the way home to satisfy my hunger.\n\n(note:  The table next to us was joined by a patrons Dalmatian and even though we were on the patio, there are just some places that just aren't appropriate for the little furry people.  He was nice enough to lick my leg a few times during dinner though)  \n\nFor future fish & chips fixes I will save the 40mile round trip and get it closer to home, very sad that this wasn't as good as i'd hoped it would be."
1,"To start, the bathrooms are DISGUSTING, with that being said I would never EAT anything here again.  This is a neighborhood bar for me.  I've been in here a handful of times, the crowd is never rowdy or out of control.  The bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere. I normally only drink Coor Light drafts which are 2.75!!! that's a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars.  I have had the wings in the past, before I saw what a disaster the bathrooms were.  They fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh. \n\nThe patrons are a older work crowd, not too may youngsters here.  \nI have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend."
2,"To reiterate my charming companion, and her meager-looking Jamieson...\n\nCame here on a rainy Wednesday @ 6ish. The crowd was a mix of tourists and business folk. I suspect this place is more happening on the week-end. They might want to try a happy-hour drinks/food menu to draw in a more hip, local crowd during off-times.\n\nDo NOT order the \""popcorn\"" sweetbreads. I was expecting substantial nuggets of hot, crispy-coated offal with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. What I got was luke-warm, flour-dusted bits of sweetbreads, with some droplets of sauce, drowning in too-large cuts of green onion as garnish... I expect to impart an Asian feeling? Mission not accomplished.\n\nThe bartender, after giving great service the whole evening, asked what I had thought of them, and promptly took them off my bill after she received a resounding, \""Meh?\"", even though I had ordered nothing else but tap water.\n\nIn conclusion... Great service, good fancy-business ambiance, probably happening on the weekend, but don't use it as an opportunity to round out your Facebook Food List Challenge.\n\nPS. I really want to give this place 2 1/2 stars, but since there's no option it gets 3 'cause I'm nice :)"
3,"First off: I came in with HUGE expectations! Hubert was my fav on Top Chef Masters and could NOT wait to eat here while in Vegas!\n\nWe decided to go all out and get everything we wanted so we did the Liquid Nitrogen table-side cocktails. I recommend do this is once- it is an experience and fun to have a sorbet-ish cocktail. \n\nWe had a delicious flatbread, snails, ceviche (Mmm ceviche was AMAZING!) and \""shower\"" mac'n'cheese which was sadly disappointing.\n\nWe went for the Fleur Burger with truffles and foie gras. THIS is why I wanted to go here- we couldn't get the $5000 burger so this was just as extravagant...\n\nAND I was disappointed. It was too much and meh at the same time. Sad day.\n\nMoving on the desserts were phenomenal!!!! We tried the brownie pops AND cheesecake- the cheesecake was divine. Drool- so good.\n\nGreat date place- expensive but good. Avoid the burger and get all the delicious small plates and desserts!"
3,"I went here for lunch. It wasn't busy at all. We sat down and we decided to do the lunch special which was on the pricey side. The rib eye was nicely sliced and looked fresh. The broth was on the bland side, but the sauce makes up for it.\n\nThe service was great! Although, it was just us in the restaurant, but still, very attentive. Would I try it again, sure."
3,We came here for happy hour and it was great. Service was quick and and I like the location! No veggie items but that is to be expected at a cajun place.
4,"Just had the \""death wobble\"" fixed on my jeep. All staff was super knowledgeable, extremely courteous and the price for the new part and labor was most reasonable. I will definitely be back with any other vehicles. \n\nOverall, great prompt service, great prices, and awesome staff. Will be back for sure.\n\nThanks ATD!!"
3,"We visited while traveling through the state.   We started off with the Shrimp Napoli which was delicious.  For our meal, I ordered the Veal Scaloppini, which sadly was a bit disappointing.  The sauce and accompaniments were great, but the veal was incredible overcooked.  My husband enjoyed his Meatball and Pepperoni Manicotti, albeit a bit rich for him.  So, basically the food was ok.  \n\nCustomer service was decent, and the staff was fairly pleasant and upbeat.  \n\nIf I were to visit again, I'd stick with the Shrimp Napoli, house salad, and a glass of wine."
0,"Extremely poor. \n\nTiny (& I mean minuscule) portions and served up cold and poorly presented...and clearly aged & frozen produce used to add insult to injury.\n\nThis is the third time I've eaten at Bluerapa over the past year and each time it's been worse than the previous. \n\nAfter this episode I spoke to the manageress and was offered a 50% off next time, but to be honest I was so appalled by this experience that that's us done with this place. \n\nOverpriced and under delivered."
4,Love this place! Next to great restaurants and artistic decor inside! See Rachelle! She's an amazing colorist! They carry great products like O&M and I can always count on Rachelle to give me good tips for keeping my hair healthy!!!
0,"Owner should thank his lucky stars I'm not posting a picture of my completely raw chicken I was served last night. I dont mean a little undercooked, I mean as raw as when they bought it! After the manager agreed to fix my order I got it \""to go\"" (because all my friends were done eating) and this time they made sure they weren't raw by burning them to a crisp and drenching them in so much sauce it was sickening to look at. I threw them away. Manager comped my meal only, and looked more frustrated than sympathetic. I suppose this is an error with the chef,  and not so much the rest of the staff."
1,"I felt this restaurant was very overpriced for what you got.  The restaurant itself is very old and not in a classic way.  Furniture was cheap and tables pushed very close to one another.  The food was just alright, but not worth the price.  I won't be coming back here again which is too bad, because I live right down the street."
3,"I recently ate here for our anniversary and for a night with friends. I have to say, the quality and attention to sushi was top notch! I tried the uni sushi, Salmon sashimi, the sea bass tartar, happy maki and spicy scallop hand roll. Btw the uni was amazing! \n\nIt was amazing, hats off to the chef. \n\nAlthough the service was ok, and the food good, be aware they don't seem to be organised so you may need to wait to eat. I'm not sure if this is on purpose, but it gets awkward if everyone has a dish and one person has been waiting for over an hour for ebi sushi and salmon sushi.\n\nAlso note, get reservations! Or for the best spot, eat at the bar and ask the chef to make you anything he feels like for the best experience!"
0,"My brother, BFF, boyfriend and myself decided to check this bar out last night. It was big and bright with nice colorful decor. We wanted to play pool and to our surprise it was only 75 cents! That's hard to find in decent bars. So my brother and boyfriend sit at the bar while my BFF and I set up the pool table. My brother then walks up to me and says the bartender wants to see our IDs. So I took my BFF and my IDs over to the bar and this pathetic excuse of a bartender (blonde with fake chesticles) keeps walking pass me and kept talking to the other customers and paid no mind to us. Not once, but three times she walks pass. My brother extends both IDs so she can see it. Finally she comes up to us and asks what I would like to drink. I said nothing you wanted to see our IDs right? And she goes, \""Oh yeah.\"" Takes a glimpse, and basically shoves it back. Rude, much? Her attitude was so horrid, my brother and boyfriend left the bar area so they didn't have to deal with her attitude. By the way blondie, if you're working for tips, next time, you should be nice to EVERYONE. Because our group was the richest people at the bar at the time and you didn't get a tip from us. You were totally barking up the wrong tree.\n\nwhy one star? POOR SERVICE FROM BLONDIE!"

3,"Took a couple out of town friends to the new Pamela's location on a Monday morning. Our server was cheerful and friendly, and refilled drinks as if he were reading your mind.

Probably the best experience I've had at any Pamela's so far!\n\nMy only peeve with Pamela's is their bacon. It's not that good. It's too thin and skimpy and tastes like that microwaveable, pre-cooked bacon you get at the grocery store.

2,"Visited Pappadeaux's on a Friday around 8pm and there was no wait so we quickly ordered drinks and began looking at the menus.  We munched on bread while we waited for our dinner.  I ordered the Seafood Platter ($25) while my friend ordered a pasta and seafood dish ($30).  Our waiter was Brian and he was a friendly guy. He appeared to be new as he had to see the menu to know what sides and such we would receive.  The blue lump crab cake was good, but not as good as I remembered. All the food seemed to taste the same.  I also had the spaghetti squash and it was fairly bland. My friend devoured her pasta and seafood dish, but it wasn't much food for the price."
4,"Does New York City know about Owen's?\n\nOwen's is Charlotte's hidden gem. Seriously, it's almost impossible to find. If you're having trouble, go to Polished in South End.

If you can't decide, you can always get the \""lottery\"" bagel. It's $6.50 for a bagel sandwich of the staff member's choice with chips and a fountain drink. I've never had a bad one yet!\n\nA few insider tips...\nFirst off, get your bagel steamed instead of toasted. I know, it's crazy, but it's AMAZING.\nSecond, at Owen's a bagel with everything on it isn't called an ET or an everything bagel, but a \""combo\"" bagel.\n\nOne combo, steamed, with butter, please!"
4,It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for. \n\nIf bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
2,"I'm sorry, but they just don't serve the 2nd best pizza in Phoenix.  Not even close.  It's a cute little place & the food was a-ok, but nothing special.  I went with my husband and we split the antipasto with mozzarella and a margarita pizza.  It was good...don't get me wrong, but I don't think we'll be back.  I don't have anything too memorable to share about the food.  The beer selection isn't great either.  It's a cute place and I hope they do well because I love local and I love Central Phoenix - but we're going to give it some time until we go back."

1,"The D\u00eda de los Muertos event at the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) was fantastic this year; however, the food catered by this company was certainly not \""fabulous.\"" The food was average at best and certainly overpriced for the quality. \n\nThe catered menu for the DBG celebration consisted of a fairly limited menu of chips & salsa, and a choice of either Machaca Tacos (shredded beef) or Fish Tacos. There may have been one salad option, too. \n\nThe chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious, but seemed a little overpriced at $4.50 for a small serving. The Machaca Taco plate came with a side of rice and refried black beans for $13.95. The shredded beef was tender and had good flavor, but the rice was cold and the refried beans were dried out and lacking flavor. Also, the Horchata tasted like sweet milk and was seriously lacking in spice - who forgot the cinnamon?! \n\nBesides the lackluster food, I was also disappointed by the lack of professionalism and attitude of the catering crew. This was a cool event to cater, but they all looked bored. \n\nBased on this experience trying a meal catered by FF and interacting with their staff, I would not hire them in the future."
2,"I've been to Oregano's a half dozen times in the last year and have had some mixed results, hence the 3 stars.\n\n Two weeks ago I took a buddy of mine from out out town. We started off with the Guaca Tony, which is an Italian guacamole, made with basil, roasted garlic and avocado, surrounded with pizza crust 'chips. They give you a heaping mound of Guacamole, but the pizza crust tasted like pure salt, which definitely ruined that appetizer. We shared a pizza which was definitely way too salty as well.\n\nI don't know if the cook accidently knocked over a large shaker of salt in the pizza batter and didn't want to get fired by management for throwing the profits in the garbage. But this was the first time I didn't enjoy my meal at Oregano's.\n\nThe staff is ALWAYS uber friendly and helpful. But a major downer for me is the lack of adequate facilities based on the size of the restaurant which means you need to plan well and be prepared to wait."
1,Their chicken fingers were the worst I have had in years. And they are a bit pricey too.
4,"This place is soooo much fun.  You can take just yourself or bring a huge crowd and you won't be dissatisfied.  The animals are beautiful and they have a great selection of animals from different locations around the world.  The aquarium is beautiful and you can even pet the sting rays!!  This place is very kid friendly.  Open year round with various hours.  Only closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's."
1,"This place is super-overrated; it is not the \""best buffet in Vegas.\"" Sure, the variety is amazing, but the quality is merely average, and none of the food was extraordinarily delectable. I'd rather have just one ethnic food type and have them focus on it being extremely delicious. As the adage goes, quality over quantity. \n\nThis is not a memorable experience. In contrast, I still remember my meal at the Bellagio buffet from a couple years back. \n\nIt does have one redeeming quality, however: the dessert section."
3,"I've been wanting to go here for a while but just never have.  At 67 degrees, everyone was remarking what a fab day it was.  So off to have an early dinner since they close at 530.  It's very serene & also quiet with only 2 tables of customers at 4pm.  The food is pretty good for what you'd expect, bar food @ a golf course.  The menu's simple.  We tried the philly cheese steak with a side of fruit, frits & fries (chix finger w BBQ & ranch sce), and a salmon salad.   They have breakfast, too as well as a full bar."
3,"Love it! Finally a nice place to hang out in the Foothills, only minutes from my home! The coffee and prices are good, and the atmosphere is relaxing. Not too loud, but also not too quiet. We played mancala, which is one of the small collection of games they provide. I only wish that it was open in the evenings! (Their summer hours close at 5pm.)\n\nOverall, I can definitely see myself coming back here to chat with friends or to get some work done!"
1,"Nothing more than a standard restaurant with a few good beers.  \n\nI really wouldn't consider this place a gastro-pub as you might know or expect.   Yes, there are 1 or 2 interesting menu items such as the bone marrow - but one or two interesting selections makes you a gastro-pub wanna-be.  \n\nI guess I just had sub-par service and really should give it another try.  But, with so many good places to choose from in Vegas, it will be hard for me to give it a second chance."
3,"If youre looking for fantastic service and great food then this is the place. I was with a group of 23 celebrating a 21st bday. We had one server with an assistant to help her & they didnt miss a beat! I never went empty on my drink and she checked in on us efficiently.\n\nThe decor was cute, lots of pigs and cows. They had this cute whimsical looking pig on an 18\""x18\"" glass connected to eachother as wall seperators.\n\nWe started with appetizers: Deep Fried Pickles-fried deliciousness; Redneck poppers-pulled bbq pork w/cheddar cheese formed in a ball & deep fried, they were amazing & I didnt want to share! Lobster Rolls-served on mini hot dog style buns, filled with a lobster filling-it was okay but couldnt taste the lobster, you got 2 mini's for $14, Lobster Mac-n-Cheese was incredible & I would order a full size order for myself! The Gold Standard burger was cooked to perfection and you cant go wrong with bacon on it! We passed around a few different milkshakes and they were very good.\n\nMy only suggestion to them was to offer snack size plates of absolutely everything on the menu because I couldnt decide which yumminess to try!! I will definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas!"
1,Pool service is terrible. Took 30 plus minutes for drink orders. We also went to Centro Lounge for dinner and service was ALSO slow! Good lord
4,"After having HORRIBLE experiences with several haircolorist in Scottsdale - and having to return to LA, CA to have it corrected several times - I got lucky and found Ray Issa at the Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort.  He nailed my hair color and didn't charge me an arm and a leg!  He is also super sweet!  So excited to have found him!"
4,This place has great sushi for a good price. Great selection of wine. Best crab rangoons anywhere! I recommend the hory fook roll.
4,"I love Consol.  It is hands down the best place in Pittsburgh to see a sporting event.  There is literally not a bad seat in this place.  I have been here for concerts, football games, and hockey games, and I have never had my vision hindered by anything.  \n\nAlso, they have some great food at this place.  Burgatory has recently just opened up a burger stand inside, and that alone makes me want to come see a Penguin game just so I can enjoy a burger.  The only down side is that the food here is pretty pricey, but what do you expect.  All the food is fantastic thought.  Honestly, it amazes me to say this but the BBQ Chicken Nachos (though nine dollars) are the best dang nachos I have ever had.\n\nSeriously though, I would go to Consol just to hang out.  There would not even need to be an event going on for me to find myself having a good time and eating good food.  With that being said, if you have not been here to see a show or a sporting event, you should probably get off Yelp and go buy some tickets for something right now.  You will not be disappointed,"
4,"Our meal here was one of the best of my life.  Hubby and I chose Jasmine because of it's location facing the water of the Bellagio fountains.  It didn't dissapoint.\n We got a great table in front of the windows to watch the water show up close while the music played quietly overhead.  It was romantic!\nWe ordered lots of food.  The best being the chillian sea bass which was the best fish I've ever had!!!  I mean, it was amazing, you have to taste it. Also, we got dumplings, fried rice, and pepper beef.  All were great.\nThe service was as good as any prime steak house you can go to. Attentive and friendly.  The food was warm and flavorful, and the only thing I wish is that Jasmine was closer to home so I could eat here more often."
2,"Wow - I am super sleepy! That is a frequent occurrence when I eat at a Filly B's. It must be the magical combination of tortilla, meat and grease or perhaps a secret ingredient that makes me feel this way - but within 20 minutes I am ready for a nap. It is a struggle when I go for lunch, but just write the day off if I get a breakfast burrito in the morning!\n\nThis location is new, replacing Moe's a few months ago. The store is clean and the staff friendly. The food arrives quickly. I think it is a good portion for the price. I get a number 2 (taco & burrito combo) and I have never been able to finish it. The chips and salsa are free (I go with the tomatillo) and drink refills are free.  The rating would be a little higher perhaps, if not for the 60 cent surcharge for using your debit card.\n\nIf you are having trouble sleeping, come get a burrito here - it isn't just me. I have taken live sample surveys of people I know and they all are sleepy after eating Filbertos. Sweet dreams!"
0,"Just the worst for travel. Shuttle waiting more than hr at the airport until the whole shuttle was full (I had been told they left ever 15 min), then shuttle was more than 20 min late picking back up for return trip. Customer service was unhelpful and rude. So much extra stress on travel day; it's way overpriced for level of service. Stay away."
2,"It was my first time going...Food trucks were the highlight for me.  Any and everyone is welcome and it clearly showed.  Felt a lot like Venice Beach with art and eclectic mixed in downtown LV.  One character who looked like he couldn't weigh 100 lbs wet walking around in camouflage pants with a skeleton body suit underneath who walks around and starts pop locking in the street...LOL.  We'll check it out again because we saw some cool stuff.  It was great to see such a huge, peaceful gathering.  Be prepared for mental stimulation."
4,Chicken and waffles were excellent. Perfect on a cold night.
0,"I ordered a spinach, goat cheese and sundried tomatoe omelet. It was horrible! The cheese was not inside, but on top - cold and unmelted. The omelet was actually more of a fritatta as it was brown all over from being overcooked. I mentioned this to the employee who brought the dish to my table, but my complaint went ignored. Even after eating only one bite of the omelet - it was cold on top of everything else - no one seemed to care. After spending $13 for an omelet and glass of milk, you'd think they'd jump through hoops to make people happy given their prices. Never again. This was my second visit and I was unhappy after my first. Hoping the first visit was a fluke, I gave this restaurant a second chance. Big mistake on my part.\n\nThe employees were very friendly when I ordered, but this isn't enough to make up for the lack of concern  or care over my displeasure. The food is not good and the prices are way too high for what you get."
1,Visited St Joseph's this Christmas Eve and I was pretty disappointed. I think I had built it up to be something pretty amazing in my mind and when I finally went I was pretty disappointed with the Christmas Eve mass. The actual church was gorgeous of course but I expected more from the mass.
1,***As an update the Manager has contacted me and apologized for not following through on the night of the incident it sounds as if there was a little miscommunication with some of the staff. He has offered to take care of us if we come back. We will be going back to see if they make things right.***
1,We had dinner there today. Very poor service. They didn't answer when we pushed the order button. The drive through was out of order. I went into the kitchen to make an order. We probably won't be back. So sad cause we like Sonic.
4,"Fantastic, fresh food at reasonable prices in a casual setting.  Creative menu and food ~ loved the prime rib and fresh veggies. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was outstanding as was chocolate mousse.  Wonderful chef and incredibly personable staff with outstanding customer service.  Truly a fun little place!!"
4,"I went to Jim in July while I was training for a KungFu competition. I was so tight from 2 months of constant training. After having Jim work on me, I felt so much looser and able to move freely. Jim is great! I can't speak more highly of any massage professional. I feel comfortable and I walk away feeling so much better and stronger. He is really a fantastic massage therapist."
4,"I waited this long to see this show because I thought it wound be something like Mama Mia-a story built around great songs where the plot and the characters are under-developed but you still  think you had a great time because you were familiar to the melodies.  \n\nJersey Boys was NOT like this at all.  It had a great plot (being that it was the story of the Franki Valli and the Four Seasons), and awesome character development, and of course the songs!   I saw it on a Saturday, 6:30PM show, and thought the guy who played Franki Valli was awesome.  \n\nI do have a couple of comments about seeing a musical in Vegas.  This is my first \""Vegas\"" musical and what I did enjoy was I could bring my drink into the theater- awesome.  But what I did notice was that the ushers let late arriver in any time throughout the show.  All the plays and musicals I've been too, they usually wait after a song or scene and escort everyone at the same time. Totally bugger.  Also the cost was a little higher than I what I'm used to paying.  There was a Vegas Resident discount of $50 off Orchestra seating, but it still came out to $125/seat.  Anyway, I still enjoyed the show and would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,"Parking sucks in this area but there are so many great food options at this corner now it is hard to pass up.  They have free valet now which helps tremendously on this side of the corner.  I love NYPD pizza and now they have a great gluten free pizza option that is the best I have ever had.  I am not 100\"" gluten free but stay away as much as possible and now I can have pizza more often since they have a great gluten free one.  They have great wings here too and if you like white pizza it is also one of my favorites.  I am usually a pepperoni jalapeno kind of dude and you cant go wrong with that either.  This location is nice new clean and very casual like the rest of NYPD locations.  They have a small casual bar, and you can order in line or sit down and get service."
4,"This morning there was a line out the front door and there's a reason for that: everything is really good. There are a few tables but mainly the shop is set up for buying pastries, quiche, bread and sandwiches to take away. \n\nThey have a building permit in the window, which is good because it means they are expanding, and I overheard someone behind the counter say that they are maybe opening on Sundays. The neighborhood, right on the line between central and upper Lawrenceville, is fast becoming the most vibrant area of Pittsburgh so it's easy to see why this place is thriving."
3,"I originally wanted to do brunch at Bouchon but they are closed on Mondays for brunch. BOO! \nWe ended up wondering around for a while and ended up here. (Lots of the nicer restaurants are not open at 11am on Mondays.) \n\nSitting \""outside\"" in the Canal area at the Venetian is beautiful, the people watching and the performers are fun too.  \n\nTo start off they gave us this bread but it was burnt?? The waiter tells us that \""the crust is suppose to be that way.\"" hmmm?? okay? I didn't get it, it tasted like burnt bread to me. \n\nWe ordered an Insalate- grilled radicchio with smoked mozzarella. This was good the cheese was baked on top with the crispy radicchio at the bottom. Yummy!\n\nAs the main entrees we had the Gemelli - house sausage and broccoli rabe. I love the gemelli noodles they were cooked perfectly, texture was just right and they had a unique shape. The other dish was the Bavette Cacio e Pepe- black pepper and percorino. A very simple dish however, full a flavor you can really taste the noodles but it was a salty. \n\nThe portions seem small when you look at them compared to how much pasta you get at other restaurants but, I was stuffed by the end of lunch. And you should be with a $50 lunch tab. \n\nI wonder how B&B would be??? (A lot more expensive, I know that much) :P"
1,"Nothing spectacular on the menu, the gas station location is a royal pain (parking especially), and they lack some basic Mexican food items on the menu.  About the only good thing I can say is that the daily specials are often a screaming deal, such as a bean burrito for $1 (no cheese though, and they wouldn't let me add cheese, even at a nominal cost)."
2,"The service was great here and it was decent French-esque food. The inside is dark and candlelit. Try to get a patio seat if possible. We weren't able to. \n\nFirst, the good: omg the baked goat cheese. OMG THE GOAT CHEESE. The cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. It was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. It was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. Unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. \n\nWe also had the warm brie. I love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. Unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. I ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. \n\nI had the half portion of mussels and the frites. I didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. I dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. All overcooked and shriveled. Even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and I didn't eat many of them. The mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. \n\nMon Ami Gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. I didn't try it, so I can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. \n\nWe were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served Profiteroles with sparkler candles. They were festive, but not incredibly delicious. Then again, I always have high expectations for French pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica Eiffel Tower on the Vegas strip. However, it was pricey enough to expect better food than we got. \n\nMy advice? Come and gorge on cheese, bread, and wine. Do as the French do and your meal will be more satisfying."
2,We had this a while ago. The pizza was average. It tasted better than costco but this is far from gourmet. This does not stack up with other 4 star ratings I've tasted in the past. \n\nThe price is most definitely more than a single dollar sign. It should be changed to $$.
0,"I will never do this again. This company is full of crooks. Do not waste your money. They will tell you everything to get in and sign up. But once you show up they have any excuse to deny you and can away with it because its in the fine print. So I would highly recommend you call your hotel and ask them questions. Even ask them if they heard of vegas hot spots. Your answer will be NO. No-one has heard about them. So please do some research before you are taking a loss like I did. All we had was the vegas one hour limo tour ride. Which turned out to be 1000$ ride because I was denied to all their venues and which was totally legal because it says in there fine print \""you can be denied for anything\"" which forfeits all your money. \nPlease don't waste your time. Call your hotel first they have insurance for these things and will tell you they've never heard of VHS AND TO NEVER BUY FROM 3RD PARTY IN VEGAS!!!"
2,"Service was good, coffee was great. But why did I only give it 3 stars??? food was just average ol breakfast food. Anything special about that average ol breakfast? They put a partial branch of rosemary in ur biscuit for garnishment. Thats it.... \n\nPlease note the food wasn't horrible.... it was edible but just very plain... nothing to get that excited about. If you are really hungry... prob not worth the wait time. Had higher expectations for as much hype as this place gets."
4,Love this place!  Please get a tempest machine.
2,"Nice location, cool view from the second floor.  Very simple, great for a sunday morning brunch.  Food is what you expect."
2,"Ok, to ALL the hipsters and east end snobs... everything can't be oh so trendy and veganese.  I say that with love, as I have my foothold in the trendy hipster scene as well.   Dunnings is GREAT.  Great Pittsburgh fare at reasonable prices, since when did $10 become too much for a burger?  I highly recommend anything fried or on a bun from Dunnings, you will not be disappointed.   When it comes to the dinner selections, I think it just depends on the cook in the kitchen.  The service is friendly, the decor is old school but well maintained.   I just get so frustrated with a lot of these comments because it seems like a lot of the yelpers excpect gold dust when they spend upwards of $5."
1,"Slow service, did not keep me in the loop.  I showed up for my 1030 apt time on Saturday for oil change, filter, inspection and tire balance and rotation.  It took 3 hours and then I had to confront the service advisor regarding the terribly slow service.  He apologized twice but did nothing else.  I then showed up home to find out they didn't rotate the tires.  Worst of all they didn't bother to explain why.  Tempe Acura, I won't be back, I knew there was a reason I didn't buy my Acura from there either."
3,"The Wynn is the overindulgent 1980's of strip casinos. It's gorgeous, and although you aren't snorting coke off of silver trays and shitting in gold gilded toilets, you are shitting in the nicest bathrooms on the strip. Wynn, a once prolific art collector, had opened an art gallery here in 2006. I LOVED THIS ART GALLERY, and I loved it because it fully displayed Steve Wynn's self-cock suckery, his utter love and admiration for himself... from the monumentally sized diamond encrusted portrait that Warhol did of him that he appropriately displayed next to his Rembrandt and Renoir, to the curation that was done by him via tape recorded anecdotes of his experiences buying art (which only vaguely related to the art itself), the Wynn is really Steve's swan song, a final over-the-top dedication to his dying self. The Wynn gallery has sadly closed, but rather than moving the gallery, Wynn has scattered its ashes around the casino, so while you're getting completely hammered and handing your money over to the Wynn Empire, you can still participate in the unabashed cock suckery that once was the Steven Wynn Art Gallery."
2,"visited Settebello yesterday for a to-go lunch order.  I went with the \""settebello\"" pizza ($13.50) - sausage, pancetta, mushrooms and pine nuts.  After ordering, walked down to Rocket Fizz to pick-up a few \""artisan\"" sodas.  Returned just in time to pick up pizza and go my way.\n\nI felt the pizza was undercooked - very slight charring on the top of the pizza crust,  The mozzarella was not melted, a boatload of pine nuts, yet very light on mushroom..  Still, the flavors were there - especially liked the sausage and the pancetta.  I'm hoping this is simply a \"" working out the kinks\"" situation yet I wonder since at the time I entered the restaurant, I only saw 3 customers - what happens when there are 30 customers ???\n\nI'll return"
0,"I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!"
4,Amazing ice cream. Spoke with owner and you can tell he has a passion for what he is doing. Small independent business thriving down the street from a Ben & Jerrys...love to see this. Pop in a gran a cone or chocolate covered bacon.
1,"I love the Two Hippies restaurants. And I love breakfast. So I REALLY wanted to love this place. BUT I just can't. Love the decor and the friendly service. And the menu looked awesome. The main menu item is breakfast in either a burrito or 'bowl' form. I ordered a bowl with the flour tortilla on the side expecting to get a burrito sized tortilla since that's what I would have gotten if ordering the burrito. Got me? Instead I got one taco sized tortilla.  And I do mean ONE TACO SIZED. Tiny. Really??!! Hmmmm. Should've ordered the burrito I guess. I was the only one in the restaurant and was sweating profusely as they did not have the AC running on this very hot day. Hmmmm... Guess they're trying to save money since it's dead in there??!!  After horking down my greasy mediocre plate, hurrying to escape the heat, I was left wondering what would make me come back here out of all the other wonderful choices we have in this area. And, sadly, the answer is nothing. I love supporting locally owned businesses and especially love all the hippies locations. Except for this one.  Bummer."
3,"One of my new favorite places!\nWe had a great dinner this evening.  Great service, good wine, fair prices, and my husband says it was one of the most perfectly cooked steaks he's ever had.  \n\nWe will definitely be back for more!"
4,"Amazing. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The shrimp cocktail was phenomenal and the scallops were perfect. Everyone in our party of 8 were very happy with their food. Pricey, but great atmosphere and service."
0,The owner was very RUDE. He screamed at me in front of customers because I asked him to fix the botch job he did on my nails. I went it for a full and the results looked horrible. I will never go back to nice nails because my nails weren't nice and neither was the customer service. Very unprofessional and I wish I didn't waste my $18 on that horrible place trust me don't go on there to waste your money. There are nicer nails places in tempe other than nice nails .
2,"Unfortunately, this fancy upscale steak joint is only A-OK for me and here's why:\n\n- head waiter took a full 5 min explaining the menu, only to have all but disappeared by the time we wanted to order dessert (had to flag down another waiter)\n\n- friends ordered the bone in ribeye, don't know about the marbling but it sure had a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed from it (and this is after the table side cutting/presentation)\n\n- my veal cutlets were pounded nice and thing, but not anywhere as tender as I would have expected\n\n- was told everything here was cooked a little more rare, which was misleading as my fiancee ordered her filet medium and it came out way overcooked, while my friends' ribeye was ordered med rare and it came out as just that\n\nOn the plus side, the sides were good and the assistant waiter was attentive in keeping our drinks filled. \n\nAt the end of the day though, this was just a bit of a let down by Vegas standards. The food and total experience here isn't any nicer than what I can, and have experienced, in Atlanta."
3,"I went here for the lunch special a few weeks ago. Half of the party was running late but they sat us anyways while we waited for them which I loved! \n\nThe meal was pretty good but what I liked the best was the service! I mentioned to my friend that I wished I had more pita of my appetizer which was the mezze plate which had a trio of dips. Then the next thing I knew a waiter (who wasn't ours!) brought over a basket with more pita bread! Definitely, go for the real awesome affordable lunch special and stay for the great service!"
4,"Took the family here.  I liked it.  Food took awhile but it was great.  Very nice people.  Family run.  I will go here again.   Plus, harbor freight is right next door !!\nUpdate - Have been back 3 times.  Every time was good."
2,"Redemption update! \n\nI must make this short but anytime a business redeems itself, it should be noted. \n\nI jumped up a star because I got the Pad See Ew to go, and it's great. FINALLY, spice \""level 1\"" is exactly what it should be. Also, they were quick, and so very friendly. \n\nThey've won me back as a go-to quick Thai joint for lunch, for the time being. \n\nCarry on, Sin City!"
3,"HELLO BREAKFAST! This place rocks socks off. There is always a wait but it is worth every minute. I chose what I was getting by simply looking around. Everything looked delicious. I need to go back for the pancakes or should I say crepecakes. Oh, and this place is PACKED yet the service is still good. Impressive if you ask me. \n\nSee ya there next Sunday!"
2,"Four or possibly four and  a half stars for the pizza quality, which is what you come here for anyway. Went in today at 5:30PM and dined on the patio- it was a gorgeous and breezy day, perfect for alfresco wine and pizza with my guy before he went off for the night shift.\n\nHad difficulty selecting a wine, server suggested a flight with three of their reserved wines in smaller pours. Sounded good, so we went for it and really enjoyed the presentation with the printed descriptions of each glass as a placemat. \nFirst wine was light and to my liking, second was my guy's favorite- fuller bodied and reminiscent of a cab, but the third was overwhelmingly acidic and we did not drink it.\n\nOrdered the Miala Bolognese pizza, romana style, at our server's suggestion (pork ragu, san marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, basil, caramelized onion, clabrian pepper)- very hearty with just a bit of spice, amazing cheese. Roman style crust was thin, crispy, and crackly, but still firm. The combination of tomatoes and cheese and crust was spectacular- made me very curious to try the margherita.\nUnfortunately the pork was on the dry side, but it was still surprisingly flavorful and did not detract from the other elements of the dish- kind of an impressive feat. Pork itself was also notably not fatty, getting it's flavor from quality.\n\nThen we got the bill- just under $20 for an artisan-style pizza with high quality toppings, not bad. But the wine flight, not listed on the menu or mentioned in price by the server who suggested it, was a surprisingly high $36, for 9 oz- only 6 of which we even drank. Had I known the flight was equivalent to three entire glasses of wine, I would have chosen from the menu and had one large glass of a wine I DID like rather than merely sips, and leaving an entire glass behind unfinished.\n\nIt wasn't until I pulled up the business page on Yelp that I noticed we were there smack-dab in the middle of happy hour- from 4:30 to 6:30, FYI, and yet no one we interacted with, from the bartender, to the host, to the server, ever bothered to mention it or drop off a menu of their featured specials.\nNot sure what is to blame for this oversight- would have much rather had the goat cheese appetizer and a single glass of wine with my pizza, had I known about the HH specials or the actual price of my wine flight. This should be mentioned when suggesting it to other diners in the future.\n\nTL;DR: Pizza is sublime and delicious, star subtracted for lack of transparency with pricing of wine flight suggested by server."
3,"Charred octopus salad, Duck Confit....  all good what can say.....  except for the killer bacon bread.  A must to go to."
2,"We rushed in Cornish Pasty (pronounced PASS-tee, not pastr-y or paste-y) before their last call and they still happily served us without a stink face. \n\n+1 for that!\n\nBut the food was pretty unmemorable and makes me question why I sped from the Grand Canyon to Scottsdale to make it in Cornish Pasty for a midnight snack... I felt a little insane to say the least.\n\nA Pasty reminds me of a larger, harder shell empanada with unique fillings..\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cornish-pasty-co-scottsdale?select=yarTeqHwg64O8odSZnxlfg#PDGAtDP0SGlc_mfxyxkHPw\n\nPeppered Steak filling - It was good, but lacked steak and the dipping peppercorn brandy cream sauce was super salty. I know, it was gravy-esque and gravy is supposed to be salty. But I did not enjoy the sauce on the side, while I felt like it was more of a mushroom pastry than anything. Not peppered steak.\n\nChicken & Pesto filling - Pesto, chicken and cheese. It was A-OK with marinara sauce on the side.\n\nWe also got the Scotch Egg appetizer, which was not bad, but I wish there was more flavor in the batter of the egg. And I felt like egg was just an overcooked hardboiled egg.\n\nYou know that old stereotype about how bad British food is? Uhhh. ha ha ha.. uhh..."
3,"The staff here are always cheerful and friendly, and while the items here are a bit pricey ($6 for a large smoothie or milkshake) you get your money's worth."
3,We had an enjoyable dinner last night before a play at the Orpheum. Ordered the pretzels and fondue because of previous posts.  They were really good!  Four of us had 3 different entrees and all were delicious. The salty caramel pudding is a perfect ending to the meal!  Servers gave helpful menu advice and good service and also had fun personalities!  All and all a fine experience.
2,"The scenery in this hotel is awesome-- especially their little New York suburb area. In this hotel there's a sandwich shop that is a good deal if you're looking for something cheap and filling to eat. You get sandwich, chips and drinks for about $10 or less. The rooms here are alright. Of course New York themed. This is one of the newer hotels when it comes to the MGM brands. There is also a walk-way to Excalibur and MGM Grand. I went on the roller coaster back in the day when it first opened. Not the most thrilling coaster, but it's something fun to do. I would suggest doing it at night. \nI've been to Rok Vegas in the hotel. It's a very small, bar/club. If you're a girl you get open bar until 11pm or so. Definitely not a place I would want to stay all night. Gambling here isn't the best. I feel like they don't have the best tables."
2,"Six guys without reservations on Cinco de Mayo FIght weekend looking for a good meal found this place pretty empty at around 7.30pm.  three of us joined up late and our waiter promptly took our drink orders and promptly forgot them.  after our drinks showed, we ordered the baked brie for around $11 and the crabcakes $9 i think.  the waiter was very pushy insisting that we orer multiples of every appetizer.  we ordered more beer.  my friend was so pissed that his was taking so long to show that he ordered two beers at once to make sure he would get at least one.\n  the filet mignon at $23 was reasonable but i asked for mine memdiim rare, and not a drop of blood came out of it.  the asparagus was cooked well, all six sprigs of it, and the mashed potatoes that were squeezed out of a pastry bag looked pretty but were too dry and lacked seasoning.\n  overall a bargain, but definitely felt like i was paying less for less, but then again, everything else was stocked, so it was better than starving.  we left and headed straight over to the SPEED ride to give our stomachs some excitement."
3,"I can't say it's going to swoop you into the streets of Shanghai but the $4.99 lunch specials here are blatant American highway robbery. For soup, rice, a choice of SOMETHING, cream cheese wontons, sit-down service and check-splitting, I commend this establishment for keeping its head above water. I shall return."
0,"I've been to many Safeways across the west coast, but this one has the worst customer service to date. The worst treatment is in the deli and with management, who accused me of lying when I expressed dissatisfaction with their wait times in the deli (they have a promise that your sandwich will be made within two or three minutes (I forget which) or it's free... Well that's a lie, instead they call you a liar when you call them on it and ask for your free sandwich). There is one cashier who is friendly, but for the most part, other than that everyone in that store ignores you and acts like you're wasting their time."
4,"This is one of the best 24 Hour Fitness locations. The reason is that is used to be an overly expensive gym and then 24 bought it.\n\nIt fits right with with many of the other things in Scottsdale - a lot of nice things that only a few get to enjoy. The 12/29/2007 review by wanugee N. is pretty much right on. \n\nThe only things I will add about this place:\n1) The locker room is huge.\n2) The location is in one of the nicest cities in the country.\n3) The pool has more than 3 lanes. I've never had to wait or share a lane at this location. Easily the biggest and most roomy pool I've seen at a 24 hour fitness yet. Enough room for swimmers, aerobics, and walkers all at the same time.\n\nSure they could update or replace some of their older equipment, but other than just to have new equipment it is not needed."
0,Horrible service! Unfriendly..... Worst subway in the East Valley...skips on ingredients. ...I highly DON RECCOMEND....PLEASE USE ANOTHER SUBWAY.....
4,This place is so awesome for date night.... Mondays are pasta night so for $7.00 you eat great... Ask for Hank he is the greatest waiter on the planet. They also always have drink specials . What more could you ask for
2,"Location was clean. Service was fast. Staff was friendly, and at unholy hour of 5:30 A.M, I think that deserves special recognition.  Got big, filling breakfast with coffee for $10+tip.  I have had more spectacular breakfasts but this was good, tasty, filling, and an improvement over last time I ate at this same location quite some years ago.  I'm fairly sure there are no hand-picked-by-the-chef truffles personally-massaged-with-organic-certified-prepubescent extremely virginal olive oil or the like on the premises, but see above: tasty, filling, clean, fast & friendly, $10, and an improvement from last, long-ago visit.  It's may not be \""destination-dining\"", but I'd hop in again."
4,"Met up with some locals who took me here as its their favorite restaurant.  Now its mine too!  Nice atmosphere and the menu goes from $$ to $$$ (interesting burgers up to filet mignon with chilies).  I had the sea bass cooked in a corn husk with asparagus.  It was fantastic.  The chilie poppers and guac as appetizers were also excellent.  The margaritas were top notch (both the basic and the next one up).  We took a short tour and saw a nice private room downstairs (wine bottle theme) that would hold 10 people and another two rooms that would hold more.  Excellent place for a corporate dinner.  All in all, I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."
0,"I joined Yelp just to give this dump a bad review. What horrible service. Ate there mid-afternoon during grand prix weekend. The restaurant was maybe half full, yet it still took a solid hour to get our less-than-mediocre burgers, which were dry and over compensated with crap toppings. Fries were cold & mushy and cooked in old/dirty oil . When issues were brought to managers attention (mostly related to time), she basically told us to F off. I only started feeling better about the situation after lingering around the entrance to point would-be-patrons away. If you read a positive review of this place, immediately write-off all other opinions of that individual."
4,This place has a great vibe and excellent service. It is a great place to go before enjoying a show at The Smith Center. \n\nThe guava margarita is super tasty. The chicken fajitas are delicious and big enough to share. My husband loved the burger. \n\nThe decor is unique and fun to look at. Can't wait to eat there again!
4,"So we wanted a really nice dinner one night.  Being from NYC I figured this would set me back about $300-400.  Well this place came highly recommended from some fellow Yelpers, so I decided to give it a whirl.\n\nI made a reservation from the hotel and was greeted by a friendly waiter who took our coats and gave me a special message.  It was a hand written letter from the Chef Jerome Ferrer, I've never been given anything like that to begin a meal, I was impressed.\n\nLooking at the menu I was a bit disappointed.  I have a mushroom allergy and could not eat most of the entrees, and I hate being a bother.  I settled on a dish called Morue which is fillet of cod, homemade tomato ketchup tapenade, potato espuma and peas emulsion.  Well I'll never say settled again....it was phenominal.\n\nWe were also treated to multiple appetizers including a cheese cigar served in a humidor, a lobster creme cappuchino, and a wonderful pistachio dessert.\n\nThis place was wonderful and made you feel very special.  The waitstaff is great at what they do and you will enjoy yourself completely.  Oh and the huge bill I though I was going to have was just upwards of $200 with tip.  Very resonable."
2,"Considering I do the majority of my shopping online... it is a little refreshing to go to B&N to actually feel books in your hands and turn actual pages.  It's a little sad really since I remember a time when there used to be more B&N stores in the Charlotte area.  It is crazy how things have changed.\n\nThis location is pretty convenient to the South Park area.  The parking lot can be a pain-in-the-butt (but usually the problem is that people can't drive).  I once witnessed two ladies almost get into a brawl over a parking space - spoiler alert, the lady that put her car in the space first won and then proceeded to run into the store away from the other crazy lady that was claiming that space as her own - very loudly.... like through the glass of the store loudly (I was upstairs on the 2nd floor looking out of the window).\n\nAside from a sometimes lack of parking spaces, the store is kept neat and proper, like most megabook stores are.  I am surprised there is still a movie/dvd/blu ray section since everyone seems to be streaming their entertainment now-a-days.\n\nI have been impressed with B&N's selection of board games.  A good mix of Euro games and the traditional... makes for good presents.  Overall, this place is great if you can't wait for 2-day shipping... but gone are the days when I used to hang out at stores like this for hours on end."
2,"I bought a groupon and used it right away. Scheduling an appointment was very easy. When I went, I guess they had just relocated their office? So it was very hard for me to find as there was no signs up or anything. The front desk people were very nice & the owner was a sweetheart as well. The lady who did my lashes was nice as well. She kept the whole appointment conversational which I enjoyed because it was a fairly long appointment and it kept me entertained. The only reason why I gave this a three star is because my lashes did not last two days :/ I followed all the instructions given to me. Did not wear make up for 48 hours, did not use anything I wasn't suppose to. After the recommended time to wait befor getting them wet...I washed my face and one by one my lashes were falling off. It didn't even last a week for my family party I had coming up. I was extremely bummed as I paid $60 or so on this groupon. Not sure if it was the application or products used to apply them...but I can assume you 100% I followed the aftercare instructions as I was really trying to get then to last until the family gathering...but it didn't :("
4,Feels like home. DataCenter galore.
4,Fabulous! This is a very good place to go!! Very fast and healthy food!\nStaff very friendly  \nMy Fav. the California Quesadilla! YUMMY!
1,"I eat 3-4 times a week at Chipotle, so not new to Chipotle. But at this location, the staff are very inconsistent with the quantity of meat/chicken, I have had times when i barely got 2-3 oz of meat in my bowl/burrito. Went there today and i had half a spoon of chicken in my bowl. If only they would not be so stingy about meat/chicken, i would have no complaints about this place. Please get your staff to read the quantity to be served from the Chipotle website and help them understand it (if they can).\n\nFor now, might just skip this location and go to the one on Maryland."
2,"I'm a fan of Drag queen bingo. Very entertaining ladies thank you. I'm not a fan of the rude people, how hot it is and all the damn smoke. I should send you my doctors bill after i have my lungs replaced. Bartenders and the door man are sweet and friendly. And Mike has a great pour. I probably will never go back though i can't stand all the smoke and how disgusting i smell when i leave."
3,Excellent BBQ just a short walking distance from the Epicenter. Try the Pulled Pork Quesadilla. It's cut into 4 wedges and big enough for sharing.
2,"Had a gift card here to take the wifey.  There is nothing too extravagant about this place, but the food is decent and the scenery and ambience made me feel like we were in Italy.  Therefore, it would be a good date night, but I would not come back again.  Their deal of ordering an entree and getting to take one back home is pretty awesome though.  I have not heard of anything like this before.  It is in a nice spot in Scottsdale, therefore, there are some things to do after or beforehand."
2,"They're OK. I use to right them off completely because the quality of food never compared to back home, price, frequently got bad service, and prefered the other hawaiian place that was down the road towards harmon ave (which closed down awhile back).  But they slowly improved and earned my approval. prices are mid range. lots of seating, pretty good menu selection. good location. short walk between clasess for UNLV students."
0,"Four of us enjoyed dinner there this week but within hours three of us had major stomach issues which to put it mildly put a damper on our enthusiasm for this restaurant.  Be warned.  We had beef, chicken, salad and vegetarian dishes.  Caveat emptor!"
1,"People saying this is great sushi have not even had good sushi. Sorry, I'm a food snob. Actually, I shouldn't apologize for knowing what good Japanese food looks and tastes like.  SakeBomber is another addition to my \""Asian food in Phoenix disappoints\"" list. Oh and I won't embellish on how annoying it is to wear a wristband upon entry if I'm even just contemplating ordering a drink through my meal. \n\nPS: I'm not as bitter as I sound right now."
0,"I went to cv nails today for a simple fill in, she somehow managed to make my nails crooked gave me a hard time when I asked for a nail design. I had to ask her to repaint my nails twice because they looked so sloppy and smudged after the third time I got frustrated and left. She was hands down the laziest worst nail tech ever the only reason why I gave them a star is because they were clean. Not going back there again!"
2,"Getting to this hotel by car was a challenge. When you arrive at the airport, you can see the hotel. But there are only signs leading you to it when you can't miss it anymore. Maybe not the hotel's mistake per se as the airport roads are undergoing severe maintenance, but an issue to address anyway.\n\nWhen arrived, there are lots of parking spaces behind the hotel. The lady at the reception was very helpful and friendly. Being platinum with SPG, I was bumped up to a suite - thank you very much. \n\nThe room was very spacious - doh. I found some clothes from a previous guest in the drawer. Despite the room appearing very clean and tidy, that decreased my confidence in the cleaning services somewhat. The room was quiet, but some of the planes do take off next to the hotel. And unlike the Sheraton in Brussels Airport for example, this one is not completely soundproof... No minibar, but a coffeemaker. \n\nRoomservice is a joke. Tried to order some food on Saturday night at 10pm, and had theire voicemail. Called again after 15 minutes and had voicemail again. So after 10 minutes I called guest services to complain and they somehow managed to find the people responsible. So they called me, take my order, and tell me the chef will hurry to make up for the time. Unfortunately, you can't hurry up without showing that in the quality of the food. So I had an overcooked burger and undercooked fries. The onion rings were ok... \n\nSo all in all not a bad stay, but expectations were higher. Staff that cares just a little more can make so much of a difference in a place like this, that has all the right other assets."
1,"Average food at above average prices, and below average ambiance.  It's a tiny restaurant with a few tables inside, and several more tables \""outside,\"" if you can call it that (but not even in the fancy Grand Canal area).  It really felt like I was eating a fancy dinner seated in the middle of the mall.  The service was spot-on, but that can't make up for their more fundamental shortcomings.  Next time, I'd rather eat at a restaurant with classier ambiance, like Canaletto along the Grand Canal... or at just about any Carino's or Macaroni Grill..."
3,"Stayed here in June 2007. The renovations are nice but I'm not really a fan of the logo or the concept. Don't really get what the identity or message of this place, if that makes sense. \n\nThe rooms are still the same size and quality. I got upgraded to the larger room, deluxe I think, which is always nice (always ask). They changed the shampoo/soap/etc with the new theme and that's a GREAT thing. No more funky, spicy shampoo.\n\nFeels like the staff is better too. Hopefully being more formally part of the Starwood family will have a positive impact on service, even if the personnel stays the same. Their service was average at best before the conversion. \n\nThe new 24 hour restaurant called the Dailies looks much better but the breakfast was horrible. They found a way to screw up eggs scrabled with some veggies. The sausage tasted like it was straight from the microwave. Service was pretty darn slow too. Pass on breakfast here.\n\nI like other hotels in Las Vegas much better, but the price is right and you get Starwood points."
1,"A nice hotel and ok staff, but being a local i'm kind of disappointed this is the closest casino to me.  I play poker for a living, so on my day off i like to gamble (LOL) and have a few beers.  Anyways, I don't drink and drive so if I don't have a buddy driving, i may come here on a day off and kill some time if we're gonna drink then cab it back.\n\nAnyways, the place just seems dead most of the time.  The sister property (Red Rock) is much funner and nicer, but it's a hike to get there...and the M is nicer as well \n\nNever stayed in the rooms so I can't comment there"
2,"The ruebans are decent, but not worth the 12.50 they charge.  Service is great though."
2,"I don't get Toys R Us.  I really don't.  It's not that I don't like toys, because I do.  But this place is just a massive store, full of people at any time of year - and around the holidays, it's even worse.\n\nAs if things weren't bad enough, the staff is completely useless.  Go ahead and ask them where (anything) is, and you'll be amazed that they can't help you find (anything).  It's just unbelievable.\n\nI get that they want to put (everything) out on the floor, so that if you want a DVD to go with the Lego set that you're buying, you'll be able to find it.  But then they decide that the DVD is too popular, so instead they lock it up in the restricted area with video games, so they don't actually have it in the area where the promo material is, and the people in the Lego area don't have a freaking clue.  It's just a mess.\n\nYou're better off wandering around and looking for it on your own.  Or ordering online.  the prices are better anyway, you don't have to deal with the crowds and you can dress - or not - however you like."
3,"Love the new location...much more comfortable, and will be even more so when the summer heat gets here.  Tried the ribs and the chicken and both were awesome.  One star loss for the fries which were a little oily and limp, and the black beans which were a bit dry.  But the ribs and chicken were worth coming back for again and again."
0,"It took 30 minutes to get a water; I didn't even notice if I enjoyed the food I ate because I was so pissed at the crappy service.  It smelled great, but I can enjoy that smell by walking by and avoid the headache."
0,"The owners Susan and Chris are nice people but they are having some serious business problems which I believe are distracting them.  When I arrived to drop off my dog, Susan and I went over what I brought to feed him (they recommend you supply your own food to avoid gastric problems) and the 2 toys I brought to keep him entertained.  Just to be sure there was no confusion, I also left very simple written instructions about his food and clearly marked everything as well.\n\nWhen I picked the dog up two days later, he was fine, but I discovered none of his food had been given to him and no toy or treat was given to him either!  When I called her back to discuss what went wrong, she apologized and said she apparently misunderstood me.  As I unpacked the little bag I sent with the dog, I realized everything reeked of cigarette smoke--it permeated every single thing I sent with the dog, even his leash and harness!  Looking back, I'm so glad I at least made sure he had his bed and blanket in the pen before I left or he might have been sleeping on the cold floor!  I think they mean well but are caught up with their problems at the moment.  If this could happen when they only had a couple of dogs there, I can't imagine what could go on when they have a full house.  I won't be going back to Small Town Dog."
4,Love this place! I bring my stuff here to consign and I shop here as well. I've had lots of luck here and it's located in a great shopping center close to Last Chance!! Perf!
4,"On of the best affordable golf course in Phoenix AZ area. Its a course architect in South Mountain AZ next to Foothills Golf. They share the same landscape but some how this course layout is pleases my eyes more than Foothills. Both are affiliates to Ahwatukee Golf CC. I can hardly forget the PAR 3 (200ish yards) sitting high up on the mountain, on the black tee the green is tug in right and you barely see the pin if the placement is by the hill slope. There is a tree at the back of the green and anything on the left (right hand folks who draw be careful) will leave golfers little to no choice but to play a penalty shot. Course layout is somewhat trickier as compare to the more straight forward Foothills (but both is good). A definite visit for golf lovers. \nThe memories i have in still pictures taken left me the urge to always come back for more action."
1,Scallop with grits appetizer was the best thing about this meal. Service was good. Short rib was tender but dry and sauce tasted like bottled BBQ sauce not what I was hoping for from Bobby Flay. Sorbet Trio for dessert were forgettable. Probably wont go back.
1,"I've never claimed to be very Pinoy. I haven't been to the Philippines since I was about 8 years old and until a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco, I had never been to a Jollibee before. Well that visit inspired me to finally check out one of the Vegas locations.\n\nMy mentality as I approached the drive-thru window was simple. I might as well order everything I want to try now. Just get it out of the way so I don't have to come back. I ended up spending $14!\n\nThe verdict? The fried chicken was just so so. The side of mashed potatoes tasted like instant. The side of corn fared better, but basically that fried chicken combo was a bust.\n\nFortunately, the Filipino style spaghetti rocked! Honestly, I used to hate the sweetness of Filo spaghetti sauce. I'm probably still partial to a good, tart Italian Bolognese, but I'm totally down with Filo spaghetti these days and it is something that Jollibee does right.\n\nOn to dessert. You can get two pies for $3, so I opted to get both the Mango Peach and the Banana Langka (jackfruit). The Mango Peach was pretty good in its own right, but OMG! The Banana Langka is a superstar. I would totally come back just for that. It's basically like Turon. And that equals yumminess.\n\nOverall, I can't give Jollibee more than two stars. It just misses the mark on basic food flavor (I'm referring to the fried chicken deal and the one bite of my cousin's cheeseburger I tried in SF). Still, it is totally worth a visit just for that Banana Langka Pie!"
0,"I have been gassing up here at least 1x a week the past few years. Very convenient location for me. I even use the drive thru car wash which usually did a great job. The last time I went thru the car wash, my car came out sopping wet. I keep a towel in my car and jumped out to wipe it down. Out of town I had to drive away and decided to come back the next day and ask for a refund. The clerk said she would have to ask the manager and came back to say they couldnt offer me a refund because I didnt announce there was a problem until the following day. No one even went outside to look at my car and survey the situation. This happened about 3 months ago and I have never returned since. If they dont want to refund me a measly $8 for a shitty carwash, I certainly wont be spending $60+/week to fill up my tank."
0,"Original location is in Chicago. I haven't been. Also, New York, and now Las Vegas. Oh, and in case you are in Chicago and can't find the original, they built two (2). I am confident in your navigation. Good luck. I am done with the Las Vegas location."
3,"Went in for the lunch special, place was busy, but got service quickly, ordered the curry off the menu with tofu and brown rice , it arrived quickly and while it wasn't the best i have had in Vegas it defiantly was not the worst either.  I was very happy with the food and service and the pricing was great $17 for 2 people thats lunch and ice tea.  \n\nIll go again"
1,"Met a friend here off of the 4 star yelp rating, thought we'd give it a try.  Sweet and sour chicken was pretty rough, many \""bouncies\"" in the chicken as I call it.  Sauce was meager and as hungry as I was I couldn't bring myself to  finish the dish.  Friend ordered shrimp w/lobster sauce, said it was o.k.\n\nService was great and the people were quite nice.  \n\nPerhaps they have better dishes, and the place is worthy of its 4 star ranking, but I just don't see it."
4,This is my favorite place for breakfast and brunch. Their French Toast is epic! The owners are super nice and walk the floor to make sure you're comfortable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for amazing food at an affordable cost.
3,"We went here for breakfast, the line was long but moved quickly. The restaurant itself is very spacious, I had the chicken and waffle which was very delicious. My friend liked the shrimp scampi as well. I would go back here again for their chicken and waffle. The reason it has four stars is because the staff wasn't friendly with no personality."
4,"I had to find a club appropriate shirt pretty last minute. It had to be red for a charity theme. I tried Mastrionni Fashions, which has served me well a few times before. No luck. Then I went near Boca Park. I figured my odds of success would increase by searching at a larger retail area. First, I tired Banana Republic across the street. They had one red button-up shirt for $60, it felt very thin and cheaply made. Then since I was there, I tried the Gap next door. No surprise, even worse luck. \n\nAlmost giving up, I shot across the street to the Men's Wearhouse. I walked in and was greeted by a nice salesman. I told him the situation, and he was eager to help. He measured my neck, arm length and chest. Then he grabbed a solid red shirt for me. It was dead-perfect. They had a 2 for 1 sale going on. He showed me the section of shirts that would fit me, and I grabbed another shirt that I liked. It was also a perfect fit. The shirts here were at least three times the quality of the crap that Banana Republic was trying to sell. Wrinkle free FTW!! And at two-for-one, they came out to about $40 each. They also had just received some great hockey sweatshirts and jackets that were also two-for-one. I grabbed two great Rangers items for my dad and got some Christmas shopping done while I was there. Everyone from the salesman to the lady ringing me up were extremely friendly and helpful. The salesman steamed my shirts and another salesman was trying to give me crap about the Rangers, suggesting I bought some Red Wings stuff instead. It gave me a pretty good laugh. \n\nIn summary, I would definitely return to this Men's Wearhouse for future purchases. I was taken care of from the moment I stepped through the door, to the moment I left. Plus, they aint just whistlin' Dixie when they \""guarantee\"" you'll like the way you look. \n\nHow often do you get to read a review with the words \""whistlin' Dixie\"" in it??"
3,"I had been waiting for my extra weekly cheat meal to try this place. I finally got sick of waiting and went for my Sat night feast. I have regrets.. regrets that I didn't go sooner!\n\nThis was absolutely delicious. I went with two other people and we ordered the \""Lalibela Exclusive.\"" This is primarily a combination of their meat dishes with a few of the vegetable options. Sadly I wont be able to review in detail as I usually do because there was so much on the plate I could not remember what exactly was what. There was nothing on that combination that I didn't like. There were a few things I liked more then others but everything was tasty.\n\nI don't think I would recommend this place for a \""first date\"" but would be a fun night out for an established relationship. The whole messy, eating with your hands, making a big mess, just doesn't seem like the best first impression material ;)\n\nWhat I have found sucks the most about trying all of these new places is that I want to go back right away and cant :( I felt this way about both Lalibela and Los Compadres.. But the list of places to try is big and I'm having a GREAT time doing it.\n\ninjera:\nThis is your fork for dinner. Its a light airy tortilla/pancake like bread made of teff flour. Pretty sure this stuff expands in the stomach because we were all surprised how full we got and how quickly.\n\nPros:\nGreat combination pricing. Three of us walked away stuffed, having tried nearly 3/4 of their menu for about $15 including tip.\n\nPlenty of seating even for a busy Saturday night.\n\nVery sweet wait staff.\n\nCons:\nKitchen/Service is a little slow\n\nCommunal eating is fun but easy to spread germs. Make sure everyone is healthy and with freshly washed hands :)\n\nPretty sure my hands will smell delicious for a few days."
0,"I waited a few days to write this to contemplate how I feel about my experience at Blue Martini.   I don't go out much, as I have two small children and prefer spending time with them.  My sisters--in-law both decided to surprise me for my birthday, arranged to have my mother-in-law watch my kids, and took me out to Blue Martini.  It was a Wednesday night (Ladies' Night).   I've heard the rumors about cougars etc., but the bar was not very busy.  We didn' t care - we weren't there to meet people, just relax and have a good time.  \n\nWe sat at the bar so we could have front row seats for the band that was performing, and I have to say, the band was awesome!  Best part of the whole evening.  We ordered drinks, and the bartender gave us great service, although that might have had something to do with the color of my sister-in-law's AMEX, who knows.  \n\nThe reason I have to give this place one star  is the clientele, and the fact that my cell phone was stolen while I was there.  As I mentioned, we sat at the bar all night.  I used my phone to have the bartender take our photo, so I know the last time I had the phone.   I would like to think it was a customer that took it and not an employee, but I can't know for sure - all I know is a really nice phone is gone, with photos of my kids that cannot be replaced, and no one turned it in.  I tracked it the next day to downtown Phoenix at Washington and Central.  That rules out the phone being \""lost.\""  I have lost sleep over this, and for a bar that is supposedly sophisticated with high end service and clientele, I should not expect that my property will be stolen while I'm there.  Not only can the photos not be replaced, I definitely can't afford to get the phone replaced.  When I called to inquire about it, I didn't get anywhere, and so now I've decided to file a police report.  A place that boasts high-end clientele and people need to resort to stealing someone else's phone?  I think not.\n\nSo, if you go to Blue Martini, be on your guard.  It may be considered \""upscale,\"" but that doesn't mean the clientele and staff are honest."
0,My husband and I went here the day after our wedding and it was super busy for lunch. The service was terrible. Also this place gave my husband food poisoning and he spent the rest of our honeymoon in the bathroom and ruined our trip. He ordered the chicken tacos. I tell everyone that goes to vegas to avoid this place at all costs.
1,"The hours are horrible, Monday thru Friday not open til 1pm... Hire more ppl so your business can make some $. I travel almost 40 mins away to have this place n they keep changing hours of opening.... Its freakn annoying"
4,I am very impressed how the manager took care of us after there was an issue. That show great  customer service skills. I wish there was a whataburger in California and I would want him as the manager. Thanks for a great burger as always.
4,"This is one of the best buffets I have had in Vegas. This place is comparable to the Wynn Buffet, only cheaper - $30pp. Came here on a Monday evening, and there was a line! This place had to be good...\n\nWaited for about 30 mins and entered the establishment. WOW, this place was huge! Scoped out the stations and had so many choices! \n\nAll beefs I tried were delicious - loved the quail!!! Seafood trip was pretty tasty with crab legs and shrimp cocktail. Also had a made to order seafood pastry with shrimp and scallops. Desserts were to die for with so many selections!!\n\nOur service was prompt and our waitress was super nice. Would definitely come back again!"
0,"There have been many times when I knew right away that I was in love with a burger, but rarely have I disliked one instantly. That is until now of course, in the case of Cheeburger Cheeburger. I actually stated \""I hate this bun\"" as soon as I swallowed my first bite, and it only went downhill from there. Read on if you dare.\n\nThere are apparently many locations all over the country of this place, although I can't say it's really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town. And after my experience, I'm not sure if I would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a stand-alone Johnny Rockets; 50's diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls. It's extremely gimmicky, and much worse than any Fatburger I've ever been near. It wasn't overly crowded the night I was there for dinner, but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.\n\nThe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce 'beginner', along with chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads and the option of supposedly over 1,285,000 combinations of shakes. They offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter, pepperoni and salsa. I guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.\n\nI was excited to see Heinz 57 sauce as an option, and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. As I said, upon first bite the bun turned me off; it was incredibly dry, had no flavor, and was way too thick and large for the sandwich. It was grilled and buttered on the inside, but that little bit of flavor couldn't compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness. The meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor, but the person I was eating with didn't have as much luck so I question their consistency and must assume I was lucky for now. My mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount I was given got lost in the other flavors. And by other flavors I really just mean my Heinz 57 sauce, which completely took over the entire burger with its semi-BBQ flavor. I always thought I liked that sauce, but apparently not on burgers. I also must note that I only ordered the 1/3lb burger which I can easily handle, but this was so bad I only finished a little more than half.\n\nThe one positive factor of this meal was that because of my Foursquare check-in we were given a free order of small  1/2 fries and  1/2 onion rings. Both of them were ok; the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket. The onion rings were the thin, greasy, crispy battered type which I love, as opposed to the thick-breaded, hard to bite through variety. They were good, although I'm just not a huge fan of onion rings. They offer a few different dipping sauces; we went with the Zesty Horseradish sauce which was ok I guess.\n\nBy the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything. We almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating. The only tasty parts of our meal were the Oreo and Peanut Butter Cup shakes we got, and that's not something I typically order. With the free fries and onion rings our meal cost $25.20, it would have been over $30 if those weren't free. This price does include $7.98 for two shakes, but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were. $6.99 for a burger isn't a bad price, especially off the strip, but what I was given I wouldn't pay for again. I'm not even going to sugarcoat it, just avoid this place."
4,Excellent seafood!! The mahi tacos are my favorite!!
3,"In celebration of changes and playing so much at Green Valley Ranch I was setup to go to dinner at Hank's.\n\nThe atmosphere although darker is very rich with light and decorations. The minute you walk in you are facing an amazing bar with a double glass cooled wine units. The piano was playing and the glass rock fireplace rightfully placed up high was well going. Sure its 109 degrees in Las Vegas right now but when your in this air conditioned heaven you forget all about it. \n\nReservations at 8PM, after only a couple minutes at the bar I was escorted to my table where I placed my order for the Caesar salad which was topped off with freshly ground pepper. Skipping the appetizer I went straight to the main course choosing Salmon with a side of foie grois.\n\nMaker's Mark on the rocks accompanied my dinner and it was the perfect match. \n\nThe salmon was a little plain but perfectly cooked. And they offered toppings and sauces I could have chosen from but none were recommended to me. This was my second time dining at hank's."
4,"I've eaten at China Grill several times.  I always enjoy the food and service.  The food is modern Chinese with a flare. The portions are perfect and the flavors are wonderful.  I always get the steak dish with the onion rings (I forget the name of the dish).  I would highly recommend if you are in the Vegas area.  Food is pricey, but worth it.\n\nThe bathroom is also pretty cool."
2,"I was driving to the store and saw the sign for Citizen.....Right away I knew I needed to try this place as part of the Coffee Tour of Phx... (ftw). I made a u turn and stopped in. The space is cute, I like all of the colors and the little 'bar' area that looks out over central. I felt that the latte was just ok, not bad, but nothing special. The milk didn't have that creamy mouth feel that you get from a good latte and the first sip was a bit bitter (subsequent sips were a little better). I understand they use Lola coffee, but I think the difference is in the baristas. I also tried their blueberry scone....I thought it was way too wet and sweet for a scone, more like a flat muffin. Not really for me. I don't think I would go out of my way to get coffee here."
0,Don't go here. This place is horrible. It's in the ghetto. It's not worth you time. There are better places out there
0,"I have never filled out a Yelp review, but I feel everyone should know how terrible this place is. \nThe first indication not to go in was he sign being off, wish we would have turned around then. But we gave the place a chance. We were asked what we wanted to drink before we had even seen a menu. Ordered ice tea and received a murky brownish water that hardly resembled tea. Then we were immediately asked what we wanted to eat. Obviously, having barely opened the menu, we nicely asked for a minute. \n\n20 minutes later, the waitress had made several rounds to the only 2 other occupied tables, and that's when we decided this place was not worth that kind of a wait, just to put an order in. So, we put $5 on the table for the half drank glass of tea, and we left.\n\nJust as we stepped outside, we realized that no one deserved $5 for an awful glass of tea. So, one of us went back inside to removed the $5, hoping that would help them understand that they really need to work on customer service. Only to find out, in walking out the door and turning around, the  $5 had already been picked up. Had someone just been waiting for us to walk out so they didn't have to serve us?\n\nRedeeming food service was quickly found at Burger King, just up the road. Burger King has a very friendly staff and they even changed part of my order with a smile on their face. \n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AT Space Age!!! GO TO Burger King, SERIOUSLY!!!"
1,"The restaurant looks inviting, and like a good time. However, the two pizzas i've eaten there have been rather subpar, and the service has been some of the worst in the city. Both times i've been there we waited 15 minutes until someone came to our table. That's about what can sum up this place. Others may enjoy, because it brings one of the few more upscale restaurants to oakland, but it still just does not do it for me."
0,"We stopped in here to get out of the rain. Sat at the bar. Ordered beers which, eventually, grudgingly, arrived. Asked for menus. Twice. Waited half an hour with closed menus and expectant looks, while multiple servers and bartenders passed us without acknowledgement. Gave up, paid the check and moved on. \n\nService is unhurried in Montreal -- that's part of its charm -- but the staff here just plain ignored us. Don't bother. There are so many superior alternatives."
3,I went there for a Deaf EXPO. This place is so huge and beautiful. It is in the right location because the bar/restaurants are nearby. The parking garage is across the street. I enjoyed this visit very much.
3,"Woooooooo! My friend who is from Boston put this on me and I've been hooked since. Especially since it's UBER hot that this hits the spot. \n\nI got the strawberry Italian ice with vanilla gelato and LOVE how the texture of the ice reminded me of Otter Pops....I love otter pops!\n\nThe gelato on top didn't do it for me but, I'll most def be back for the Italian ices.\n\nLines here are sometimes cray and the workers seem unhappy but, the ice makes up for it for me."
4,"I come every Friday for the great clam chowder. Lots of clams and flavored perfectly. This week I got a royal flush and four aces! I always do well on their games, but this week was spectacular. \nThe staff is always super friendly and remembers my favorite drink. It's ready when I sit down. Check it out if you haven't!"
2,"We did the $25 at 22.  Great deal but...Unique presentation on the appetisers with escargot on tube pasta and panko encrusted goat cheese salad with walnuts. The latter was a hit. The former though different was okay but not wow. \n\nMain dishes were just okay. We've had better at Le Selecte in Toronto. Duck confit was mostly tender with some dry bits, but wasn't that flavourful.  Steak frites was also just okay. A bit on the tough side.  But the frites were really great. The potatoes were sweet, crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. Nice!  Too bad it was the highlight of the dinner.\n\nThe French Toast and Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e were both pretty good.  But after all the hype about this restaurant, we were hoping for something more..."
4,I must say I am very partial to this hotel and casino. My husband and I were married in Vegas five years ago and stayed at the Golden Nugget. We return on every anniversary to celebrate and sometimes go an additional two or three times a year. Our passion is playing Black Jack and we have grown fond of many of the casino staff over the years. We have met some of the greatest people there and always have a fabulous time! The hotel itself offers many great restaurants and services and I love that it is in the nostalgic downtown of Las Vegas.
0,"It's just an over priced place with very little regard to service. We had to wait for half an hour after which we got the table and the food took another half hour to come. My husband ordered an extra roti which came after 25 mins of us just sitting and waiting staring at the entree!!! I ordered a Kashmiri chicken tikka masala which was extremely bland, my suggestion would be check out curry corner (just a block away) for half the price and way better taste. All and all if you wish to blow your money on fraud tasteless Indian food... Go ahead and try it."
1,"The food and service have seriously gone downhill at this restaurant, which used to be a favorite. The service was make-believe good--server circled solicitously, but our food arrived congealed and cold. The short ribs, which I've had here before, were small, fatty and greasy, covered with mystery gravy, and hideously overpriced for bad cafeteria-style food. Don't come here for the food."
3,"Chase field would be my 5th baseball stadium that I've been too. My boyfriend and I are big baseball fans and we try to visit the local team when we go travel. I wouldn't normally visit Phoenix, AZ but it was my BF's point of destination from his military duties. \n\nThe stadium is located right in downtown and walking distance from our hotel (Hyatt). Right when I stepped outside from our hotel, the heat hit me like a ton of bricks! There was no point of taking a shower because I was already drenched in sweat! ick! \nAs I opened the doors to the stadium, a cool breeze wrapped around me, like a hug from my mom when I'm sick. OMG THEY HAVE AC and a retractable roof! What a freaken relief! \nNow I think ALL stadiums should have one! LoL\n\nSo besides the awesome AC, It seemed like Chase field has an awesome section of your typical stadium food. Hot dogs, Pizza and of course, my favorite the garlic fries. The garlic fries I got that day was delicious! I don't know if it's normally that good here, but wow. My fries were crunchy on the outside and soft inside with a right amount of garlic and Parmesan cheese. I highly recommend getting some.\n(I'm a garlic fries freak)"
1,"My wife and I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time after hearing several friends enjoy their visits. Read plenty of reviews both positive and very negative but went yesterday for the Thursday night date night special, 2 salads, appetizer, and a pizza to share for $20. Not a bad deal.\n\nCaesar salad was quite good, my wife's strawberry and Gorgonzola salad was good for her, I don't like that kind of thing. The salads are a very decent to big portion. \n\nWe got the Caprese appetizer (which is a half order with the special), which is four pieces, and the S.O.P. pizza. \n\nService was decent, however the inside where we sat, as the patio was packed, was less than 1/3 full of roughly 20 tables. But still quite noisy. \n\nThe pizza is OK at best, nothing special. Quite a few fun and different choices. However, the pizza is a 9in pizza, which is fine for sharing, with thick outside fluffy crust, but very thin crust on the bottom. Thin to the point that is is soggy and the toppings fall off when you pick up a piece, so a knife and fork are required. \n\nAll together for a $20 dinner for two, it is a good deal for the money. However, if you are planning to order alcohol, beware. $7 for a small brandy style glass of Sangria, or $4 for a 12oz domestic is quite steep. Happy hour and the Thursday night date night is a decent value for your money. However if you are coming for anything else, salads at $6-$10/each, appetizers for $5-$13/each, and very average pizza for $10-15 for a personal pizza, there are far better places in the area to visit and enjoy."
4,Cute little free museum in the heart of Scottsdale! The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable!  I could spend a whole day chatting with them! You must walk through if you are in town!
1,"Was there the other night, and since its reopening, I have found that the food is at least fine. Good variety, and with the sushi, sashimi, and rolls, (and delicious crab legs!) it works. The weekend price is a bit higher than I would like, but it's not horrible, by any stretch. \n\nI will be back, with normal expectations, and I will be satisfied. Very standard.\n\n3 stars for the food minus 1 star for repeated visits where staff gave old bills to avoid declaring all revenue and taxes. Disgusting. If you charge me tax, you remit the tax. It's simple, really."
1,"The food was great. I had the short rib, my husband had the steak and frites. The atmosphere was classic French bistro. Very nice wine selection. The reason for the low rating is the service. It was awful--our server forgot to bring our wine, brought us the dessert menu before our entree was served. He was totally distracted the entire time and MIA the entire dinner."
3,"Nestled in Charlotte's music neighborhood, Mattie's Diner is the envy of my imagination.  I wish I had opened this place myself.  I love the concept.  I love the location.  I love the menu selection.  If you're going to be in Charlotte for a concert, try this diner."
3,"I went through 3 different emotions from the moment I placed my order to when I received my order. First I saw the prices. $2 tacos, $4 burritos, $10 for combos. Yay, cheap food!!  So I ordered one beef taco for $2 and one beef burrito for $4. Next I saw the portion. The burrito wasn't a \""burrito\"" I am used to eating. So I was a little confused. And I thought the portion was so small. Once again, not what I am used to. So sadness came over me. I sat down to eat my meal. OMG, these people know how to make tasty Mexican food! Pure joy and happiness began to take over any past emotions. The food was very tasty. And it turned out the portion wasn't small at all. I got full on just those two orders. The point is, this place is awesome! Sooo good! 4 stars instead of 5 because they don't give you utensils when dining in. I literally sat down and had to get up again to find the forks. And it was so crowded in there, getting the fork wasn't easy. I saw that most people were eating with their hands. But they should offer utensils during when the customer is up at the register paying for their meal. I don't mind eating with my hand but when I've been sightseeing all day, I know I do not want to touch my food with my dirty hands. Hence why they need to automatically offer utensils rather than assuming the customer will locate the utensils and take one."
1,"We came for crepes and were quite disappointed.  It was noon on Sunday morning and the place was packed but only has 2 servers working so service was pleasant but very slow.  Buckwheat crepes arrived over cooked, bordering on burnt and fillings were stingy.  The cafe au lait was warm not hot.  Prices were also high and considering the competition I would say this place relies on tourist business.  Chocolate seemed to be their thing so perhaps we should have tried that instead"
1,"Really long wait this morning. Orders were getting lost, customers were waiting a really long time, and there was lots of complaining from the cook.\nThis is only my second chance to try this restaurant and will probably be the last. To start off my experience, my wife and I were asked to wait for a seat. Normally, this is no problem but I could see at least 4 tables that were clean and nobody sitting at them. Not a big deal as we were in no hurry. \nWe were seated and taken care of right away. We ordered coffee and water and needed a couple of minutes do decide on our food. My wife ordered the French toast and I ordered biscuits and gravy. For the next twenty minutes we listened to the cook argue with the waitresses and watched customers walk out the front door. Almost 30 ,minutes went by and our food finally arrived. I got scrambled eggs instead of over easy and the waitress fixed it right away. My wife's meal was warm but certainly not hot.\nAs I dug into my biscuits and gravy, I was greeted by crunchy biscuits and a sad excuse for gravy. The biscuits tasted like the kind you would get in a tube of Pillsbury and I needed a knife to cut them. The gravy was clumpy and tasteless. I have been cooking gravy for many years and it looked like the flour, or mix, in this case was thrown in and not blended very well. This was, by far, the worst plate of biscuits and gravy I have every eaten. Biscuits and gravy is a relatively easy dish to do well and it says volumes when a breakfast restaurant cannot do it right.\nI did let the girl at the register know how disappointed I was with my breakfast and she took it off my bill. That was very cool.\nMy first time to Rise and Shine was pretty good and the second was less than impressive. I was told that the reason the prices were a little high is because of the quality ingredients that were used. I would disagree. It seems like either corners are being cut or the cooks are not happy with their jobs. Either way, this will probably be my last adventure out of the way to come to Rise and Shine.."
1,"Hey there goes Louis Vuitton! Ooooh, Prada! Hello there, Gucci! Wait a minute, aren't there like several other locations of these stores within a 3 mile radius of this place? \n\nThere's not really a single accessible store or restaurant in here, and to make it worse, many of the stores in this \""new\"" mall have already existed on The Strip for more than 10 years. With how hard they were trying to make this place \""different\"" you would think they would have brought in something new to the table. For what it's worth, there are some very interesting architectural details and public artwork within this mall worth seeing at least once (I really liked the glowing trees, okay they weren't exactly glowing but I'm not sure how else to describe them), but that doesn't make me any more interested in browsing at a Gucci store when I can just browse at one down the street. \n\nExcuse me while I go down to the Fashion Show or the Forum Shops, browse in the super upscale stores I can't afford but can still manage to buy something at a more reasonable store anyway. At least those two malls don't completely reek of pretension and feel closer to the real world if you know what I mean."
4,"We were on the campus for an event on Saturday and decided to try out this place. The food was awesome, prepared hot. I tried Chicken garlic masala and my wife tried Chicken curry and both were great tasting.\n\nWill certainly visit this place next time on the campus."
4,"This Pan-Asian restaurant provides an innovative menu of delicious dishes in a casual atmosphere that doesn't cut corners on flavor or spiciness. The menu had so many options, it was hard to decide what to order.   I had the pho dip sandwich - I wasn't even that hungry when I ordered it, but ended up inhaling it because it was so freakin' good.  Had a taste of the Chicken Katsu that my brother ordered, which was delicious.  We also ordered the dragon breath fries, which had real Asian heat, not Asian-restaurant-catering-to-white-people heat. YUM."
3,"For those of you who like hitting things with sticks to make loud noises, then this is the place to go.\n\nThey have an amazing selection of different brands, cymbals, accessories, sticks and well, drums. The shop often has sales on so you can get some good deals on a lot of items. The staff are great, obviously really into music and great at recommending things to suit your needs. This shop is probably Edinburgh's best drum shop as it is devoted purely to drums so it has the largest selection. Worth a visit for any drummer."
3,"The atmosphere in this place is strange.  It keeps a busy crowd and the staff is not rude, but I guess you could say indifferent.  I can't complain about that because I don't think I have ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant that was extremely hospitable.  What gets this place four stars is the food and prices.  I have had the Pho, Bun Mi, spring rolls, egg rolls, fried rice, stir fried noodles, and vermicelli and they are all really good and very cheap.  One of the few places left that you can get a delicious filling meal for under $5 still."
0,"I just spent a lifetime at Einstein in attempt to grab a bagel to go.   After what seemed like an eternity I started timing the process - 35 MINUTES to get a bagel to go ??!!  The place was clearly mismanaged - orders were taken at the end register rather than the first counter causing a long line of grumpy customers.  We were asked twice to move out of the way to allow an employee to wheel a large cart through the line to restock orange juice.  Why she had to use the cart to carry 3 orange juice was a bit of a mystery;  I can only assume it was yet another attempt to annoy their already displeased customers.  When I finally reached the register I found a grumpy woman who repeatedly mumbled something at me that another customer finally interpreted as \""toasted?\"".  After paying I was shuffled to an area filled with people standing around, arms crossed, frowning in the final phase of this farcical adventure.  As orders were ready yet another unhappy employee barked out descriptions of the items ordered - thereby causing further confusion among the angry crowd.  Finally - my order was ready and not at all worth the wait.  I will never return to this Einstein and will instead take my business across the street to Bagel Nosh."
3,"One of my favorite Harris Teeters in the University area, although it may qualify as Northlake. It was remodeled from a former Lowes foods and they did a great job. The produce section is abundant with a nice selection of organics. The salad bar is large and always fresh. The pizza bar looks great and makes me wish I can eat pizza. They have a surprisingly huge pet supply section with pretty good prices. I was looking forward to Harris Teeter remodling their other stores to be like this one but sadly it seems that won't happen."
0,"Absolutely the worst mani/pedi place in town.  The owner was extremely rude.  They continuously spoke in Vietnamese, and they were obviously speaking poorly of their customers.  VERY unsanitary!  I will NOT EVER go back.  Poor service and very disappointed with my mani/pedi."
2,"I am a man now. I had haggis for breakfast here. \n\nIt's too touristy, but then again, what do you expect? I used to go here for a drink as it is relatively close to the stop for the Aircoach. \n\nPints are 50-60 p cheaper if you walk 2 streets away from the Royal Mile, but, then again, if it's only the one pint you're having, who cares?\n\nNice, but nothing special. Good if you're a tourist."
3,"Outdoors, cold beer, good burgers, good people watching, Love this place for the open air and friendly staff. Avoid if it is too hot and no breeze. Or too cold. Burgers are good and happy hour beer is cold."
2,"Wife does not eat anything out of the ocean, which limits our restaurant excursions when together.  But I am OK with sushi and Yotto is one of the better ones in the Charlotte area.  Sushi is their specialty.\n\nIt has a local flavor, similar to what you find in Japan.  Small, clean, family-run, fresh fish and reasonable prices.  Food is served with pride, even with the no-family wait staff.  They like this place and you will, too.\n\nIn the Quail Hollow Harris Teeter shopping center."
0,"I'm absolutely clueless as to why this place is rated 4 stars; nothing about this place is 4 stars.\n\nI spent $300 after a corporate discount for 2 nights in a \""luxury\"" room with my girlfriend and there was absolutely nothing luxurious about it. The room smelled nice and the furniture looked french, but that's about as good as it got.  There was no closet in the room at all.  The worst part was the bed, which was a nasty old spring mattress older than I am (pushing 30); seriously, their rooms have hands down the oldest, most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever seen.  I would expect to find a bed like that in a mom and pop motel in the middle of nowhere, not a \""luxury\"" room in a 4 star resort. I had to pay an extra $45/night to upgrade to a room with an upgraded bed but if I wanted to sleep on a king size bed with my girlfriend I had to get a smoking room (and of course I'm not a smoker).\n\nThe staff was not helpful at all; nobody offered to help us move our luggage or apologize for the laughably bad bed they tried to give me.  The music they play in the elevator is all from the 50's because they can't afford to license music anyone wants to hear.  All the French accents in their 80's informational videos and hold messages are horribly fake, their super-slow Internet access is $15/day, most areas of the hotel need a fresh coat of paint but they're so broke that their mini-fridge isn't even stocked with anything and the only 24 hour food place is a candy store called the Sugar Factory.\n\nAlso, If I'm paying hundreds of dollars a day at a resort in Vegas, I'd expect to be able to drink at the pool.  If you're thinking that too, expect to be told by the crew at the Paris that there's no alcohol allowed.\n\nAll in all, I was disgusted by my experience there and I'll never EVER stay there, gamble in their casino or recommend them to anyone.  For less money, you can stay at the Luxor in a suite with a hot tub.  Paris was the worst time I've ever had in Vegas."
3,My wife and i frequent this Home Depot often for the good deals and the 10% military discount ....the store is very nice organized and the staff are always ready to help!
3,Prices are competitive within the South Hills area for nail salons...maybe even a little bit cheaper. They are clean and you never have to wait for a walk-in appt.
4,"I did a reservation through yelp for about 9 people on a Saturday. \n\nI have to say I was blown away by the service here. We got an awesome server who was very attentive and accommodating. Water was always full and the food and other things we requested came in a timely matter.They accidentally forgot the birthday girl's dish, but was able to provide her with a free dish to make up for it. \n\nI got the Tako roll with the spicy octopus and salmon sashimi and both were delicious and tasted fresh. I also tried my friend's miso butter-fish dish wow! It was so soft and flavorful. \nThe birthday girl got a trio of pastry dessert and a candle to blow out to make her birthday extra special. A nice finishing touch to a great dining experience.\n\nAtmosphere was pretty nice too - upscale ambiance. I would return when I go back to Vegas."
4,Had a blast was down in Vegas on vacation with my family and my fathers family (15 in all) they didn't have seating for that many but they sat us all in the same area. Food was great they had everything from chinese to soul food to fresh sea food and pizza that the kids enjoyed
0,"Ordered drinks and a calamari while we looked over the menu. The server seemed frazzled but worked out the drink order easily enough. While waiting for the food, the chef could be heard yelling at the line cooks. This was the first indication something was wrong. As the manager approached the table next to us, he apologized for the delay in service and promised to comp their desert. This was the second indication things weren't running smoothly. After finishing some cocktails, we ordered a couple glasses of wine, still without our calamari and 15 minutes in. Relaxing became very difficult as the chef continued yelling at the cooks getting louder with each passing minute. About 20 minutes later we see our calamari come out of the kitchen but get delivered to the table next to us. When asking the waiter about the kitchen being slow, he confirmed that our order was delivered to the wrong table. Meanwhile, the table next to us was busy flagging down the manager to get the desert they were promised as he seemed to forget about their comp. After 45 minutes and an empty stomach full of wine, we asked for the check. It was hard to listen to the bumbling idiot of a chef yell orders at people while never actually getting behind the line to help. Also, even after acknowledging the error on the calamari, 15 minutes prior, they still didn't have a new one. Too bad stations doesn't own this place anymore, seems these owners are clueless on how to satisfy a customer. \n\nBy the way, we also tried to send an email to the Aliante but there is no place to find an email address or spot to let them know on their website."
3,"I found Lotus of Siam while doing research about Las Vegas restaurants. It was named \""the best Thai restaurant in United States\"" by couple publications. I've been to Las Vegas a few time and have never ventured out of the strip. So for this trip, we decided to do a little exploration and dine outside of the strip on all meals (well, except the buffets). Thanks to my navigation system, we found Lotus of Siam in no time. The restaurant is located in a big Asian strip mall. I was surprised to see so many Korean restaurants there.\n\nWe had reservation at 8pm. The restaurant was still 3/4 full. We were seated quickly. They have a big menu. I like how they clearly explained every dish in English. Everything looked so good and it was just hard to decide. They also had a huge wine list. We were really surprised that a tiny hole in the wall Thai restaurant could have such a good wine list. The waiter was very helpful on recommending dishes and wines for us.\n\nTheir walls were covered with celebrities pictures. So many famous people were here. I saw my favorite favorite favorite Drew Berrymore's picture. I had to ask them if I can take a picture of their \""Drew Berrymore was here\"" picture. Right on top of Drew Berrymore's picture is Mario Batali's picture. Wow! Mario Batali was here, too!\n\nBF ordered the German Riesling Flight to go with the spicy Thai food. It came in three 2 oz pour of dry, medium and sweet Riesling. They were: Robert Weil Estate Dry, Rheingau 2006; Carl Loewen Leiwener Klostergarten, Mosel-Saar-Ruwer 2005; and Basserman-Jordan Forster Jesuitengarten, Pfalz 2005. He loved the Robert Weil Estate Dry and ordered a glass of it. I like the sweet Basserman-Jordan one.\n\nI read about their Thai sour sausage and asked the waiter about it. The waiter told us they have 3 dishes with sausage. This appetizer dish the most popular and the best one. It's minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice. When I first tasted it, I thought it was.... very different. It wasn't like anything I had before. It was sour, spicy, salty, and crunchy. The flavor was very strong and it took me a while to get used to it. After a few more bite, it grew on me. It was unique and indeed quite good. The sour taste of the sausage and lime juice lingered on my tongue a bit. I like the crunchy texture of the crispy rice pop pop pop in my mouth.\n\nThis classic dish from Thailand consist of green papaya, chili, dry shrimp, tomato, crushed peanut mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. We ordered it medium spicy, but MY GOD this dish was super spicy! When I first put the papaya salad in my mouth, I thought it tasted sweet and sour. But the spicy hit me after I swallow the salad. It made my tongue numb. Being half Korean, BF definitely can handle spicy. But even he was beat by this dish. Man now my tongue feels a little numb right now just thinking about how spicy the papaya salad was. We told the waiter the salad was too spicy, he just smiled and pointed to the small pieces of green chili peppers in the dish, \""yeah... you need to stay away from the pepper.\"" Even though this dish was way too spicy, we still think it's good and like it. Hard to believe, but we actually finished the whole plate.... with lots of ice water and rice of course.\n\nSauteed deep fried thin catfish slice with bone in fresh and dried chili and Thai basil leaves. Funny how this dish is called \""spicy\"" catfish but it's really not spicy at all. Or maybe after that papaya salad nothing is spicy anymore? This dish was really good to eat with rice. The sauteed sauce was so yummy. We poured the sauce over our white rice and each had two bowls. The fish was fried then sauteed. Really tasty!\n\nWe like Lotus of Siam. But we only tried three dishes, so can't really say if it's the best Thai restaurant in the US or not. The three dishes that we tried all tasted very authentic, maybe even more authentic than LA authentic Thai restaurant. They also serve a lunch buffet for about $8. I would like to try that on our next Vegas trip.\n\nIf you're visiting Las Vegas and want to try something different, I would recommend Lotus of Siam. It's authentic and cheap. Service was good, too. The only thing is you probably need a car or take a taxi to get there from the strip."
0,"Don't go here for Tuxes.\n\nWent here to register my groomsmen for tux rentals for my upcoming wedding.  Absolutely AWFUL experience.  Clearly the salespeople make little to no commissions on tux rentals as they were much more concerened with the customers walking through the door than they were with me and my groomsmen.  I went by myself, so maybe they didn't take me seriously; but, after this terrible experience I canceled my order and went to Men's Warehouse by Northlake Mall which was MUCH better.  In fact, if you have any questions about tux rentals, please go see Kim at MW.  She was Incredible, walked me through the entire process, helped me find exactly what I wanted, and much cheaper as well..."
2,We have visited this place for dinner.we have ordered the spring rolls and chicken fried rice.spring rolls were perfect and good.the chicken fried rice was good but the best I have eaten from Thai restaurents they can make it better with Thai flavours.overall it's a good visit
3,The place is clean and the food looks fresh. The food is really good. This place reminds me of Panera bread. The cheddar broccoli bread bowl soup is my favorite
2,"Love Pei Wei. This airport location was super busy, and crowded. It was hard to find a seat. Luckily I was by myself, so I found a seat facing the airport walkway, kinda like a bar table. Anyways, food was good. I had the Mongolian beef and a soda. It's the airport, very pricey, so be prepared to pay almost fifteen bucks for a meal like that! \n\nAll in all, it's what I was in the mood for, so it was worth it cause I was hungry too!  Btw, the restaurant has a full bar with TVs as well."
4,"Cool little dive bar in Old Town Scottsdale.  The bartender, \""Boston\"" was a excellant host and shared lots of great stories about Boston.  Looking forward to going back during Arizona Bike Week and \""Boston\"" promised to stock lots of Shiner Bock for visiting Texans!  Put this place on your bucket list for Arizona Bike Week!  Miller Genuine Draft on tap;  when was the last time you found that!"
1,"The food isn't fresh. I think that's all I really have to say, but I'll expound a bit more on it. I walked in and the host was friendly. The service was pretty good, but the food took a very long time to come out. The chips came to the table quickly, but they were not fresh chips (bagged and colored variety). The salsa was ok, but it wasn't great either. When the food did come out it was obviously microwaved. I got the chimichilada (1 mini chimi and 1 enchilada) and the person I was with ordered a chicken sandwich. \n\nWhen he went to pick it up the bun was so dry it crumbled apart. The fries were microwaved too, and they tasted old. My dish was very large. The rice was over microwaved too though. The chimi was just \""meh\"". There was nothing special about it. The enchilada was good, but I don't think it should have been called an enchilada at all. It was a sort of floppy (not fresh) tortilla folded over cut up portabella mushroom (which did taste good). It had a sweet cream sauce over it. The cream sauce was the best part of the whole dinner, but the flavor of the so called \""enchilada\"" did not go well with the rest of the plate at all. \n\nBeyond the food, I'm positive that there was no one under 60 eating there. I'm not against going to places where I'm the youngest person, but it seemed a bit odd. \n\nI would not recommend this place."
2,"The fried alligator was surprisingly delicious. I came here on a private function for a work gathering, and upstairs they have a bar, dance floor, and a band that my friend's company provided. A nice atmosphere, though I didn't get to explore the menu more than I should have. Mainly composed of southern cooking. Otherwise, this place is generally dead when it comes to the social atmosphere. Hopefully my next review will be a little more in-depth, since I do plan to come back and return to this place to explore a little more!"
0,"Had the pulled pork nachos and BBQ chicken lettuce wraps.  Food was good, but portions were extremely small for price.  Service was horrible.  Took 45 min to get bill at 4 in the afternoon."
0,Sorry but food was not worth it chicken burrito reminded\n me of why I disliked chicken in the past.
4,Best chicken parm in town.
3,"Authentic, delicious, and above all affordable tapas off-strip in Las Vegas. We got a table for 10 same day, without any complications, and tried just about every dish. Without fail, they were incredible, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. I'd like to plug their sangria--red is the best, but if you're looking for something a bit sweeter, the white works as well. The only reason this isn't a five-star review is the overpowering peach flavor of their sparkling sangria."
3,"I wanted to try this place since I first saw it on Man vs Food and I missed coming here for my bday last month.  So my goal was to try to eat here for new years eve as 1 of my last meals for 2009.  Since I'm a big fan of crawfish, that's what we ordered along with the shrimp.  So 4 lbs of food between 2 people along with rice for my friend.  Since I am from Cali, we do have to compare every place to Boiling Crab.  So far, BC is the top.  This place would come in 2nd place.  The prices are pretty reasonable for the seafood since they are market price.  I wish they did post the prices up somewhere but they don't so you do have to ask how much it is per lb for the seafood items.  You do have to order the Hot N Juicy flavoring.  We didn't do the extra spicy and spicy was good enough for us since it did make our nose watery.  As for the size of the crawfish, they were sooo small.  I thought they might be a little bit bigger, but nope.  Small that I even had to take a picture of it since I think I was in shock from the size of it.  ;p  None the less, it was still yummy and I would definitely go back if I was craving crawfish in lv.  Note to remember, you do have to ask for the bibs and salt, pepper, lime sauce since they don't bring it to you initially like BC.  Service was pretty good except there was 1 waitress that seemed a little bit rude when she was talking to the guests so not sure if she was having an off day or if that's just her personality."
0,"Not here to bash just state my encounter. Setting up my appointment was fast easy and painless, very friendly staff. On the day of my appointment I got a phone call 15 minuets before they were scheduled to be here from \""my tech\"" saying that he wouldn't be able to make it after all. I asked if he could come since I already left work 2 hours early to make this window, I was told nothing can be done. Now I'm just extremely disappointed, wish it could have been a better experience."
2,"Cool idea, a place to have a drink and play arcade games.  Its kinda small, not much room to play while others are walking around (drunk).  Watch the dress code, too strict for me.  Would rather forget about the drinks and just go to the Pinball Hall of Fame."
1,"meh. the food looked a LOT better than it tasted. it's definitely better than aria's buffet, but for the price they're charging, it should be a helluva lot better.\n\nsave your money and go to the M buffet."
3,"The lobster bisque is good but not as amazing as other people have said. I am also a harsh judge I am from New England. Service was great, the salad bar was fantastic. My favorite were the little cheese pop-over thingies that appeared at our table."
1,"Overpriced is my first thought. Overall our food was good and service was friendly and all but I wasn't going \""wow\"" because of the price. I don't mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet."
1,"I don't understand what all the hype is about when it comes to Vegas Buffets. Admittedly, I have enjoyed Le Village buffet at the Paris, so I was looking for this one to blow me away, seeing as though it's rated higher than Le Village.\n\nThe buffet items looked great upon first inspection, but when you glance closer, it leaves much to be desired. \n\nI went at lunch time, and they still had breakfast items. They had yummy crispy bacon, the most scrumptious banana walnut pancakes I have ever had and excellent eggs Benedict. Now everything else... Just plain mediocre. \n\nThey tried to do a play on Polenta by adding peas and shredded Parmesan on top, but it completely missed the mark. So did the \""spicy\"" Mac n' Cheese. It didn't even resemble Macaroni n Cheese in the slightest. Then I thought I would try the \""Chile Lime Watermelon\"" (a piece of watermelon cut into a round the size of a quarter with some chili sauce on it), only to discover that it's the same exact flavor that I get with the Mexican fruit carts that add chili and lime on the corner of my street at home! Ummm... Yeah... real innovative. Other dishes just looked plain unappetizing, such as the squid ink pasta. \n\nI wish I could say the desserts were amazing, since that's what they're known for. The only thing amazing and worthwhile in the dessert section was the gelato station. Great chai tea and chocolate gelato flavors.\n\nSave your money and try another buffet. This one was a huge fail."
4,"The best view in the whole city.\n\nI disagree with points about prices. The average cost of a visit stacks up to about \u00a35 worth of Volvic and sturdy pair of shoes. Although I did see one legendary woman climbing up in 3 inch heels.\n\nWhen you do get up you'll never forget it the view, a great place to have a picnic on a summers day.\n\nAny chance of a Tram/Jetpack Link up here guys?"
0,"I'm sorry, Circus Circus, but after 4 days of lodging, I think it's time for a divorce.\n\nLAYOUT: horrible. Who puts the hotel lobby in the back of the building when the main entrance is on the Strip? So basically, you must walk the entire length of the main floor to even get checked in (God forbid you have a lot of luggage). There are no direct elevators to the rooms, so have your walking shoes ready. If you're staying in Manor or Skyrise Tower, you have to get off at the Promenade level and then take another elevator to your room (and the wait is horrible). In general, give yourself 20 minutes early to get down to the lobby if you're meeting someone.\n\nAMBIANCE: this hotel appears severely outdated, sad and depressing. It hasn't been updated since disco was still in vogue. The main floor is a labyrinth of gambling tables and slots, in addition to various sleazy merchants selling sundries and other garbage that nobody wants or needs. The rooms in the Skyrise Tower have been updated, but I still saw peeling wallpaper and there were no coffee machines, fridges or microwaves. So basically, they make you uncomfortable if you want outside food. If you want cold drinks, get ice from the machine in the hallway, fill up the bucket and put your drink on that. Don't bring any food that's quickly perishable because you have nothing to keep it cold with or heat it up anyway!\n\nThis is a great kid-friendly hotel, but I don't want to be around kids when I come to Vegas. The staff looks like they want to be anywhere BUT there, and I would, too, if I had to wear an outdated purple jacket as my uniform. Unless this hotel does some MAJOR renovating all over and changes the layout, I don't see them staying in business for the next 20 years. Cheap and basic are no longer good enough for Las Vegas hotels."
2,"We live right around the corner from Luisa's so we walk here all the time.  The pizza is hands down the best in Charlotte - SO delicious.  However, the service leaves a lot to be desired.  I often feel like I am bothering the servers just for putting in my order and the service is very slow.  Often my appetizers will come out after the pizza.  We have started solely doing takeout from here, but even then the cashier is usually fairly rude and short with us.  \n\nThe pizza is top notch though so as take out customers we will probably continue to return!"
0,"I got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich. The price was good and the staff were nice. The place is good to sit and enjoy the meal.\n\nUPDATE (8/3/14): it seems that drive-thro staff are a little different. Since I like the food, I wanted to try something new and asked for it by the number when driving through. I ordered something and the cashier was saying some details about which or what thing I want as the options. But I wasn't familiar and asked her to repeat (and she was talking very fast) and she refused, thinking that I (We) are some kids playing with the mic. \n\nI asked for the third time, and she said this is not funny (!) and I told her nobody is trying to be funny. So, she called the manager, and he just asked is what we wanted, ignoring what had happened and the food options. The cashier was disrespectful, and the manager was having her back being rude to us.... It was a really bad experience. They didn't put any sauce for us in the bag and no receipt as well. At the window, when she saw us, she said \""I thought you are fooling around\"". I am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this. I had a really bad experience with this TACO BELL... maybe if we were Americans, it could not happen... disappointing as we live in 2014...."
2,"So I feel like Surrender is a more ghetto version of XS. Granted, the night I went there was not the busiest of Vegas club nights, especially for the Encore clubs. My favorite part was the floating white couches and a walkway. But no one was allowed to even touch the pool, unlike at XS where people can wade in the water. \n\nA lot of the very positive reviews I see here involve nights with really awesome DJ's, and for me that would definitely determine my rating for the place. I'll just premise by saying that I wasn't so lucky to go during one of those epic nights. \n\nPROS:\n* of course, it's a wynn club, so the dance floor is open to the outdoors, and there's a gigantic pool in the middle (larger than XS)\n* surrender is encore beach club by day, so it's definitely spacious for its daytime purposes. i think it was too spacious for the night I went..\n* my group got in as VIP because we had a hook up, and it always feels good to bypass a line. \n\nCONS:\n* when the crowd isn't so bumpin' that night, the bouncers watch you like a hawk! two people from my group got kicked out for reasons I can't really remember. Because I was taking care of someone, I got kicked out too, cutting my night short. Ugh, so annoying. But seriously I think we just got more attention because everyone else was just starting to filter in. \n* the \""sign\"" for Surrender is this weird light board behind the DJ (who was not so thrilling that night). It looks so ghetto! Very makeshift...\n* drinks are expensive as usual, so please plan accordingly. \n* the dance floor was smaller than I expected, given the general size of the place compared to other clubs\n\nMaybe my star rating will go up if I end up going there again."
4,The Bamboo Club in Scottsdale is still open and was always better than the other locations. The Scottsdale Bamboo is now privately owned by a local family. The menu is similar but offers cheff's specialties as well. The food is consistently awesome. Still upscale casual with the emphasis on casual. Great new energy and run by people who care.
0,Waitress spilled ice cold water on me in first 5 minutes. Drinks from bar were really bad. Had to send the first back. Second still was not good. Took her 10 minutes to make the Greek salads at the table while the other guests food got cold. Bad experience overall. This was Monday.
1,"This Hooters is nothing special. The location is the best thing about it, followed very distantly by the food, and then the servers. \n\nNormally I would NEVER bad mouth the looks of a server, but I reserve the right to with Hooters since they are basically saying in the name \""come here to ogle great looking women\"". I'd say about one out of ten servers is good looking, and one server I had here actually had what looked like a bacterial infection. I really feel bad saying this, but I could be saving someone the energy (I wish someone had done the same for me). \n\nThe food is slightly better than crap, very bland and overpriced. The prices on beer are absolutely ridiculous. \n\nThere are much better places to go on Mill Ave..."
1,"Bad food:( we ordered a plain dosa and veggie combo - the plain dosa was hot came with sambhar and chutneys - sambhar had no salt and was watery,chutneys were watery and cold, I think made few days ago. Veggie combo - had rice, naan, chole, palak paneer, curd and dal. The palak paneer hardly had any paneer - and was firm, chole dal - salt less. Curd - was thin and sour, I think made up few days ago. Not worth the money. \nJust a temporary way to kill hunger. \nReview by an Indian!"
1,"Gross, sketchy, white trash, and filled with drug dealers.\n\nBartender can't make a margarita to save his life."
2,"The last visit left a dog food taste in my mouth and I wasn't eager to come back. We decided to give it another try. \n\nWe got a shrimp bowl and a fish bowl. I'm happy that compared to Chipotle they have more meat, topping and sauce options as it made for a pretty decent bowl. We both liked the fish bowl better which neither of us thought we would (but ordered it because they ran out of shrimp to make two bowls). \n\nI'm open to going to this place again specially since there's healthier options. Seems like there is generally lesser sodium in Zabas food than Chipotle by the taste, but I could be wrong. I've googled around and most nutritional information on this place is incomplete or very general with just a calorie count."
4,"I love this place. I was a member here in 1993 when it only had one tower and was a small gem if a place. We recently came back in 2012 and come regularly now. This is a great place, all the food in here is great. Sportsbook is nice and the casino is nice. My wife and I are reminded of our younger days here and it's so fun. I don't know why it is rated at 3 stars. Come on out an enjoy."
2,"I try to hit the local places first and this isn't bad.  The food is honestly so so, doesn't appear to be fresh but for the price and a local sports bar it will do.  Service is so so as well, again just a average local place but we'll be back regardless.  If the price goes up I wouldn't come back and I honestly only visit once a month.  If the place was better we might make it a regular spot"
2,"When I am craving pizza, I always order a cheese pizza from this place. I have tried the pizza with toppings but be careful how many you have them put on because the crust is so thin and can't hold all the toppings so well. Now if you are a fold your pizza and eat it kind of person, ignore my previous statement! I'm just not a \""fold and eat\"" kind of girl, and prefer cheese pizza anyway. Veggies are cut fresh and the crust is from back east. The garlic knots are so tough and hard they can break a window, I do not recommend wasting your money on them. The \""East Coast Calzone\""  is actually pretty tasty and worth the money. I just ordered it today and really liked it. I asked for a side of sauce and it was really good. My hubby likes a lot of the chain pizzas, but I would prefer this type over them any day. \n\nIf you go to http://www.uppercrustpizza-lasvegas.com/ then you can see the menu and check out what deals and coupons they have going on. I have tried the garlic knots several times and like I mentioned before, I just don't like them (wish I did) however the pizza and calzones hit the spot."
2,"Normally we'd go to CiCi's in Matthews (and I've even reviewed them before, if memory serves).  But lately we've been in the University Area more often, which means we're checking out a different location.\n\nIt used to be that this particular franchise looked a lot different from Matthews, but over time, the Matthews location seems to have been cleaned up with a different look, so I'm thinking that the Matthews location was either purchased by the same franchisee, or was told to bring itself up to certain standards.\n\nIn any case, the University CiCi's is a bit nicer overall, with a single buffet line, instead of two, and the decor is nicer too.  Also, the staff is generally a lot more friendly than in Matthews - rather than just yelling out the typically CiCi's greetings, and sounding like they are getting through their shift, they are actually interested in your well-being.  Or they seem like they are anyway.\n\nThe pizza itself is about the same, but the major different here is that if you don't see what you like - or even if you seem to be having trouble finding something - the staff will offer to make something up and bring it out to you.  This is something that all CiCi's will do, but generally you have to ask for it, and the University CiCi's goes out of their way to do it.  Big thumbs up for that."
2,"Went here yesterday for lunch. Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge. \n\nI overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.  If I am going to get a hamburger and it's not high end then I am an In-N-Out girl because, hey, that's what a hamburger's all about... but I digress. \n\nI went to MTO once before, about six months ago, and remember getting the salmon wrap. Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting. \n\nAs a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of \""cheap\"" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR? Anyway, long story short - okay to try but don't get the salmon burger unless you are in the mood for a patty that has the moisture of the Sahara desert and expect to pay a premium for pretty much anything."
4,"I go this particular sushi place at least a few times a month. The sushi is super fresh, the staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable. I usually order sushi rolls or the ever changing specials that they offer. I have ordered Udon and chicken for the kids and everything we have ordered has been really good. The sushi rolls are HUGE and we always wind up ordering too much. My favorite thing about this place is to sit at the bar and let the sushi chefs create something for me. They ask what I like and then create me an awesome sushi roll that never disappoints. Best part is that my hubby and I can leave stuffed for under $30! Try that at RA!?"
4,"They have the best tasting mexican food out  here in the west valley by far. I'm originally from San Antonio, Texas so my taste buds scream Tex-Mex when it comes to Mexican food. So being stationed here I could not find anything close to home until I came here. The food is so flavorful and delicious I was amazed. It reminded me so much of home. I always leave satisfied. I enjoy everything about this place from the mom and pop hospitality (owners are so sweet, helpful, and friendly), the cheap prices, and once again the delicious food. \n\nSTOP BY, I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! :)"
1,"This was my first time traveling to sun devil stadium for the Washington/ASU football game. The stadium is rundown, bathrooms are old, food could be a lot better. It costs a whopping $8 for a bag of kettle corn. It is also the most unsafest stadium in the PAC 12 in my opinion.There are not handrails at this stadium in the end zone seats. How do you expect my grandmother to make it up those stairs without falling? Awful"
3,"The Great Dane is just as good at Hilldale as it is downtown.  The food is good and the beer is even better.  A good place to meet up with friends or  family, kids are entertained by the darts, pool tables, and shuffleboard."
4,I stopped here for a quick sandwich and coffee. I got the Alloush hot sandwich and the hot Milky Way espresso which were both  phenomenal taste explosions in my mouth. Friendly staff and fair prices. I will most certainly return for another visit!
4,"Damn...who's a sexy bitch?\nMy car is. Right after Perry and his team has spent the entire day detailing it.\n\nWhen I bought a black car, I knew I was in for some high maintenance. But it wasn't until a good friend of mine who's a paint/body specialist referred me to Perry and European Detail after some acidic water leaked on my car after someone power washed the top level of my parking garage. \n\nI thought my paint was ruined for sure! I took it to European Detail (at that time, they were located on Indian School) and not only did they get the acid off, they suggested a GLARE product to protect my paint from further episodes...even bird droppings! The product is amazing and my car looked better than it did brand now. It removed all the small swirl marks/scratches. So from that point forward, I frequented European Detail for basic washes.\n\nWhen they moved their location up to the Scottsdale Airpark, I didn't visit as often.  I hit up a few hand wash places here and there in-between my visits to European...but nothing compares (to you!). It wasn't until recently that my car turned 1yr old, and I treated her to a spa day with a full detail. I am a perfectionist to the core, but I think I found my match with these guys. I couldn't find one thing that was missed or annoying. They treated my leather, steamed carpets, engine, you name it. But the difference between European and others is that there was no chemical smell, my seats/floors weren't soaking wet needing to dry (they use the most amazing techniques and products)...I drove away in heaven.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.\n\nI know that Craig Jackson uses European Detail and trusts Perry and his team to keep his cars in top notch shape, that alone speaks a million words. The knowledge of detailing for the team is an art form, not a quick wash/in-out situation.\n\nShockingly, it's only slightly higher in price than what I've paid previously at these corner \""hand-wash\"" places but the results are 1,000 better.\n\nMy vehicle is not only an investment, but I am proud of it. And when I drive away from European Detail I have no doubt I have even more to be proud of because I got the best service and Auto Detail in the Valley. \n\nWhich reminds me, I need to frequent for in-between washes as well - not just details. Thanks for the great service Perry and Team!"
0,"The place was pretty empty.  Service was friendly.  I ordered a French Dip.  awful awful awful   The dip-I have no clue what it was.  Something was on the bottom and it was clear on top.  It tasted like water that had coloring in it.  The nasty \""swiss cheese?\""  I can assure you that it was not Swiss cheese.  pretty lousy"
2,"Does \""authentic\"" mean \""good\""?\n\nNot necessarily. \n\nI suppose the Comedor is more authentic than a place like Macayo's or Garcia's because they offer such typically Mexican delicacies as tripa and cabeza. They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.\n\nBut as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places. \n\nI had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other \""street tacos\"" that have become more and more popular recently.\n\nThe atmosphere is . . . well. . . \""comedor\"" means \""dining room\"" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.\n\nWe waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.  The place doesn't want for popularity. Aside from the wait, I had no complaints with the service.\n\nSo to the uninitiated, I would go with an open mind, not expecting a life-changing experience. I would also advise people to try the things like the lengua molcajete (a sort of tongue stew served in a lava bowl). The availability of stuff like that is what really sets Comedor apart.\n\nAnd keep in mind that \""authentic\"" doesn't always mean \""good\""."
4,"I absolutely love Grand Lux Cafe!  I normally don't have time to eat at the Cafe and end up getting food from the bakery ( the bakery food is just a good)but obviously not as great at the-sit-down version.  Came here for lunch and I got the pasta and the salad combo.  The pasta itself was huge!  it was suppose to be \"" lunch portion\"" but in my opinion it was the normal dinner size.  I got the telefono pasta. YUM.  The boyfriend got the steak sandwich and it was perfect!!!  Prices were extremely cost efficient considering were in vegas, this lunch was cheap, good and fer-filling.  I packed most of my pasta to-go and ate it as a midnight snack! 5 stars in my books!"
1,"Not only they have bad customer service over the phone..they employees aren't any better...I was helped by a male employe (whose name I don't remember) who treated me as if I was a leper or had a contagious disease. The flotation bath was OK, I can relax in my own bathtub with hot water and Epsom salts ( in the comfort of my own home) and with all the towels I  need. I may not float but I won't be spending a wad of money. I found really crappy that they give you just one towel and nothing to put on the floor after the bath..the floor gets very slippery because the feet are wet with the gooey water...so after the relaxation you may end up falling flat on your tush or even worse, breaking a bone..and in the dark, since the light switch is away from the cabin and cannot be seen...Will I come back to have another \""amazing experience\"" at this spa?......you can guess my answer...."
0,"We walked in around 5 (there were three adults and two kids (4 and 2). There wasn't a single other person in the restaurant. The lady came out and didn't even crack a smile, and in fact, was almost bothered that we were there at all. We tried to \""kill her with kindness\"", but she wasn't having it at all. The refused to give my two year old a place setting because \""he didn't need it\"". We were feeling really uncomfortable and almost begging for a reason to leave, but we felt bad. We hoped the food would be better than the service so far. The server went into the back, yelled at someone back there, and then came back out. She came over to take our order about ten minutes later (we were still the only people in the place). I asked if there was any MSG in the food because I am VERY allergic to it. First she said no, and then changed her answer to, \""well, maybe a little\"". I looked at her puzzled (and annoyed that she easily could have sent me to the hospital). I asked if it was in everything and her response was \""not everything, well, yes, everything\"". Again. Are you serious?! Then, seeming annoyed with us, she sat down at a table near by (like standing for two minutes was just too much) and huffed under her breath. Needless to say, I threw two dollars down on the table to cover my diet coke and we left. I've never done a food review before, but I had to post about this. It was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant EVER. And, the fact that she was not going to be honest about the MSG, really irked me too. Please don't even bother going to this restaurant. We moved in down the street last year and have always been curious about it since we shop at the Frys next door. We obviously won't be back!"
1,"A long time ago, I visited this same chain restaurant up in PA. It was fun, fast and wings are great.\n\nThis restaurant , despite having the same name does not produce the same effect. I think the employees can try a little harder and inject some  energy into the place. Look over at Twin Peaks.. its bright, cheery, energetic.."
1,"TAO Beach needs more water stations for patrons.  With the temperatures soaring, water is certainly a necessity.  I fainted and fell to the ground while waiting in line for water.  I suffered from what appeared to be heat exhaustion.  I commend the staff for helping me up and taking me to the paramedics.  It was a frightening experience, to say the very least."
3,"Ate there for the first time today and was mad at myself for not coming sooner!  I had the pork ribs, fried pickles and kool aid lemonade. The closest meal I have had here in the valley that would compare to real old school ghetto grub, and I mean that as a compliment!!! This joint is the epitome of a gastro pub, hood style. My only complaint, and a given at some of my favorite hood spots around the country - not everything was on the menu. Didn't matter because there are enough favorites to keep you satisfied for days. Shout out to Stacey for bringing real soul food, ghetto gastro pub style to the valley!"
3,"Wow. I'm surprised I hadn't written a review for this place yet. I must be slippin'... Below is my take on the useful-funny-cool of HL.\n\nI was super excited when Hobby Lobby came to Arizona! When I lived in other states, it was my \""go to\"" place for all things creative and decorative from flowers, frames, fabric, and furniture to crafts, scrapbooking, and candles. So I felt especially special when it opened here, just a few miles from my house! Whoopee!\n\n* Home for the Holidays...\nTheir holiday stuff is superb. If you're one of those that likes to decorate for just about EVERY holiday known and unknown to man, you are smart to shop here. (If you're not one of those, be prepared: the store looks like it \""threw up\"" Christmas and Easter when those holidays come around.) Ha!\n\n* Girly Gifts Galore!\nLooking for something dainty and original for that hard-to-please delicate friend or girlfriend? You are smart to shop here.\n\n* Please Pass the \""Parent\"" Projects:\nI come here when I need \""assistance\"" when \""assisting\"" my kids on their school projects (I'm really beginning to hate those elementary school projects - adults are really the ones equipped to create them. Just sayin'.). Hobby Lobby has an array of do-it-yourself kits for - ahem - hobbies! ...Go figure!... I purchased a Volcano Kit to help me - I mean my daughter - create and operate the volcano for a group science project a year ago. They got an \""A\"" on it. Go HL! I am smart to shop here.\n\n* 4 stars instead of 5:\nI agree with previous reviews that the checkout lines are not efficient. Partly why is because they do not scan barcodes. They enter the prices manually for each item. WARNING: Since we - the people of the 21st century - are no longer accustomed to a barcode-less checkout, experiencing manual input of prices, quantities, and discounts may bring on acute irritation, especially when the lines back up. Management says they save their customers money by not converting to the barcode/quick scan system. ... Aight then. Whatever you say, HL. I say, \""Humpf.\"" ... BE ADVISED: when you budget your time to shop here, consider adding on a few more minutes than typical for checking out. \n\n* The Whole is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts:\nThis store is way bigger than its competitors and carries a greater variety of items. During my visits, this location has been well-stocked and relatively clean for a craft super store. They are closed on Sundays so that their employees may spend time with their families. And they carry tons of \""faith-based\"" items for just about everything imaginable. I like that. \n\nIf you're a \""Craft-Head\"" or craft addict, you are smart to shop here.\n\nOn the whole, I'm a fan of Hobby Lobby. Not an addict. But a repeat offender."
1,"I was there with a group of 20 people for hour happy, it was packed at 5pm when I arrived. I sat with my group. It took over 10 mins before I could get our server's attention. After that, every time I needed a refill or anything I need to wait to get her attention. It was a great place to hang out with friends, but not impressed by the service."
3,Sorry to say this folks but I went by Sacks (Indian School & 48th St) today and it is GONE! I can't find any info about the closing online so am hoping that the other locations are still up and running... Really liked this place too!
2,"First time at this restaurant. Went during the long weekend.(Canada Day) There was a Jazz Festival at the time. The lineup was really bad for dinner time. Waited an hour to get a table in the patio. The good thing was that they served drinks while you were waiting in line. The waiter were kind. The food was really good, I had the crispy chicken salad with a side of fries. \n\nOverall, it was an okay restaurant. Would never come back because of the line-up, and the food was alright and the price was alright."
1,"Great, great food!  Potato appetizers have a speical unique kick with the extra added ingredient.  Sundae was amazing.  Burger: delicious.  Mac and cheesy: awesome, but cup of oil in the bottom was hard to swallow!\n\nAs expected, service was a little \""dingy\"".  We waited a REALLY long time to get service initiated.  And when we finally did, the really nice waitress made the mistake of having a side shouting conversation with another waitress across the patio (didn't last long though)???  I know restaurants on the Strip are always busy, and it's probably a high turn-over rate of staff. . . but shouldn't certain etiquette be kinda obvious?  Does it ever cross their mind that they may be serving an entire table of fellow industry folk. . . or better yet. . . .food critics?!\n\nI'd come here again, but I'd expect a long wait"
1,"Eh. We were hard-pressed to find somewhere to grub at 3am after leaving the club, so we settled for PBR. The music was waaaaay too loud and the food was overpriced Applebee's. The waitstaff was super-friendly, though service was painfully slow. Two of our girls fell asleep before their food arrived."
1,"A lot of food, but I wasn't thrilled.  Just not my taste."
3,"This is where my wife and I got married on 3/21/08.  Let me give you guys the rundown.\n\nFirst, the price was pretty darn good--about half of what you would pay at one of the hotel/casinos on the Strip.  They don't have a casino, and that's fine for us.\n\nThe room was a two story unit with a jacuzzi tub halfway up the stairs.  It was like a little apartment and we really loved it.  Room service was fine, but one of the cleaning people took the top off of the complementary bottle of champagne that we were given for our wedding--this was disconcerting.  The hotel replaced it for no charge.\n\nThe one thing that I would not recommend is the restaurant in the lobby.  The menu was pretty monotonous and lacking in variety.  The steak I had was good but fairly fatty.  The vegetables were dry and flavorless, and the \""jasmine rice\"" had no jasmine, only butter.  There was only one server, and service was pretty sparse despite the fact that there were few people in the restaurant at the time.\n\nOverall, we had a wonderful experience at the Alexis Park and will go back.  I just recommend to all people going there:\n\n1.  Watch your stuff\n\nand\n\n2.  Eat somewhere else."
0,"Ok I dont know where to start NASTY !!! Plan is super NASTY seats are super dirty staff is not nice they charge you for everything even water drinks.... bags,check in fee everything crazy you think you paying a cheap fare but you not you paying for check in fee and everything else...... no room in seating area NO WAY I WILL FLY THEM AGAIN !!! Vergin America is the best to fly..... we were just out of time and had to get tickets asap HUGE MISTAKE !!!"
4,Since we haven't been 2 TJ for a few years whenever we're in Vegas we make it a point to stop in and have tacos...  The best freakin tacos I swear
3,"I am going to update my review since the owner sent me a nice little message and explained the reason for the microwaves. I totally respect the amount of work she puts into her food everyday, and I really appreciated that she took the time to explain all of her cooking processes and limitations in her kitchen. I also appreciate how kind she was about it. I have seen posts from owners from other restaurants bashing customers for having an opinon. Its refreshing to see an owner who does the exact opposite. Knowing now that the microwaves are used only to boil water I feel better knowing that what I ate was not cooked in the microwave. I will definaly be back to try out all of your other breakfast dishes!     4/26/11\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI came in here really wanting to love this place. I am always looking for more vegan places to eat because my ultimate goal is to go completely vegan sometime in the near future. We came in at around 8:30 on Saturday morning. That is one thing I have to say about their Saturday hours. Everywhere except their Facebook page says they open at 11 on Saturdays, and even the sign outside of the store says they open at 11, but they actually open at 8 on Saturdays. We might have been the first people in there because of this. And nobody came in after us until about 9:15. Maybe people are confused about the hours? I don't know. But from the reviews on this place I expected it to be jumping. I know every time I go to Pomegranate Cafe this early its packed. So maybe update your website and sign out front? Just a suggestion. \n\nAnyways, so we walked in and ordered. I got the vegan eggs benedict, and my husband got the tofu scramble and one of the smoothies. So we sit down and wait for our food to come out. Now I don't want to be picky, but this is one of the things I notice when I walk into a place. Its small, yes. That doesn't bother me. It just didn't feel clean to me. Most of the tables had stuff all over them and weren't cleaned right. There was dust all over everything. And a giant dead mosquito watched me pretty much my entire breakfast from the window where he was caught in a spiders web. For a place this size, there really shouldn't be any reason why it was a dirty as it was. Maybe that doesn't bother some people, but I was put off by all of the dust. \n\nThe other thing I noticed that really bugged me, is how many times I heard them open and close the microwave. Aren't restaurants supposed to use pots and pans? I don't think I heard the sound of a pot clanging one time. And I have stopped going to restaurants in the past because I found out they use microwaves. If I want to use a microwave, I'll go home and cook myself. I didn't come here to pay ten dollars for breakfast, for it to be made entirely in the microwave. Honestly, I would rather wait an hour for breakfast so it can be made on the stove, than to have it done in ten minutes out of a microwave. \n\nSo after about 15 to 20 minutes our food comes out. It is a lot more than I thought it was going to be. I had two pieces of toast with four pieces of tofu bacon, then topped with two tofu \""eggs\"" with avocado and garlic aoli. It was served with a salad and fresh fruit. The salad was a little odd for breakfast, but it tasted good. I liked the dressing and sunflower seeds. I really liked the eggs benedict. It had a good flavor and even for as much food as it was I ate everything on my plate. My husband also liked his scrambled tofu which came with toast and jam, fresh fruit and two pieces of tofu bacon. For ten dollars you really do get what you pay for. \n\nI really want to come back here because I did like the food, however I don't know that I will knowing how much they do use the microwave. Maybe some people don't care about that, but I do. Perhaps, I will just have to come back and try their raw options. But really, get rid of the microwave!"
3,Definitely a place you visit while in Montreal. Its not as classy or upscale as Wandas or Chez Paree but it still pretty good. Its a full contact strip club. There are some good nights and some bad nights. More locals then any of the saint Catherine spots.
2,"I went in for a facial from a travelzoo deal 39.00 for a facial and parafian wax , Not a bad deal at all It was very relaxing and had a very nice experience there, I booked again I would recomend this place clean and everyone there seemed friendly, I was noticing the people getting there haircut and everyone hair looked amazing when they walked out I never had a haircut from here but I will after seeing many great styles."
0,Breakfast is ok.  Lunch and dinner are horrible.  The food is bland in some cases and plain awful in other cases.   The Stratosphere does a lot of things well.  The Buffett isn't one of them.
1,"you are way way wrong on the prices, you must be filty rich! a cup of nasty-ass Jasmine tea that tastes like sewer water is friggin $6.00. Everything is way way too expensive, this joint is ripping Asians off blind. Although the service is impeccable, and quick, tables are cleaned immediately, and customer service is great, This is what you are paying for!!!!   Lots of 18 and 19year olds standing around the counter to go-orders, lots of older couples cheating on their lovers 'under the radar'  be afraid be very afraid...."
4,This is the BEST shop in town. Emily is amazing. I thought I would go to a little bit cheaper shop and ended up with a crappy tattoo. I crawled back to Emily and she very kindly promised to fix it. She fixed it so well that I ended up getting an amazing lower sleeve that looks like it was done on a TV show all off a tattoo that originally looked horrible. They are worth every penny! I will never go anywhere else.
2,"Classic new Vegas. A must see and Caesar shops are great. Parking is hard though and not easy to access. I have never stayed here so I can't comment on the rooms. \nThe sports book needs some major love though. It is pretty much in a hall, hard to get a seat which are just roped off swivel chairs. The book really needs to readjusted somehow and it is not comfortable or a place I would like to spend much time betting."
2,"I cannot believe all the reviews that list this place as their favorite sushi in town. They are a very average sushi restaurant. I have eaten here on a few occasions, and every time was just mediocre. Their all you can eat menu pricing is very good though. So, if you're one of those people that like very simple rolls, and are not looking for extravagantly delicious specialty rolls or outstanding sauces, this is your best bang for the buck in the area. The quality of the actual fish is pretty good, I think it really comes down to poor menu planning and average chefs."
1,"After 600+ reviews, I'm still going to review it for myself. Firstly, I was royally pissed when we came and was denied seating until our whole party was there. This I would understand if it was busy, or a weekend, or whatever - not a Wednesday morning when more than half the place is empty. So after waiting for our friends we go BACK up and get seated. I was getting the shakes by then bc I needed food so bad and just ordered and waited. Really couldn't care less about the place until I got my food. Ordered an Apple Juice for my drink and it was really good. It tasted like it was freshly pressed. The order came and yes, it was huge, but stop looking at the size people and realize that they put almost 2in high of mashed potatoes under EVERYTHING. Oh, and one thing I wasn't happy about, they don't list what is actually on/in the dish. They didn't mention that it had a type of salsa on top, or that it was on top of mashed potatoes. What if I had an allergy??? Not good!\n\nSo anyway, yes portions were HUGE, but frankly I've had better. Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I won't exactly be rushing to this place anytime soon."
0,"OK, so I go in thinking I'll have a lite breakfast and a little something to drink. \n\nCute place. \n\nI see the chalkboard special , it sounds good and was named after me. \n\nI decided to order the special and an Iced Dirty Chai Soy Latte. \nI am told they are out of some of the ingredients for the breakfast sandwich I wanted.........REALLY? \n\nThan why the Hell is it still on the chalkboard??? \n\nI just stick with the drink then, I watch her make it with a few pumps of the chai syrup? a whole damn lot of vanilla soy milk and a shot of espresso. \n\nI'm glad i passed on the food because after handling my money she proceeded to chop up tomatoes for previous customers order with unwashed bare hands, dirty fingernails and chipped polish to boot! \n\nQuite disgustingly unsanitary if you ask me \n\nAs for my drink ..........to be perfectly honest, and you know I am..........I had a few sips and threw it away, $5 down the drain! \n\nThere was absolutely no hint of chai to be tasted, it was extremely thick with a weird taste and their crushed/shaved ice does not do iced drinks any favors, unless maybe its water. \n\nI'm sorry, but for a place who copied the Starbucks logo into a spoof to put it down better hope they blow the doors off of them, and they DON'T!"
3,"I recently switched health insurance companies to coverage under Health Plan of Nevada HMO plan which pretty much limits me to Southwest Medical Associates (SMA) clinics.  Hearing horror stories about the care received at the clinics around town about poor beside manner and long wait times, I was very apprehensive about my visit to Next Door Health.  I got there about 10 minutes before my appointment time and a medical assistant was out to greet me in about 5 minutes?  She was efficient and seemed to know what to do to get me prepped for the PA.\n\nIn comes my PA Kim.  She was all smiles, warm and friendly - definitely not at all what I was expecting from SMA.  We discussed my problem and the most refreshing part was she educated me about what to expect with my treatment.  Usually at a doctor's visit, I get some medications written up and pretty much get thrown out the door after I have waited an hour+.\n\nConclusion:  Great experience.  Will definitely come back for any future medical visits AND I'll be seeing Kim.  p.s.  They do physicals there, too."
1,"I went here for a baby shower and here is what I found:\n\n1. There were two racket ball walls and four tennis courts.\n2. Large green area in the back of the park away from the streets.\n3. There is a nice walking path\n4. There is a nice playground.\n5.  I caught a strange man walking around all the cars \""shopping.\""  He particularly had a keen interest on my truck and what was in it.  I stood there and looked at him.  It didn't phase him, he proceeded to shop the rest of the vehicles in the parking lot, which included about 6 other cars of my party.  I stood guard and waited for everyone to get their cars while he intently looking to pick something up. Be careful of your vehicles when you park here."
3,"We had heard of Buldogis from fellow yelper Anthony S, but had never made it out there because it was so far from where we live. One random day, Kalila and I found ourselves on that side of town and took advantage of it by finally trying this place out.\n\nMy favorite food is hot dogs, so I definitely had high standards and high expectations.\n\nI ordered the beef buldogi dog and kaliia had the banh mi dog. We also got the chicken wings with a side of asian ginger sauce.\n\nThe beef bulgogi dog was very delicious and flavorful. The meat was tender. The bulgogi mayo was a great compliment to the hot dog.\n\nKalila's banh mi dog was really good as well. The sriracha mayo was perfect for her. Not too spicy and not too mayo-y. The pork belly and banh mi slaw worked well with the hot dog.\n\nThe hot dogs themselves are thick and juicy. Each hot dog is really loaded up with its' toppings so you get your money's worth... if not more.\n\nThe chicken wings were not anything special. I was looking forward to the asian ginger sauce being something similar to the asian zing sauce at buffalo wild wings, but it wasn't even close. The asian ginger sauce was more like an oil and you could barely even taste it. \nSomewhat of a disappointment since their hot dogs were so good that the same amazement couldn't transfer over to the chicken wings, but it's ok. You're not really ever going to go to bulDOGis for chicken wings. You will go and get hooked on their amazing hot dogs.\n\nI just couldn't resist another hot dog. I then ordered the buckeye dog. The corn relish was the business. The bacon was crispy. It was awesome all around.\n\nThey have a large menu and plenty more foods to try.\nAside from the menu behind the counter, they have an additional menu of specials written on a chalkboard wall to the left.\n\nThere are clean restrooms inside (separate men & women, individual use).\n\nThey have 2 tv's and if you ask for the remote, they will allow you to change the channel. We watched the rebels lose to SDSU. Our stomachs were happy, but we left heartbroken.\n\nMUST TRY THIS PLACE."
1,i came to see the ti show. and now i can say i saw it.
1,"Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit."
3,"This In-N-Out is set up just like every other In-N-Out. Walk in and there are you face the counter topped with three cash registered. As you walk forward, the restrooms will be on your right (with the men's on the left and women's on the right should you turn into the alcove) and the seating area will be the entire left of the store. You order, making sure to get a Neapolitan shake with your Double-Double and head to your left to fill up the ketchup tubs (no pickled peppers because this isn't California) before taking a seat on the benches which will be just in front of you. Don't worry about the soda fountain, which will be to your left, along the wall that's adjacent to the drive-thru, as you have a milk shake coming. When they call your order (Number 79, I believe), you go to the counter and find yourself a seat...but you can't have both a window and a booth. Should you want a window seat, you'll have to choose from the hard seats that are set up as two-seater tables, some which are bundled with others. You could eat outside, but this is Arizona, so I wouldn't recommend that. Upon finishing your burger, you should toss the garbage either by the secondary entrance or by the ketchup dispenser.\n\nThat is the restaurant layout and your experience, neither of which ever changes."
4,"Best Sub place I've ever been to! The bread is soft and yummy, the meat warm, the vegetables fresh. I love their BBQ sauce. I always get the Hero- Roast Beef, Ham, and Turkey. YUM-O! Its always busy at lunch time. They ever have Sweet Tea!! Better then Soda any day!! \n\nEveryone is comparing them to Capriottis, but they are two different types of sandwiches! I dont like Capritottis at all. Their sandwiches are too thick that i cant even put it in my mouth. And usually soggy. Firehouse is the perfect amount of meat and vegtable."
2,"Having time to kill before our concert over the weekend, a group of us decided to give Pub 1892 a shot. They offer a happy hour in the bar area every day, but unfortunately there were not seats in the bar area so we just decided to take a booth. They offer all the happy hour drink specials outside the bar, so we were still happy and the menu wasn't too expensive for the quick bite we were hoping for.\n\nWe settled in and decided to share an order of nachos and the lobster corndogs. We got some drinks as well and they were pretty good. The nachos came out quickly and they were enormous. We had every intention on ordering a few more items to share but after the nachos we were pretty full. The lobster corndogs came out and they were ok. My fella and mom didn't enjoy them at all so I ended up having to take the brunt of this dish. It was enjoyable, but pretty greasy.\nDefinitely better to share  most of these dishes. Most of the entrees that came out for neighboring tables were pretty sad looking. Tiny portions and the food didn't look or sound very exciting. The highlights from the menu really seemed to be the appetizers which were on the more creative side as well as the burgers that were a good portion size for the price. \n\nThe pi\u00f1a colada was really the only good cocktail we tried and actually enjoyed, but with an extensive beer assortment, this is the preferable thing  to order here.\n\nI was debating between three and four stars, but based on the food we ordered alone I will stick with three until I give this place another try. I won't go out of my way to try this place again, but it's a solid choice if you're in the area for a show or vacation."
4,"Ignore all the nonsense you'll read in tourist guides about this being \""Edinburgh's Shame\"" as there was no money to finish it when it was built. I think it looks cracking just as it is, and when the light hits it at dusk, there are no eerier or more imposing monuments in Edinburgh. \n\nWhilst it's certainly not Edinburgh's shame, it certainly was my shame that it took me so long to take the walk up Calton Hill to take a look at this monument. I always did think it looked a bit odd and out of place, but only after doing a bit of research for myself did I find out the interesting story behind all that. \n\nIt's also around a ten second walk from one of the most mind-blowing views you ever could see. Fantastic."
0,$20 minimum on delivery. Way too high when considering other delivery options in the area. (In a college town. lol)
4,Honest. Reliable. Trust Worthy.\n\nTim goes above and beyond with his service. He came to my house 3x one day to check everything he could before I ended up towing it to the garage. I will definitely go back!
4,I have driven past this place for years but didn't see it. Tried it today for the first time. If you like really good Chinese food you must eat here. Very nice atmosphere. Excellent service. Some of the best Chinese food we've ever had. Egg Foo young was outstanding. Sizzling beef and scallops was outstanding. Drinks were excellent. My new favorite Chinese restaurant.
1,"Disappointing. The menu is an unfocussed agglomeration of dishes, with no real sense of what they're trying to sell you. The staff didn't seem too interested, either.\n\nOverall, we said: \""Urban Angel has good principles at its heart, and there's a fantastic cafe/restaurant just waiting to emerge, but the thinking behind the elegantly minimalist decor desperately needs to be applied to their menu, at the earliest possible opportunity.\"""
2,Decent but not great.
0,"There is ROT associated with this hotel.  \n\nThe superficial elements are one thing (and they leave much to be desired) - but rather\u00a0I'm talking instead about its management, and some very nasty tactics they  used to tack over a hundred dollars in extra fees onto a PRE-PAID hotel bill.  The whole incident was very \""unkosher,\"" to put it nicely.  (I'd use a harsher term, but I'll refrain here...you can probably imagine.)  I have the backup in writing, so I've taken the matter to my credit card company.  But adding insult to injury, the hotel's Assistant Manager stood back and said \""Not our problem.\"" Such actions should be condemned in the strongest possible terms, if only because they are the precise opposite of hospitality.  Disgusting.  Despicable.  Worth avoiding by staying elsewhere.\n\nIf someone from the hotel were to contact me I can provide additional details, including the names of the individuals in question."
2,"Rita Rudner, the queen of the one-liners, delivered again last night! \n\nMy mom is a HUGE fan of Rita's so for her birthday, I got us VIP tickets to her show. VIP included: meet & greet with Rita, a photo and close seats to the stage. \n\nRita was very sweet and took two photos with everyone. \n\nShe came on stage around 8:40pm and did an hour's worth of comedy. If you don't know her comedy, she talks alot about relationships, the differences between men and women and just everyday funny things. She has a very clean show, which would be good for anyone. \n\nHer delivery is perfect and she has some great talent. \n\nI was a little surprised that it seemed a little rehearsed where some comedians it's like they are just saying the stuff off the top of their head. Ya know? \n\nI agree that a few of her jokes are a little outdated for Vegas standards. (at least the locals can pickup on that kind of stuff) \n\nI was also surprised at the end when she asked if anyone had any questions and no one did. She didn't transition very well from the end of her routine to the question asking. I thought for sure that people would have some questions for her. \n\nAh well. My mom really enjoyed the show and I was happy to take her  to see Rita's show on her birthday!"
2,"First time in Belks and a nice experience. Wish they had more staff on hand to pay for things. I put several things down since I could find no one except a man yelling into his ear piece at another worker, so I left. hint hnt"
0,"So rude! I called the store to ask a question. The clerk put me on hold for 13 minutes! I called back and got a messaging service saying this store was closed. All the clerk had to do was tell me they were closing, and I would've patiently waited to call back tomorrow!"
4,"Perfect hand tossed crust, great service, fresh every time. What else do you need at a lunch place? Perfect!"
3,"I heard great things about this bakery for ages before I made it in myself- and it completely lived up to the hype! From cookies to cakes, truffles and parfaits, this place has everything you could crave and then some. Lots of seasonal goodies are available, like ginger bread men and bonbons decorated to look like Christmas tree ornaments. Store itself is small but makes good use of their limited space.\n\nBonus star for great service: employee heard it was my first visit and pointed out some of her favorite treats, then offered us a sample of their tres leches cake, one of their best-selling items. I'm not a fan of wet cake, and tres leches desserts and I declared a truce long ago... but I wanted to be polite so I tried it. And holy moly, NOW I get the appeal of this dessert! Not to mention she gave us the entire little cup from the display case, rather than the bite on a spoon I was expecting. Decadent!\n\nIn addition to the tres leches cake, the cupcakes are pretty good too (marble cake was especially moist with a fudgy frosting), and the lemon bar was a surprise hit."
4,"Came from Chicago to see our Bears play the Steelers.  I loved the seating, very comfortable and great views of the field.  Nice ushers.  We could go down by the field prior to the game.  No one bothers you as far as the ushers are concerned.   They let you enjoy seeing all the players on the field.  We saw Ashton Kutcher and his girlfriend and many of the coaches, players.  Got plenty of pictures.  The stadiums big screen can be seen from all angles of the park.  We were happy with the ushers, since the Bear fans in some cases were targets. Some fans were very bitter, but the vast majority were gracious.  The Chicago Bears won big and are 3-0, while Pittsburgh is now 0-3, but we are rooting for them in England this upcoming weekend against the Minnesota Vikings!  Go PITTSBURGH!"
1,"Unnecessary frustration.\nRoute made no sense geographically, as admitted by the driver and the dispatcher that I called as soon as I found out that after being picked up in the South Hills of Pittsburgh we were headed back into downtown AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT for 2 additional pick-ups \""add-ons\"" that were last minute after my reservation. The driver was courteous and the 1-800 answered the phone."
1,"Ok so this review is long overdue.  Gaylord's was undoubtedly a so so experience. my fiance and I ate dinner there after a few unlucky hands at the four card table at the Rio.  While it was only around 9ish pm there was one other couple in the restaurant (how weird) When I asked the hostess if we needed to make a reservation.. she kindly replied: no just come in (a light bulb in my thick head should have gone off). After we were seated we ordered the chicken pakoras for me as an appetizer (he's a vegetarian and i'm a pure carnivore) Needless to say yuck/blah/tasteless... Next we ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala and Yellow Dal with something called Bullet Naan.  The PTM was off the chart but the dal... I think I could have made better at home... the naan came out burnt and had to be sent back ( the server was pretty nice about it). All in all I think I should know what indian food should taste like but unfortunately I won't be returning to this mediocre restaurant and blowing my bucks on food thats \""commercialized indian\"". Save yourself the time people and go Origin India or Tamba."
4,"Went here about a month ago, got squeezed in for an appointment right away after calling. Nails are great, they don't rush you, love love love everything here!"
2,"Korea Garden's BBQ is 191873904172x better than Sushi Kim's BBQ.  Since Sushi Kim's bulgogi is sosososo bad, that really isn't saying much.  Korea Garden's bulgogi actually has flavoring, sauce, and is NOT like eating rubber paper.  \n\nThe number of side dishes at Korean Garden is not as plentiful as other Korean restaurants that I have been to.  I cannot complain about that shortcoming because in Pittsburgh, the sample size of Korean Food is '2' .  The beef short rib is a little thick.\n\nI have only taken the food to-go, so I cannot comment on the service.  The hostess who takes my order has always been very courteous, cute, and nice.  Make sure you park legally, as I have seen several tow trucks in the area."
0,"I don't even know what to say.  We never got to eat because the service was so horrible.  The two girls on the floor were more interested in twirling their hair and chatting with another girl (obviously an out of uniform co-worker) than taking care of guests.  The dining room was dirty and tables were in disarray.  When they finally greeted us, they said \""hey guys, no food but drinks are available.\""  When I asked what time they stopped serving she said \""10, but if it's slow we quit making food\"".  Slow?  On a Saturday night?  At 9:30?  Ok, whatever."
0,"Oh Hickory Tavern how you were a big disappointment!  We went here last night as our power went out once we got home from work and needed something for dinner, as well as a place to hang out since the power was estimated to come back on around 9 p.m.\n\nThe inside of Hickory Tavern is nice, but I feel like there are better setups with tables and tvs at other sports bars.  I think it could be a good go to option for watching a sporting event in the bar area, not the dining area.\n\nThe food, this is why you get a star Hickory Tavern.  Plenty of food options, but why bother if it is crap?  I can't speak for it all, but I have no desire to go back because of what I had.  I tried the philly steak sandwich with peppers, onions, and cheese.  The steak was so incredibly bad.  I had a bite or two and was done.  It reminded me of the frozen shaved beef you can find at the grocery store, but with an outdated and old flavor.  It was so bad, I do not think I have had anything as bad as that sandwich.  I would rather force myself to eat brussel sprouts.  Kevin had the fish taco and buffalo chicken taco, just okay.\n\nWould rather drive to another area of Charlotte to go to another sports bar than go back to HT."
3,"Excellent food and amazing service.  Missing a star because my medium rare filet minon came with a warm pink center but my husband's medium rare ribeye came with a cool pink center.  Despite this, however, the meat was first grade, the sauces that accompanied the steaks were amazing, and the ambiance was classy and chic.  We had the early dinner menu which, at $69/person was a steal.  We truffle fries were to die for and my starter burrata salad melted in my mouth."
1,"DO NOT GET YOUR HAIR DONE BY ANDREA!\n\nMy mother made an appointment to come here on the 15th and had problems from the get-go. I called my mom when she was signing in to tell her about a special they were running and the stylist was so rude to my mom when she asked about it, I told my mom to just walk out and not even get her hair done. If I can hear how rude you are through the phone and not even be forced to see the snotty faces you're making then you certainly don't need to be in a customer service position. To my mother's regret she stayed. \n\nI called my mother a couple hours later to see how her cut and color went and she was crying. This \""self-taught stylist\"" turned her hair ORANGE, cut it crooked, used a razor on her fine hair and in other words, DESTROYED HER HAIR. Not only did she destroy her hair but apparently her shift was up and she decided it was time to leave before my mom even had time to come to grips with what she had done. \n\nI told my mom it couldn't be as bad as she thought. Sadly, it was worse than she described. \n\nThe following day she had an appointment with Lauran, the salon manager to try and get it fixed and I went with her. \n\nWOW, Lauren is a miracle worker, after multiple cycles of chemicals and washings the orange was for the most part gone and the cut was...better. The problem with a bad hair cut is there's only so much you can do. Not only did Lauren do a great job with her hair but she was a lovely person as well. Very friendly and VERY patient while my mom kept describing how horrible of an experience she had with Andrea. \n\nI wouldn't let Andrea ever touch my hair and if you don't want to look ridiculous, you shouldn't either. \n\nLauren, however, was AWESOME!!"
4,"This place s absolutely amazing! \nThis is the first Thomas Keller restaurants  that I have been to. First of all , I was incredibly peeved that I had to wait for 45 minutes for brunch but boy was it worth the wait. \nThe hostess sat us an outside table overlooking the Venetian Pool and our server was incredibly attentive. The brunch menu looked amazing and I was having a hard time making a decision of what I wanted to eat. But then I asked our waiter what he recommended  on the menu, he said Chicken and waffles . Now I only had fried chicken and waffles before ,not roasted chicken so it was interesting to try it. To my surprise, it was amazingly well executed. \nNot only the food was amazing, the service was exceptional. Our waiter was attentive and ave us an insight to work for Thomas Keller.\nBecause of the food and the conversation it makes this a must try for Las Vegas! \nAnd now my husband and I must try his other restaurant , French Laundry!"
4,"Was in town for work and stopped in to check out the sample sale. I have a couple functions coming up and thought it would be worth it to take a look. I had the best luck!  Kendra was so helpful and picked out some great things for me to try. I found two gorgeous dresses, very reasonably priced."
0,"I \""Yelp\"" everything, but for some reason, I did not think to review a rental car agency, MY BAD! The agent there acted friendly, but after all was said and done, her friendly veneer faded away. She pushed every extra charge she could try to sell on me. She was purposely wasting my time, because she was angry that I wouldn't bite at any of her offers, so she kept pushing. Mind you that I recently had an operation, so I was in a wheelchair, and it was hard to stand up for long periods of time, but she didn't care. When she handed me the contract to sign, the amount of the rental, was literally double the price that I had pre-booked on the internet. I asked her why, and she said that adding an additional driver added money (it never did at any of the other places I rented from), and that the internet price did not include taxes. So, I fished out a copy of the confirmation page from the internet, and showed her that the price I arranged, said that the taxes were already added in the price I had booked. Then I saw her face get agitated, and she was shaking slightly as she had to re-do my contract. She was MAD as heck. They keep telling you to check the car carefully, which made me worry even more, and you cannot even see inside of the garage (as another reviewer mentioned) to see if there is any damage before you drive off. It is way too dark inside to see any dings, or small windshield chips, so I wrote that in the comments section of the rental slip. This place is shady!!! Avoid at all costs. Now I am concerned about getting my deposit back, because of the other reviews here on Yelp. I WILL NEVER RENT FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!"
3,"I got a Groupon here in May and figured I would use it when traveling to Vegas. Driving here wasn't too bad and finding the place was pretty easy as it is located in a shopping center. Our Groupon was $10 for $25 so we got a medium Villa Special pizza for like $15, chicken wings for $6, fries for $3, and a drink for $3. Total was like $4 with the Groupon.\n\nThe place was pretty clean and had a lot of seating area. The World Cup was showing at this location which was kind of cool. They have 3 TVs there to watch the game. I did see signs for beer specials that was 5 for $10.  \n\nThe Chicken wings were the best. It was crunchy just the way I like it and very flavorful. The fries was good but nothing too special about that. The pizza was pretty good too. I like my pizza with flavors of the sauce that is tangy with a kick. The meat was good I think I must have ate 4 pieces since it was that good. \n\nAll in all a good place to go to just eat or watch the game. I would definitely go back again for their wings."
3,"I've never eaten such a wonderful cookie, whenever I go to  Abington, MA  at least twice have to go there, and is always the last to bring both to Brazil. Tasty, with plenty of chocolate chips. Once we had to eat it with a spoon, it was warm, melting, and departed to catch him. The attendants also very friendly. Brought a lot of them little cards to display them as mandatory for anyone who appreciates a beautiful sweet passage."
3,"Scored my whole Jem costume here, out of used clothes!\nIt's a little \""lower rent\"" than Savers, the quality is not quite as nice and the organization is...well..abysmal, but if you have the patience to search for things your size, you may find some real gems in there :D\n\nPS: they seem to have discount days a lot : bring in your Albertsons receipt and get 25% off...teachers and students discount days, military ID days. call em and ask!"
2,"Was the Debbie Reynolds and others prior to becoming the Greek Isles then Clarion.  The exterior is a little shabby, but the rooms are quite nice.  No king bed?  Mine had one, and every room has a small fridge, microwave and LCD tv.  I had to spend some time acrosss the street at the Hilton and, for a lot less money, I thought the room at the Clarion was nicer.\n\nHad dinner tonight (Sunday) in the Bistro Restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service.  The ribeye steak was nicely done, the scampi style shrimp and asparagus perfect.  Although the chef's idea of medium was somewhat different than mine, it did not justify sending the good sized steak back.  However, I am not sure I would partake of the buffet breakfast again.  Ten bucks gets you your choice of scrambled eggs, some kind of wierd looking quiche thing, dry pancakes, sausage patties, bacon, fruit and juice or coffee.  Micky D's a few blocks north on Paradise is where I will be going tomorrow.  \n\nI don't understand the comment about the parking permit and lack of front desk staff.  I was never told a permit was necessary, there is plenty of parking, both covered and uncovered and you may park wherever you want.  My room was on the south side, so at night I parked my car on the upper level so I could keep an eye on it.  During the day it stayed cool in the shade of the first and second levels.  When I checked in Friday afternoon there were two clerks staffing the front desk and there was no wait.\n\nOne of the things I really liked about the Clarion was not having to navigate through miles of smoke filled casino to get to the front desk and elevators.  Sure, there might be a little smoke from a person in the lobby or casino, but, unlike Circus Circus where I last stayed in Vegas this was, you should pardon the pun, a breath of fresh air.\n\nIs the Clarion where you want to stay to impress your new hot girlfriend on your first trip to Vegas?  Maybe not.  But, if you are there on business and need a clean, comfortable room at a reasonable price, I would recommend it."
2,"It's subway. I'm not really sure what else to say. But it's near my office and when I forget lunch, and don't want anything the cafeteria has to offer and I'm on a limited time budget this place wins every time. \n\nOnly downfall is that if you go directly at noon, you're gonna be in line for awhile, due to the office folk. Go a little early or a little late and you'll be good to go."
2,"Finally, a decent Asian market north of Glendale. There used to be a huge Vietnamese community centered around 19Th ave and Northern.  I wondered where a lot of the businesses had moved to... Well, now I know.  There are a ton of good resources and restaurants north of ASU West and up to the freeway (101) Asiana Market is one of the biggest.\n\nThis Korean owned market has a good selection of Korean, Vietnamese and Indian foods.  I found a lot of things I have trouble finding elsewhere.    The shelves were packed, and the prices were good.  I bought a good sized bag of wild sweet rice for less than $4. The selection of fish was good, the fish looked very fresh, and it was clean well organized.  I would like to have seen more baked goods.  I couldn't find the kind of fish cake i really wanted, but there were 3 other suitable choices.  I did find 4 things i hadn't expected to find.  The Indian spice aisle was particularly tempting."
2,"One of the dissenters here, but I truly didn't feel the \""love\"".\n\nIt isn't that great of a Cirque show.  I suppose I may have just been disappointed since everyone we know who has seen the show has raved about it.  Plus the seats actually sucked - quite narrow and minimal legroom.\n\nOf the 3 Cirque shows I've been to, this is the weakest in terms of set, acrobatics, etc... It's quite a different setup compared to the others where you're essentially seated around a stage (more like a stadium seating) rather than facing the front.  There's not really any bad seats, but you get the advantage of seeing the facial expressions and details better in the pricier seats.\n\nIf you're there for just the music and are a Beatles fan, you'll love it.  It's pretty catchy and entertaining but I thought it was pretty average for value.  I'm definitely glad we got these at 25% off.  I was much mroe impressed with Mystere and KA."
3,My first cheesecake factory experience. It's beautiful design and friendly staff added to the delicious meal and incredible cheesecake. The staff was on the ball. We had an enjoyable time. Couldn't eat all the cheesecake... great treat later!
3,"Ok, first off this review is written after I have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions. Probably 4 or 5 times. I got a great rate for a standard room on getaroom.com. When I checked in I was given the keys to room 2109 in the Central Tower, which is what I paid for, standard. When I got up to my room, I was thoroughly disappointed, It was one of the older rooms that had not been upgraded. I tried to talk myself into toughing it out, but after about 15 minutes I decided I couldn't take it. I went back downstairs and got an upgraded room for an additional $ 20 a night and it was well worth it. The upgraded rooms are par for the course for a Las Vegas 4 star hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean and it has a number of restaurants to choose from. It's only a block away from the Strip and is a very comfortable stay. When you book, avoid booking just a standard room and if you get room 2109 in the Central Tower immediately ask for an upgraded room. If you don't, you might seriously consider suicide, lol."
3,"Friendly staff, prompt service. I love the fact that it's cats only,  nothing freaks out kitty more than the smell of dog when he's locked up in a box. \n\nWhat I really love about this place, and I don't know if this is just normal in Vegas, but it seemed so bloody reasonable. I moved here from San Francisco, and I was never able to get out of the vets office there without sacrificing a full paycheck. They always used to sneak something else on the bill too, like a full exam when you're only there for a booster shot. This is standard practice in SF.  \n\nAt All About Cats, I took the baby in for a bunch of shots, full exam, and parasite test. The total bill was only double digits. I was absolutely shocked. I could actually afford the medical care for my kitty.  When I went back for his booster shot, they threw in a follow up exam for free. As a bonus, they offer the recombinant vaccines which are supposedly safer for cats than the killed virus vaccines which are standard at most clinics.  All in all, it's a nice clinic, and they give kitty toys to play with while he waits for the doctor."
4,This place is great. The ambience is very casual the prices are very low. The menudo is well worth your time. All you can eat for only six dollars.
1,"My boyfriend and I went for the all you can eat (aka 10 tacos) night.  He of course ate all 10. \n\n I wanted to like Loco Lime, I really did.  I love supporting neighborhood restaurants but I just wasn't all that impressed.  The only thing with any flavour is the salsa verde.  I didn't like the soft taco shells, there was something bizarrely sweet about them that I wasn't a fan of.  We tried the barbacoa, carne molida and shredded chicken, which were fine but just not anything special.  Loco Lime really is only Mexican inspired.  Fine for people who don't like real spicy Mexican food but not for those of us who love wet burritos and flaming hot salsa."
1,"Another experience so upsetting it warranted a 2 star review. I went in ordered my choc chip bagel with plain cream cheese and sat down hoping to enjoy my Saturday morning. Took a few bites of my  choc chip bagel and realized something was missing, CHOCOLATE CHIPS!!!!!!! After tearing the bagel into sections, (in order to see if i had gone insane) I brought my order back to the young guy at the counter and explained the error on their behalf. \n\nThis is were it became truly infuriating, he looked at the sections of chocolate chip-less bagel and tried to LIE TO MY FACE about how the chips get mixed in with the batter and somehow dissipate into invisible  bagel oblivion. Insulting the intelligence of your customers is a cardinal sin in my book. If he had just owned up to it and been a man about his mistake, this review would have been drastically different. \n\nI am willing to try this place again and retract my low score, but it better be damn good bagel or i'm going back to Einstein's."
0,"This place is stuck on stupid. No one knows when the store manager works. Really? Attitude when you complain about poor quality products? Oh, I get it. You got my $4,000.00 bucks, so I'm screwed. I'll pay, not because I'm worried about my credit rating, but because I am a person of integrity. Maybe you should hire people like me. Rest assured you will not get another dime from me after this transaction."
0,"It's a pretty place with the plants and twinkly lights and the managers were nice, but I would never go back there nor would I recommend it to anyone. The waitress was very rude about my request for a meat-free meal. She claimed they could not make any substitutions, including my request for my meal to be of the healthier variety, which was an option listed on their menu (\""spa mex,\"" I think they call it). We got a new waiter, who was happy to accommodate me with a meatless burrito. Unfortunately it was no good. It was soggy, lukewarm zucchini inside a soggy, lukewarm cabbage leaf. The whole thing was watery with no substance and little taste. In addition, our meal took at least 45 minutes to arrive, despite it being a half full Wednesday evening, and it was so dark in the eating area we could not see our food. The managers tried to be extra nice after our first waitress was rude, but it really made the whole thing uncomfortable and awkward."
1,"Yay! Tiggo's, you capped off a night of watching the Suns game by actually running me out before it ended. I don't remember the last time I've not watched a game in its entirety. You make me want to watch at home because it is becoming apparent that downtown Phoenix sports bars are awful.\n\nPlease hire a bartender that knows what she is doing. You can put any cute, slightly over face painted girl behind the bar and have her get drinks and push buttons. It's just that some take a lot longer to do things. The bar was full to capacity and she was moving at the same speed I would move if mom asked me to take out the trash when I was 12. She had trouble opening bottles of coors light with a bottle opener, couldn't find the buttons she wanted on the POS screen, and generally wasn't good at her job. \n\nTheir saving grace from getting one star is they have $2.50 coors lights. Yeah yeah, I drink shitty beer. Eat one if you have a problem with that, lol. I finally had to leave because after two beers I had to pee so bad and their restroom was under standing liquid, not sure what kind, but I wasn't about to walk in it."
4,"Recently dined here and absolutely LOVED it! The waitress was extremely nice and got our order perfect. We had a big group and had several appitizers and food. Pricing was great for as much as we got! Walked away Fat, Dumb and Happy. The owner was really nice and made sure to walk around to each table to make sure everyone was happy. We will make several trips back! Thanks Manny's!!"
1,I love the food truck scene here in Montreal but I think there are better ways to discover it than at this event.  There are 40 trucks to choose from and the well-known ones always make an appearance.  That being said the more popular food trucks have crazy line-ups.  Last time I went Au Pied de Cochon had a two hour wait just to give you an idea.  I imagine most of those people were waiting to get there hands on a coveted foie gras poutine only to be disappointed as they ran out of that item.   Food Truck Fridays can quickly turn into a zoo with all the people who show up and just navigating the crowds can be unpleasant.\n\nWhile the event technically runs until 11 don't show up late because by then a lot of the trucks' offerings are gone and they're closing up.   In fact you're best off showing up as close to the beginning as possible.  By dinner time the place is packed and the line-ups have reached the insane level.\n\nThe idea is smart but I think the event has simply become too popular.  You're probably better off finding other opportunities to try the many food trucks the city has to offer.
0,"Ah, crap.  Ah, Sh*t.  Sin?  Too light of a term.  \n\nSushi coming from the 7/11 convenience store?  Yes.  Really?  Really?  \n\nThe poor avocados in the \""bagel roll\"" were trying to tell us that they are not actually in a sushi roll.  Someone plumped some rice together a few years back, then plopped the avocado in the middle a coupla' nights ago on our table.  The rude waiter couldn't be nice, so the avocados won the \""nice\"" award for this restaurant for trying to warn us of the fact that THIS PLACE SUCKS!   \n\nIf you want a 'white elephant' gift-like restaurant experience, where the wrapping looks PHENOMENAL but the gift should be thrown in the city dump, go here.  Otherwise, don't waste your time, money or dignity.\n\nAh, Sin...get a clue and start serving freshly made sushi, and make sure your \""orange chicken\"" doesn't look like something you popped out of a freezer box, and put in a tanning bed for 20 minutes.  Get better at your food and friendlier staff, and the people on here won't keep complaining."
2,They gave us a deal 30$ for one hr massage. But i didnt think my masseuse knew what he was doing. Overall i was relaxed and it was cheap. I would still look for a better place to get relaxed though.
4,"It IS in the Sante Fe Hotel, however, it feels like you're in a sexy restaurant on the strip.  The atmosphere is perfect for those with a sophisticated palate, but lacks the loud music, and obnoxious attitudes... If I lived in North Las Vegas, I would love having this place close by without having to drive into town.\n\nNow onto the drinks.  Pretty great wine list with everything from Stags Leap to Cakebread at prices you would expect to pay at a steak house. Had martini's at a prior visit that were excellent.\n\nLOVE the lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and filet mignon.  The 12 oz was enough to split with a girlfriend!\n\nYou can make it work on $50-$75 per person plus tip depending on how hungry you are."
3,"Im so glad we yelped this place before we left Vegas. \n\nWe were all pretty much grungy but so were the rest of the people there.. haha. Im sure the owners know why.. it is like five mins away from the strip.. \n\nAnyways! Super friendly owner lady!! She was willing to give us more of other things cuz none of us wanted meatballs. Yay! even though she forgot and messed up my friend's order.. \n\nTasted \""authentic.\"" I put that in quotes because I'm not sure what authentic pho tastes like really but it was different from the regular Korean owned places I'm used to. In any case, even though I prefer Korean owned places I thoroughly enjoyed the pho here. It may have been cuz I was slightly hungover.. but still.. when else would you come here right? (As a non Las Vegas resident). :)) \n\nThe only thing I was a little errrr about was the fact that you have to walk pass the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Eek. I don't like that.. :(("
2,"It's the only movie theater in Surprise, that alone is a plus! \nTuesdays & Thursdays ALL movies are $5.50 ALL day. \nThe first show for each movie is always $5.50. \nSeats are comfortable, sound is good. \n\nI couldn't give it more than 3 stars because concession prices are pretty ridiculous, but I guess they are everywhere. \nI try not to visit after 5 pm because this seems to be a hangout place for local kids who can't help but giggle, talk & do anything but actually watch the movie in peace."
1,"The food was nothing more than mediocre for the price. Mediocre ribs (on the dry side), ginormous portions, and big prices to match. Tastes like a chain! And you pay for the theme.\n\nCan be decent for a gathering of the masses to watch a game, or a large party. Otherwise, I'd pass."
1,"For a place with \""Burger\"" in the name, I set my expectations rather high for the burgers.   Boy was I disappointed, I had the \""all good burger\"" what a misnomer.  The two stars are for the wait staff alone - otherwise this joint gets zero stars in my book."
3,"Bellagio or Wynn...that is the question. We decided to go to the Wynn Buffet (we were staying at the Trump, across the road).\nI think the trick is to a little bit off peak, for a couple of reasons:\n1. - The wait is not very long if you are not there at 7 or 8 in the evening...we hit the buffet at about 6:15 and waited less than 10 minutes, and;\n2. - I think everything is less picked over and fresher when it's a little less crowded.\nOK, it's a buffet, but a really terrific buffet, with cocktails and the whole deal!\nThe selection is awe inspiring, from the fish to the steaks to the pasta and salads to the dessert, cheeses and everything in between. Really magnificent and the chefs do a great job of preparing everything well and keeping new dishes coming out hot (or cold if required) and on time.\nI know, for $75-80 for a buffet, it should be terrific...it is. I only wish I could eat more."
2,"Having lived in Texas, we are continually on the hunt for great Mexican food. Sadly, we will have to continue hunting. All 3 of us had their fajitas, and we were all dissapointed. Both the chicken and beef were bland, the onions and green peppers over cooked with strong butter flavor, and the beans were not \""tasty\"". Why the 3 stars then? Well, they are doing the tortilla shells correctly. Freshly made, and very good. Its a start. And their chips were great, and service prompt and friendly. Hopefully they improve everything else...(along with their marg prices. $14 for a reg size. Really?)"
1,"$30 hookah, meh service...and it was completely dead when we went. The saving grace? Really great cocktails. Bottoms up!"
3,I have been going to this particular Firestone for several years and always get really great service here. I never feel like they are trying to get me to buy things that my car doesn't need. Often I just go in for an oil change and am out with no mention of anything else that I probably don't need. I feel they are thorough and knowledgable when it comes to my car. I've also purchased tires here and had really great service. They didn't have the tire that I needed so they gave me a more expensive one that was in stock for the same price as the cheaper one. I even mentioned that I had a coupon that I forgot to bring and they just included it without actually having it with me. Great guys who are always respectful.
1,Decent food. Server neglected us when we didn't order alcohol. No free chips and salsa. Good portions. Liked the chicken enchiladas. Overpriced but could be worse for a strip restraunt. Kinda hidden and small. Made a nice lunch. Lots of light and color in the decor.
4,"Wow.  Heard about this place from a friend at my last job, but didn't go for a couple months.  Hit it on Friday with my girlfriend.  I'm angry at myself for waiting that long.\nLet me start with the food.  They start you with chips and salsa.  Chips are good quality chips, cooked until perfectly crunchy.  The salsa on the other hand, is out of this world.  It is seriously some of the best salsa I've ever tasted.  I basically filled up on it before my food even came.  I regret this decision.\nI ordered the Pollo Asada.  Chicken was perfectly grilled, veggies on it were delicious, and their Spanish Rice is great.  There were carrots in the veggie slaw they gave me.  I hate carrots.  The slaw was still delicious.  I do not quite comprehend this myself, but it was great.\nGirlfriend went for the Veggie Burrito.  Not only did they remember no sourcream when she forgot (she asked about other dairy items, so they understood she didn't eat dairy), but they subbed the rice too since the rice that came with it standard had dairy.  She said it was absolutely delicious, and a truly unique vegetarian burrito.\nThe server was a truly nice happy guy, they were quick to refill my water, or ask if we wanted more chips (if you see above, maybe too quick), and again just all around nice no matter who went by the table.\nFinally, we both ate for just over $20 before tip.  So, yeah, great value for your buck here.  I cannot recommend it enough."
0,"If you know exactly what you want and don't need to speak to anybody then MAYBE go here. I have been in twice and on both occasions left an armful of goods behind that I had selected because of my inability to get anybody to help me with other articles. The staff seem to go out of their way to avoid you. The place is totally understaffed. You have to beg for help and then get a nasty look for interrupting a conversation with another staff member. If you need help with Bike accessories - FORGET IT. They have a so called bike specialist who both times was not in and nobody else in the store knows a thing. The line I was given is that they are trying to find staff. Are you kidding me, in this recession you can't find good people!! The best was when asked upon leaving the last time if I found everything I was looking for and saying, \""No there was nobody to help me\"", the answer I got was \""Okay\"". They don't give a darn about customer service and don't deserve your business.  \n\nThe worst part is that seems to be a common theme if you look at the reviews for other stores. BTW both times I was one of only 2-3 customers in the store."
1,"Service was good, and the place is definitely plenty nice for a chain.  That said, the pizza isn't very good."
1,"You can practically smell the Abercrombie and Fitch cologne and hear the sound of collars popping as you enter this place. Douche central.\n\nFood was decent, but it took 15 minutes for them to make 3 sliders to go. They advertise these fancy dipping sauces but they were out of everything except ketchup -- how exotic. Prices are also outrageous -- $14 for 3 tiny sliders and a small fry.\n\nI will definitely not go back."
3,"I just edited the biz info as this is the old address and didn't have hours and stuff site url and stuff.\n\nI like Cycle Gear... and here's why...  They're WAY cooler and much nicer than the guys at Ride Now and cheaper.  Like anything you should shop around but they give discounts to military and PD/FD so works for me there.\n\nThey have pretty good deals on tires honestly, and bring the old wheel/tyre in and they'll mount the new one for you.\n\nI had a jacket that was, about a month later I just decided it was too big and I didn't want it anymore... they took it back and special ordered me a new one.  Later I bought a Dianese Santa Monica jacket on sale that was much cheaper than anywhere else had it.\n\nThe guys there are all riders and very knowledgeable with any question I've ever asked them.  Always a good convo anyways when I go in there.  Brought the girl in and she got her jacket there too.\n\nAnd they do street and dirt gear too btw."
2,"Je suis tomb\u00e9e sous le charme des Tontons Flingueurs principalement pour son d\u00e9cor, ce style petit bistro \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise et r\u00e9tro me fait sourire! L'ornement et les chaises en bois, les tabourets au comptoir, les photos en noir et blanc, le tout accompagn\u00e9 d'un fond de musique fait en sorte qu'on a l'impression de voyager dans le temps! \n\nPour ce qui est de la nourriture maintenant, j' ai test\u00e9 deux fois leurs cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surprise, c'\u00e9tait bien bon!

0,"I'm not a member of a gym but I wanted to take a look around and see what this one had to offer. When I asked the girl behind the counter if I could look at what they have she would not let me go in without filling out a bunch of BS paperwork. I'm sure it was so that some guy could walk me around, waste my very precious time talking about things I already know, and try to persuade me to join their gym. That's not what I wanted. I already had my decision made that if I saw the equipment I wanted to use that I would go ahead & join. I just wanted to run in & out quickly while I had a free minute to do so and check it out. Oh well, I figure I just saved myself some time and money with this place. I used to be with LA Fitness. They are wonderful! I think I may check out the Gilbert Rec Center & see what they have. I'm sure they won't mind me taking a look. If not, I'll head back to LA which I highly recommend."
3,Great breakfast!! I love their vegetarian eggs Benedict & pumpkin pancakes. The food is fresh & very good at Kelly O's. Service & prices are good and food comes out fast even though they are very busy. Free parking in their parking lot which is a huge plus for going down to the Strip District. Definitely recommend eating here for breakfast.
0,"Try ran out of champagne for the $0.10 mimosa refills. As a result of this they told us they would comp us a round of drinks. The service was extremely slow and when the bill finally came they did not comp the drinks they said they would and added 20% gratuity for our party of six. We asked to speak to a manager and no one ever came except the server. I don't have a problem with gratuity included, however if you're going to add 20% to the bill I expect speedy service and a manager to come to our table when requested."
4,"I'm not much of an opera buff, but I was really \""wow'd\"" when I saw this.  Great acting, singing, really cool custom theater, we had really great seats also.  We got a good discount on our tickets through travelzoo's promotion, only ended up paying about $70 per ticket for really great seats.  \n\nI'd recommend watching this even if you've seen Phantom already.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but it was hilarious when I heard people scream during the \""Chandelier\"" part."
0,"Don't bother ordering a car from this place if you want good service.  Absolutely no communication, poorly trained sales staff, and no consistent answers among staff.  Each person tells you something different.  If you are looking for a good sales experience don't waste your time at Mini of Tempe.  Mini Scottsdale appears to have a much more knowledgeable staff . . . or better yet go out of state."
3,"My first apartment in Phx was at Van Buren and 52nd streets. I'd come from a village of 500+ people and was in awe of city living. There I was, in the fifth largest city in the US, living on the same street made notorious by hookers and drug deals. Oddly enough, it was on the corner that I met my BFF, at the bus stop. But there's quite a bit more to that corner--Nu Towne Saloon. \n\nBack in the early 2000s, Daddy Ron ran the place and it was a den of devilish sins. Cheap beer in a smoke-filled environment called out to the horny, the lonely and the drunks. You could bet that I'd be there every Sunday for their beer busts and a few night during the week. I used to hop the fence in the parking lot to my apartment when I was too drunk to walk all the way around. And if I happened to rub up against you inappropriately back in the day, I'm blaming the dim lighting.\n\nBut now, I live in CenPho and rarely venture to my old stomping grounds. However, my BFF and I went to the swap meet at the greyhound track yesterday and I thought it would be therapeutic to drive by our old places and appreciate how our lives have turned out. This trip down memory lane included a visit to Nu Towne. A lot has changed in the past few years. That dirt overflow parking lot to the west of the bar is apartments now, and there's a street that runs along side of that. Daddy Ron is now at the Eagle (cum Retro Bar). Gone is that dark cavernous bar with the beer-sticky floors. Today, Nu Towne has undergone a metamorphosis into a swanky saloon. Natural light brightens the bar through two new windows. And existing window openings have been reclaimed. The restrooms are also bright and clean. The color scheme is decidedly more serene, the truck is gone, two new pool tables replaced to former ones with mystery stains of unknown origins and are spaced on either end of the bar, and flat-panel TVs add another layer of freshness. Although I'm not one to get excited about such things, they even have Wii events. \n\nSo, Nu Towne has transformed from that \""It'll be our little secret\"" bar to a \""Yeah, and I don't even cringe when I see my dad here\"" bar. Go. Check it out. If you were here before return to see how much it's changed. If you've never been, give it a go. Don't be concerned if the parking lot isn't full--the neighbors at the apartments walk over there and can be found both inside and out of the patio."
3,"I went here tonight with the BF as we had a groupon. We ordered soo much dessert for 10$! We got espresso and creme brulee gelato which was excellent! They had a lot of flavor and was creamy and delicious. We shared a latte which came in a real glass (a clear glass glass) and was beautiful. It had a few cookies on the side and came on a cute little plate. The only thing that we weren't huge fans of was the tiramisu. I was especially excited for it, but wasn't a huge fan. Overall, the service was friendly and the gelato and coffee was good, so it deserves 4 stars."
2,"I can't really knock the place but nothing really jumps out and says amazing either. \n\nI have been here multiple times, often for sporting events. The food is good but not fantastic, however it is better than most sports bars. I have had the shepherds pie a few times and I like it. It's a full meal and exactly what you want in a shepherds pie, nothing fancy just the simple classic meal. I have also had the spinach artichoke dip which is pretty much your standard spinach artichoke dip.\n\nThe one of the big things that has this at a 3 star not a 4 star is the lack of pitchers of beer. It's insane that a sports bar doesn't do pitchers of beer. Also during PPV's they don't do any free refills on soda, I really think they should give at least 1 if not 2. Service here has been fair at best. Some have been above average but most have been average at best. I understand it can be busy during sports events but even when there hasn't been anything they haven't been fantastic."
4,"I heart Tokyo Express. I have been coming here ever since I was a little girl, when I would come to work with my parents. Now that I am a big girl, I still come here about twice a month for lunch, sometimes 3-4.\n\nI always order the same thing, teriyaki lite bowl with egg rolls. But today I decided to switch it up & I ordered bento box a. It was ok, the best parts were the teriyaki chicken & eggroll so I think I will just stick to my usual.\n\nThe 2 girls up front who take orders are always smiling & super sweet. I have never had to wait more than 5 mins for my order.\n\nLike I said, I heart Tokyo Express!"
1,"I went in for the iPhone 6.  They had one for the size and memory I desired, which was fantastic. However, I waited 32 minutes to be seen. Additionally, there was a certain level of pushiness to use their insurance and buy their bundle of accessories in that moment. The exact case that I was sold for 34.99 (which was supposed to be discounted) was also being sold on Amazon for 9.99 (shipping included). Therefore, one critique would be the inflated prices of their accessories. Further, the screen protector that I was sold was not put on correctly and I had to return to the store several days later to get it fixed. The charger that was included in the bundle is of a ridiculously cheap (but not inexpensive) quality once you do some research on it. I did not appreciate the forceful nature of encouraging me to buy a bundle that could not be returned. Although they are following their policy, I did not appreciate what that policy entailed. Therefore, this place was good for the stock that they had, but their customer service has a lot to be desired. Make sure you know exactly what you want (phone and accessory wise) when you go there and stick to your plan."
1,"Regardless of the fact that its basically a glorified Holiday Inn with a million blinking white lights, bad food and a pretty dismal, smoky casino, I shouldn't have to add this 1000-room hotel crowning the foot of Fremont Street as a business listing on Yelp.  Fremont Street gets no love at all.  Granted, its certainly not a class act or anything, but it was the shooting location for many of the scenes in the movie \""Casino\""."
4,"We rarely go out to breakfast but I love to do so and the menu caused my husband to remark that we'll have to come back because there are so many things he wants to try! Yay!\n\nI had an omelet (yummy) which I easily shared with my two kids: ages 2 and 4, and still had some leftover. I appreciated that our server suggested sharing, as opposed to swindling us into kids meals instead (though well have to get the Mickey pancakes next time just because they looked fun and yummy). My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he said it was fantastic. The orange juice was generous and fresh squeezed and omg the hashbrowns?? Even if the rest of the food was horrible I'd be coming back for the hashbrowns. Best I've ever had, ever. My potato hating husband even devoured them. \nThe owner, or person I assumed was the owner, was very present. He was helpful working with his staff by clearing plates and also making the rounds to check in with guests. Super nice guy!\n\nKid friendly, delicious, great vibe, we'll be back!"
2,"nice view, good service"
2,"Oh gosh..I am such a tourist. Or maybe I'm just really lame?\n\nEither way I was in Vegas on Saturday and like many other Californians..I've been to Vegas tons of times before. I always want to make each trip a little different by trying something new or going somewhere I haven't been.\n\nThat's when it hit me: Pawn Stars!\nI knew that Rick, Chumlee, and the gang were sitting in a pawn shop somewhere not to far from the strip.\n\nNot going to lie..like every other person I was tricked by Hollywood.\nFirst, there was a line to get into the pawn shop. I'm sorry...is this Disneyland? I've heard if you do at bad times the shop will be closed despite the 24 hour sign hanging above.\nSecond, no one I recognized from the show was there. I should have known...\nThird, the shop was a lot smaller than I imagined. I know the shop has TONS of guitars but I didn't see a single one. The shop is much like a museum in that its a single file line that goes around the store so you can browse everything. I saw absolutely no one buying anything...but then again who buys $1000 guns?\nThere was also a ton of jewelry *yawn*\n\nIf a TV crew interviewed me in the parking lot after I would have said this:\n\""I didn't get what I wanted...but that's okay. I was kind of expecting more...but I know I'll get what I want somewhere else.\"""
2,"As always, you can expect the huge menu at the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nAnd, as always, the food is consistently good. Not great, but good."
4,I've been here a few times and the food is always amazing! The spicy bulgogi is the best I have had anywhere and the bibimbap is fantastic. Service is great and I like the unique beers on tap.
4,"First time going was last night for the fish fry. I don't do reviews but they deserved one. Food all around was delicious and we bragged about it to friends later on. Service was the best we've had in a long time and the drinks were strong. It's not the cheapest fish fry around, but very well might be the best. Highly recommend and will be repeat customers."
2,Love this place. Good food and great smoothies. Only problem is they frequently appear under-staffed for the lunch rush. Food takes 20 minutes to come out and you need to remind them about the smoothies (another 20 minutes). Makes you feel bad for the stressed out employees. Could just be unlucky timing on our part but I hope they start staffing appropriately.
3,"Disclaimer:  This review is based on notion's soft opening.\n\nThank the blogosphere that I caught wind that notion was having a donation only soft launch.  I decided to surprise the fiancee and whisk her over to East Liberty one day after work for what I hoped would be a unique experience...  notion definitely didn't disappoint.\n\nEliminating any inconsistencies from the rating (can't really ding a new restaurant on that), our server did a great job explaining the four course meal with wine pairings plus the bonus two complements of the chef.  Every plate was well artistic, well presented, and complex yet refined relative to the ingredients, which are the true star of the show here.  Notion ever so slightly transforms their ingredients to meld into something that overall satisfies the palate.\n\nAlas, that is also what prevents me from giving notion a 5-star review.  Although ALL of the dishes were pleasant to eat and I would order again, NONE of them managed to blow my socks off nor leave me craving for more.  At the end of the day, we donated an amount close to what the meal would of cost anyways (we thought it was worth it), but I wouldn't find myself ever proactively seeking notion out again."
3,"A true Las Vegas experience! And the Palazzo made it happen. The location of the Palazzo was great - in the middle of the strip yet still far away from all the foot traffic of the tourists. We loved the location close to the Wynn and Encore for buffet and nightlife, respectively. \n\nWe had 6 girls and were able to easily fit in a Bella Suite. The Bella Suite had 2 queen incredibly comfy beds and a nice sleeper sofa that can fit 6-7 people. We told the hotel 2 people and were able to fit 6 girls in the suite comfortably. The bathroom had a double sink, bathtub, shower, and vanity with a private toilet! This was such a perfect arrangement for us 6 girls to use the bathroom all together. \n\nService was great and the gym was relatively big. I would definitely go back again. The only thing I didn't like was the small casino. I would just go to the Venetian next door which has a bigger casino."
0,"Charged $84.99 for hand wax, buff and polish, but did a lousy job.  Unpolished wax was left on my car.  Since the wax is white, it stands out against the dark paint of my vehicle.  The front of my car still had caked-on road dirt which would have been easily removed if they had really buffed and polished.  Also left sticky material on the outside of my windshield which I had to clean up after getting home.  Very sloppy.  Would not recommend this car wash."
3,"I will make this short, but sweet. I love this place. If I am not here, I am in lake Tahoe. But this is VEGAS and it is hard to compare them both. This trip was comped, and I was visiting for a wedding. I was astonished when I walked into the Augustus Tower Senator Suite. It makes me wish I could live there. The casino was loose, the drinks were flowing, and the Vegas feeling of luck was in the air. No big wins on the gambling, but a lot of good memories and delicious meals. See you soon, All Hail Caesar!"
4,"Visited here with a friend after waking up a little dazed and confused in the southside. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend got the Croque Monsieur. While I didn't taste his dish he said he thoroughly enjoyed it, and it looked pretty appetizing to boot. As for my food it was pretty awesome. A rather large fluffy waffle with several pieces of boneless fried chicken tenders with a really good breading. There were also scallions and pecans strewn about the dish, which I really enjoyed. I also tried the sweet potato fries with marshmallow jerk dipping sauce. Everything was very tasty and there is no doubt waffles inc is a must visit if you are in the southside."
2,"Place is typical of what you will find for a mom and pop Chinese restaurant.  Went here for lunch and it's probably the cheapest lunch I've ever had at a little over $4 so a star for that.  The food came out piping hot and it was quite tasty so another 2 stars.  I felt the customer service was not all there.  The girl that helped me seemed bothered or annoyed by me.  Would I come back here?  Probably not.  As much as i loved how affordable lunch was,  you get what you paid for and you don't get a whole lot of food.  I liked this place better as its predecessor,  panda king."
3,"Been here a few more times...really can't go wrong with anything here.  It was only recently that I found a new favorite spot in town for Japanese tapas!\n\nAgain, the ramen is not my fav in town, but still very good and fresh. \n\nI come here for the fresh seafood. The grilled mackerel and squid are very good. Can't go wrong with the crab fried rice as well! \n\nAlso went with the butter clams and a few other goodies. All pretty tasty!   Prices are pretty reasonable too :)\n\nPork Kim Chi and Red Snapper Sashimi :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=_r_afKZlImDUJNXE38em9w#_r_afKZlImDUJNXE38em9w\n\nGood rendition on the kim chi...the snapper came with a bunch of other citrus and misc that kind of hid the flavor of the fish, but was still enjoyable.\n\nWaygu Carpaccio :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=jzQqOhKS9zn6fPo34hrbdw#jzQqOhKS9zn6fPo34hrbdw\n\nGood, tender and flavorful.\n\nLastly, you have to try the butter toast! It is unbelievably good. It is a toast square, hollowed out with a bunch of honey and ice cream inside. Big enough to share! But you might not want to...Quick pic :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#vaThLUY_i4FHKKDGdbOZjQ\n\nTried a few other dessert toast items around town, and Ichiza still holds the crown in my book!"
1,"Went for Sunday lunch AYCE. The quality of the fish was the worst I had ever had. I can't believe as a restaurant you are allowed to serve such un-fresh sashimi. Maybe this place is amazing on a Thursday or Friday night, but don't bother coming here on Sunday because you'll just be eating the weekend leftovers. Most of the nigiri that we ordered was mushy and drenched in all kinds of sauces. If I'm ordering nigiri, I want to eat it the traditional way and dip it in soy sauce myself. All the rolls are creative and fun, but again everything is covered in crazy sweet sauces and it feels like overkill. \n\nLastly, the waiters never brought some of what we ordered and then brought us stuff we didn't order. If you can't get it right, you should give us one of those lists so we can check it off ourselves."
0,"i have never been treated so poorly in my life. i will never go back to this office ! they are unbelievably rude and have the absolute worst bedside manner i have ever experienced from start to finish.  \neven though they had me in their system they could not find my \""chart\"" so they decided to charge me new patient prices...even though i was clearly a patient previously. i had spent lots of time on the phone with the finance lady (like a car dealer, odd) telling her exactly what i was coming in for so financially i knew what to expect.... because last time i recieved and $800 bill, yup thats right....$800!!!!! seemed a little excessive for a pap and routine labs...they sure like taking advantage of the cash pay people which is sad especially since i'm sure they do their fair share of ripping off insurance companies. anyway, i was told to come in early for appointment, i wound up waiting over an hour in the waiting room, no one would acknowledge me so i finally asked when they could see me. they soooo so rudely brought me in back to the room. i saw the super rude grumpy nurse practitioner who treated me like i was an airhead. and instead of addressing my issues i was there for she went right into wanting to do bloodwork, cholesterol screening, mammogram, and told me i probably have a pituitary tumor!!!!!! WTF!!! who does that?? she hadnt even done a routine exam at that point. and then told me i didnt know what i was talking about. such a rude rude rude woman. they more interested in doing more labs to make money than anything. so after my horrible experience with that hag i had to deal with the car dealer finance lady who decided to then charge me new patient prices which is more than existing and more than what was agreed upon on the phone. they new and admitted they told me one thing and then made me pay another . they really are rotten people and i hate when people get into any kind of health care knowing people are ailing but they dont have the temperment to deal with it long term so they walk around like a bunch of grumpy sourpusses in the office and make patients coming in with issues feel like we're a burden! isn't that what they signed up for??? try to be a little kinder rude ladies, its probably because they're all hitting menopause in there right now"
1,"Fresh Donuts always says good morning would you like to be my friend. I work close to the shop and I love to surprise my co-workers and customers with a warm donut.  The couple that took ownership are very nice and seem to be producing a small following.  The owners are puting in the hard work to build a business and seem to be on the right track.  As the business grows I look forward to giving Rainbow Donuts more stars.  \nLook for a bright purple building, its kind of hard to see if your driving East on McDowell."
2,"LVH was good to us. It's off the strip a little, which I appreciated because it's nice to be away from the hustle & bustle. My husband and I stayed here for a last minute birthday getaway for a weekend and I booked this hotel like less than 24 hours before our arrival. I was satisfied with the pricing and it totaled around $225 for two nights including the $40 resort fee (which is a dumb fee, but it's whatever). \n\nCheck-in was smooth & totaled about 7 minutes. We got there after dark so the line was pretty empty. I was fooled & got excited because the service agent motioned my husband and I to come to this secret-looking back room for check-in. I thought we were gonna get an upgrade or something! Not so much, haha.\n\nThe room was pretty simple. We had two queen beds, a flat screen TV, and it was pretty roomy. There was a table and two office style chairs. The room was very well-cleaned and well-lit and we were satisfied. The bathroom, on the other hand, was a little on the small side and it's pretty cramped where the mirror and countertop are. The mirror and countertop actually sit right outside of the bathroom and in front of the closet, if that makes sense. We got a non-smoking room but the hotel as a whole still smelled like smoke. But it's Vegas so we weren't too surprised by that.\n\nI can't review the casino, Superbook, or food because we weren't in the hotel much for any of those. We did eat at Vince Neil's Tatuado cantina several times though for the late-night Mexican food and $1 shooters, which were delicious and definitely a plus!\n\nOur main gripes were for the confusing parking and the elevators. Both are really out of the way and are difficult to get to. The second day was smoother but still difficult to navigate through. \n\nI'd stay at LVH again. It was worth what we paid for and was nice for us overall!"
4,"Very nice place. The decor is nice and so is the atmosphere. The service was fast and for the most part friendly. The servings aren't at all large, but we left feeling very satisfied. The price is a little bit high, but not at all unbearable. Would definitely return!"
2,"This is one of my least favorite malls. Only a handful of stores I enjoy and it's always crawling with teenagers. It's in a great location, but you can get to three other great malls in 10-15 minutes."
0,"This place is disgusting! I am surprised at all of these reviews...and the crazy long line and good reviews were \""false advertising\"" for me.  We waited a while after struggling for parking on Friday night, and I had high expectations.  I got enchiladas with chile beef and tomatillo sauce with rice and black beans.  \n\n...when the kid came around to ask how our meal was, the poor guy was not expecting to listen to a real answer I am sure....but he learned that I had both a hair in my food AND a clump of salt dumped into my enchiladas.  His offer: queso for my pain (no refund or free meal coupon).  I turned him down...after all, I lost my appetite and certainly won't be back.\n\nHere is the deal - Just like Law and Order, THE ORIGINAL is the BEST...Chipotle cannot be topped..."
3,"This place is pretty unbeatable for lunch. Their lunch specials range from $3.49 up to $5.99. Today, I picked up a serving of their Spaghetti and Sausage Link special for $3.99. You get a good amount of spaghetti with a whole sausage link--some of it is thinly sliced with the remainder still being in whole sausage form. It also came with a couple of garlic knots on the side.\n\nThe sauce wasn't mind-blowing, but it was tasty enough. The sausage was well-cooked and had good flavor. They put a ton of sauce in my serving. I almost wish it had less sauce (or more pasta on the side to eat with it). The garlic knots served as a nice vessel for the extra sauce that was left over.\n\nOverall, while not the absolute best spaghetti meal I've ever had, the $4 price point is the kicker. The taste to price ratio works in their favor.\n\nMinor Update: I went back the next day and got the same lunch special. Strangely enough, it tasted even better, though the sauce was definitely on the greasy side. In any case, this solidifies their 4-star rating for me."
4,"I love love love XS!\nAnyone who is going to Vegas for their first time needs to go to this club. I have only been to Vegas twice and though I have not been to a wide variety of clubs, I know what I like and agree with what everyone else has to say! Sad to say that they close off the pool area once fall hits and definitely hinders the experience. But since I came around spring break the cabanas were cracking and the pool was so pretty. I love how XS welcomes you to put your feet in and lounge around the pool. This was greatly appreciated after going to surrender last night, where they constantly yelled at you for even touching the water. \n\nXS blows every club out of the water and those who know anything about Vegas will come here. When the cabanas are not open, XS could definitely open up so more bars because it was super packed and hard to get drinks last time."
2,"The ambiance is nice and hip, but the waiters will try to sell you more things as side dishes to drive the bill up a bit. No harm really, but they can be a bit pushy. Foods okay. Pricing ain't too bad either, considering you're in an airport"
1,"I stayed at Harrah's for one night during a recent trip to Vegas due to other accomodations within my budget on the strip being sold out for that night.  I was glad I had only signed up for one night here as this place was just a step above what a Super 8 with a casino would be like.   My room in the Carnival tower was clean, however from the drab brown decor and antiquated television, it looked like the place had not been renovated since the 90s.  The bed was not terrible, but not as comfortable as in other strip hotels I have stayed in.  It was February and lows at night in Vegas were high 40s to low 50s; however, when I entered the room the air conditioning was blasting.  I turned it off and turned the thermostat to the heat option, but the fan just blew cold air all night.  There was only one blanket provided on the bed which was thin and inadequate to keep one warm in the cool dessert with no heat.   Since even budget motels such as Motel 6 and Super 8 have wifi these days, I expected a hotel I was paying $130 for also would; however, I was suprised to find that internet access at Harrah's is only available via an ethernet cord which i  found tucked away in a random dresser drawer while searching for an extra blanket.  Even when found, the ethernet cord did me no good as I had assumed this hotel would offer modern amenities and had only brought my Ipad with me.  \n\nI had mixed feelings about the other features of the hotel.  Like the room, the casino area appeared to not have been renovated in quite awhile and smelled of smoke in some areas.  The restaurant choices on site were mediocre; you can probably find something decent if you are willing to settle but if you are looking for a special meal Harrah's is not the place.   I did enjoy the Ice Pan ice cream near the monorail stop, the Piano bar, and the Carnival area outside right outside of the casino.   Luckily, Harrah's central location on the strip can't be beat and is within walking distance of most everything else on the strip that Harrah's doesn't offer."
0,"Well..... All airplanes feel the same, once your up in the air it's all on faith! But one thing airline need to and should change is their bag policy! I mean it really is insane that after going over 1 lbs on ur bag they can charge upto 300% not to mention the initial $25! It really is a bunch of bull!"
0,"Read the reviews and had hopes for this place, which is fairly close. All I can say is \""YUCK!\"" Ordered a cheese enchilada and it was a cold unflavorful lump of cheese in a greasy, stale thick tasteless shell. Are you kidding me? Bland rice and beans. Others in our party ordered chicken tacos and found them to be about the same as my enchilada- substitute gross lump of dry flavorless chicken. The only happy person in our party was a ten year old who had ordered the fish tacos. He liked them, because, he said, they tasted like fortune cookies!"
4,"Called Rich at Four Seasons the day before Thanksgiving 2014, late in the afternoon.  He got back to me right away and pledged to come by the house in Henderson on Friday.  None of the other landscapers I contacted even returned my calls!  The job was to landscape the home of a deceased relative so the estate could be settled and the house could be sold.  The yard was a complete wreck and had not been touched in at least a year, probably longer.  There was overgrowth and dead vegetation everywhere.  \n\nRich came by at the promised time and took a look around.  He gave me what I considered a very reasonable quote for the job.  Rich worked quickly and efficiently, doing the job in the time promised and did not ask for extra $$$ to cover \""unexpected\"" costs as some landscapers do.  He communicated well, and made sure I was informed of everything that he was going to do.  He was completely professional and paid attention to every detail that I asked about.  By the time he was done, the yard looked great.  Bottom line, Rich came through for this out-of-towner in a big way.  I would absolutely recommend Four Seasons to anyone for their landscaping needs!"
0,"We went to Sugar Factory for a  mother/daughter breakfast... It was the worst breakfast ever in my life! The staff is very rude with clients, very unprofessional. We had a table next to a noisy place (workers were working above us with dangerous apparels). I asked three times to change my table with a new one. The place was empty. The waitress was very impolite and not very helpful, very stupid! She has to change her job. I had to stand up and ask to the manager to solve the issue. Same reaction, stupid people who look at me as they didn't meet a client ever. They didn't try for a minute to understand me. I was very frustrated and at least very angry! I didn't want to continue but I was forced to stay in the restaurant! We waited 20 minutes for the new table and the breakfast was cold. Conclusion: RUDE PEOPLE, TOO high prices for no special food, DON'T GO THERE and KEEP YOUR MONEY for something else!"
1,"This place is another Chipotle styled fast food Mexican restaurant brought to you by the owners of Delux and Zen32. Decor and styling are very similar to the other restaurants (eclectic) and is very vibrant. There is a very cool vibe when you walk in and some very original decorations. \n\nFood. I was very disappointed, since I like Delux quite a bit, I had very high expectations for Revo. The portions were a bit on the small side and the flavors were very lacking. I expected a full flavored carne asada and got a very bland meat burrito with a guacamole that might as well have been just avocado puree. The rice was pretty decent and had a creamy texture similar to a risotto, but needed salt and spices. The only redeeming factors were the amazing lemonade and the salsa. I'm not sure a place this bland will survive with so many other better options around that area, but I know I won't be going back without some major changes."
4,Nicole is awesome!!!  I love how they serve you wine as soon as you walk in!
3,"We went here twice during the 4 days we were in Montreal.  (Yes, it's that good.)  We got the sandwiches to go (the to-go line never had a wait) and sat on the curb to eat them.  This is my favorite kind of food:  simple but delicious.  Don't forget to get a pickle with your sandwich."

4,Best fast food Chinese place in town. Eat here and you'll never go back to Panda Express.
0,"Ace Taxi is by far the worst taxi company I have come across. Last week I had to catch a bus that was leaving at 2:30pm from the Excalibur. I called the day before to reserve a pick-up at my house at 1:45pm with strict instructions to not be late. About 4 hours before the expected pick-up I called, again, to confirm that someone was coming and they assured me that they were. At 1:50pm I was standing outside my house, bags in hand, waiting... I then called to see why the taxi was late and the women on the phone told me that no one was on their way. It was the worst feeling because I had already paid for my bus ticket and was left with no option. On top of which, I was traveling to see my fiance who I missed dearly, and felt I was not going to be able to see him. In a panic I ran to my neighbors house, who I have only spoken to once, and asked if they would give me a ride, which they nicely did. \n\nDO NOT USE THIS TAXI COMPANY!"
0,"The food is whack. Calamari was nothing special. Hong Kong wonton noodle soup was not good. The soup came in a cup and you have to pour it in and it was not hot enough. Service was horrific, slow and rude. Would not recommend this place."
3,"One of the best places to eat in Las Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect restaurant whether its only you and your significant other, or a group of 8! I came here with a group of friends for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. We had made reservations ahead of time through their website and noted that we were celebrating his birthday and requested a table near the windows so that we would have a view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately and got a wonderful table inside by the window and the view was amazing! On a side note, if the weather permits it, it is definitely worth it to wait for a table on the outside patio. The restaurant does NOT reserve these outdoor tables, so it is on a first-come-first-serve basis. But you can still request a table inside with a view.\n\nFresh french bread was brought with some creamed butter and a little bit of something that resembled a reddish pink coleslaw, but it was so tasty with the bread! I ordered a caraffe of the Frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of Perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared a shrimp cocktail. Our friends ordered a Caesar salad and a French onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!\n\nI ordered the steak classique rare. My boyfriend ordered the sea scallops, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. One thing I noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. It looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! Everything looked fantastic! I have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because I had ordered it rarer than usual. The finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. At the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! Next time I am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n\nMon Ami Gabi's prices were another big reason I chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. The prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. I will definitely be returning to Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate my birthday!\n\nAlthough the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic French bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very American boyfriend and his friend. They ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! So I recommend Mon Ami Gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. But if you're not into French restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the Bellagio Buffet across the street. : )"
0,"I got a cut, highlight and \""conditioning treatment\"" and my stylist was Jonathan. I told him my hair was very fine and you could easily see abrupt lines etc if my layers aren't blended. I asked him for some framing around my face, some long layers and advised I don't want to lose a lot of length. My hair ended up choppy and uneven. There is not a nice v shape in the back like I asked for and it's super short around my face. The highlights look good but the cut is horrible. He was rough the entire time and was combing my hair out with a paddle brush afterward when it was very tangled and was pulling hair out. I cried when I got home and realized just how bad it was. Then a friend of mine and I were talking and she went there and got him as well and he ruined her hair too. She went back so he could fix it but ended up walking out and going elsewhere to have it fixed. I'll be doing the same thing tomorrow - going elsewhere to have it fixed. Also, track pants and a tshirt are not acceptable attire for a salon/spa. And the cheesy vending machine in the waiting area? I should have walked out immediately. Don't go here.\n\nJust an update. I went to Hotbox Salon today to have my hair fixed and David, the owner fixed my hair so beautifully. Highly recommend going to Hotbox and skipping Aspen all together!!\n\nI'll try and upload a new pic of my fixed hair\nCut."
3,"We went for a late-afternoon lunch and were impressed by the charm and service! It's annoying to be snubbed by servers just because we don't look Asian (we're both mixed), and we were happy to be welcomed here. We accidentally ordered too many fried dishes (did not know the chicken was fried...); our server was kind and offered to suggest meals for us in the future. \n\n1. Red Bean Delight: yummy sweet drink with red beans and jelly. Somewhat like che ba mau, but less colorful.\n2. Shanghai Dumplings: delicious, hot dumplings that are a little soupy inside.\n3. Sweet Potato Fries w/ Black Sesame: cute take on sliced sweet potatoes.\n4. Salt & Pepper Calamari: not bad, not exceptional. just fine.\n5. Hammered Chicken w/ Rice: the chicken was better than our expectations, but the rice was different (made with tomatoes). It came with steamed vegetables, which were both things we didn't care for.\n\nOverall, the good score comes from the atmosphere + service + Red Bean + Dumplings. Their menu is unique, e.g. spaghetti, and because of the affordable prices, you can try many dishes."
2,"I went to St. Francis on a weekday and it was very busy... I thought the food must be great... the best thing on the menu was the flat bread... Not too impressed wit the menu or with the rest of the food than we ordered. Good value in the wine list, attentive service. Valet parking??? Nice I never had anybody valet my car only two feet away??? but I guess we had no choice... I liked the decor... it reminded me like Chicago and Philadelphia restaurants  with the brick walls and the hardwood floor (well done on that)...  Overall just an Ok..."
0,"Convenience was the only factor when choosing to come here for past car washes and, most recently, an oil change. There's something overwhelming about the amount of people that swarm your car the minute you pull up and repeatedly try to sell you additional services without your solicitation. \n\nOne of the employees asked for my phone number and I asked why he needed it. \""In case we have to up-sell you or return your car,\"" was his response. Reluctantly I gave it and sure enough I received a call while I was grocery shopping and waiting. The employee asked me if I wanted additional services after I already said no. I insisted \""no\"" and he still persisted. Very frustrating.\n\nAfter the carwash, there was oil all over the inside of my car and I had to ask the employee to wipe the writing off my windshield which obstructed my view. \n\nI will drive the distance for a better place in the future. Convenience is no longer worth the compromised service."
1,"I'm Korean so I know what korean food tastes bad or good. The kimchi was good but the soup was not so great and I've tasted sooo much better! The service was a bit bad also, only one lady working while the owner is just sitting around drinking beer and watching T.V. Our lady server spilled the rice bowl on the floor causing a bit of commotion. In one of our orders, they forgot the cow meat in the soup and just gave us the plain soup. We informed her and 10 minutes later she brings out the cow meat in a different bowl. In addition, slow service, it took them 30 minutes to bring us out our food. I've tasted better, I probably won't be coming back here again."
3,"There aren't many vegan options on the menu but the waitress we had was super friendly and accommodating! She knew the menu inside/out and helped me choose a few tapas that would work with my dietary needs. \n\nEverything I had was good, not amazing, but I'm just happy they worked with me on the menu. My carnivorous friends thought their items were phenomenal! \n\nWe did chose to get our items a la carte because we weren't super hungry and for about 12 items, 2 beers and one of those girly drinks, our total was just under $60."
0,"Used to be imperial. Currently under reno so place is a mess,dirty and smelly. Horrible parking."
3,"After a long work day, my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance... and she came up with yet another Champaign winner!\n\nInterior is stylish, minimal and dark.  Our booth was large and comfy.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough.  Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby, the dirty Martini.  My first one with organic corn vodka, which made for a smooth sipping drink.  Loved it.  J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.\n\nWe tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs).  The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper.  The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!\n\nNext up, a la carte soup.  I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors.  J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here.  Both soups were wonderfully creamy.  Bowls were decent-sized for $5.\n\nMy entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces).  Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish.  A bit of a disappointment.  J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge.  Perfectly pink pork.\n\nWe parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full.  I would return and try everything new (other than my Martini)."
1,"I am an F&B industry person and it literally hurts my heart to give a 2 star; however, I am rating based on my experience and HOPE that management takes that into account to improve quality and service. And honestly, I would rate 1 star on food but the service made up for the bad experience. \n\nCelebrating mother's day weekend, I was looking for a casual place to have lunch and enjoy some shopping.  I have my favorite dining spots but wanted to try something different.  West Addison at DC Ranch seemed like a good decision but was unfortunately wrong.  \n\nMy BF and I sat at the bar since it was literally empty.  That's cool, I like personalized service! No complaints on that.  I ordered the Tuna Salad and my BF ordered the Napa Salad.  We also ordered the guacamole.  1st of all, the guac was watery and brown.  It is on the menu as \""fresh\"" but I find it hard to believe.  It had ice chips in it and I am pretty sure it came out of a Costco tub or the like.    So for my salad, my \""seared\"" ahi tuna also came out brown and literally frozen.  YUCK! The bartender tells me that they premake and fridge the tuna daily.  Sorry, when it comes to raw I prefer made to order and special guidelines apply.  It was horrible and I sent it back.\nThe Napa salad that my BF ordered was not very significant at all.   The pulled chicken was good and I liked the flavor of the dill ranch but other than that is was just a bed of lettuce.\n\nBiggest waste of $35 dollars I have spent in a long time.  Good for a drinking spot but the kitchen needs a lot of work!"
2,"Well, for the cheapest rooms on the strip, this is your place. Don't expect anything out of the room though. My friend and I checked in and were put in a broken down little room with a BEAUTIFUL window view of the hotel ceiling and ventilation system... which begs the question... WHY WOULD THEY EVEN MAKE A ROOM THERE? Really, that's all that you could see from our window besides the sky. The bathroom was really run down, too. But whatever, we laughed, dropped off our crapola and went out for what was to become the greatest drunken escapade and adventure in history. Other than sleeping in our room (and throwing up in the hallway) we spent no time at the Tropicana itself.\n\n3 stars because you just can't beat $49/night on the strip.. on a weekend (booked on Travelzoo, I think). I've heard that they're rennovating now, it's about time. Prior to the rennovation, I would only recommend staying here with your friend if you're looking to spend next to nothing on a room. With their rennovations and obvious restructuring of their customer service, I'd be more than happy to return if I'm on a budget. I just hope the prices stay low."
4,"I LOVE, LOVE Americas Taco Shop! The best carne asada and al pastor I have ever had and I am completely addicted to the ceviche. We eat ATS once a week if we can get over there. Go visit! It is amazing!!"
3,"After volunteering at the Wine Walk at Town Square for 4 hours, it was already close to 10:30pm and BFF Mel C. and I still needed to eat some food, even though it was way past my bedtime.  We picked Herbs & Rye on the fly and it was a nice choice, especially since they stay open late.\n\nI had:\ntomato bisque with grilled cheese \nside of truffle mac n cheese\nsome of the calamari that Mel ordered\n\nFirst of all, it's dark in there.  I had a hard time reading my menu.  They play really good music.  The service is great and our food came out fast.  Maybe because I couldn't see that well in the dark or because I was sleepy, I didn't realize my soup came with a grilled cheese sandwich.  I probably wouldn't have ordered the mac n cheese side, but then again, I love mac n cheese and theirs was flavorful. I enjoyed everything I had except the calamari.  There was too much going on there with some assorted toppings and I'm not even sure what they were:  green peppers, green onions, some kind of mayo dressing?  I had to dig towards the bottom of the bowl to get to some of the calamari that was untouched by all that stuff.  \nOverall, it was a great meal and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place.  We'll have to go back to try one of the alcoholic concoctions on the menu that looked great and when I'm more awake."
4,"LGO is definitely my go-to place for breakfast, lunch, and brunch. Oh who am I kidding...dinner and dessert as well! My favorite thing to do is to come in on a Sunday morning after the hectic activities of the weekend, and enjoy a delicious breakfast in their trendy atmosphere. Of course, everyone talks about their commuter sandwich, but my absolute favorite is the tuna salad on 9-grain. I always come into LGO intending to try something new, but I can never stray away from that sandwich. The thin apple slices paired with the perfect consistency of tuna salad, placed between two pieces of crispy toast, is like heaven in my mouth. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is also a great boost on the weekend mornings!\n\nI love LGO so much that now they've opened a location in the Sky Harbor Airport, I ALWAYS make a point to go to that terminal (even if my flight does not depart or arrive there), JUST so I can get my fill of LGO. Recently I tried their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and is smitten. It is an incredibly rich cookie, but I love the chunky texture of it and how it looks so fresh and homemade. Plus the shaved sea salt perfectly balances out the sweetness of the dark chocolate! It is a humongous cookie though...and it is very filling.\n\nLGO also has a display of the cutest and quirkiest items on sale in the front. It's a great way to kill time while waiting for your order, as the lines as always very long on the weekends. It's a fun place to grab some unique gifts for your friends!"
3,"Nice smoothies but this review is more a plug for their spring rolls-- not sure if these are a regular item (there was a sign taped to the straw dispenser advertising them), but a single spring roll here was nearly as big as a burrito-- so a spring roll and a smoothie will pretty much set you up for lunch!"
0,It's not okay... Waited 30 minutes just for a glass of wine. The management had the poor servers completely overworked. Additionally the food was not very good... It was fish and fries night and nobody liked it in my group. This is a management problem.
4,"Bring cash.They don't take cards. Molcajetes is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.\n\nLindo Michoacan, Faustos, and Agave can't compare because they don't have the Molcajete. From what I understand, Molcajete means volcano in Spanish. This restaurant's signature dish, \""the Molcajete,\"" is served in a black, heavy volcanic rock that looks like the mortar, as in a mortar and pestle (that you pound herbs with). The rock keeps the meat moist and it's decorated with tasty fillings for a fajita. My favorite amongst the fillings is the roasted cactus which looks like a green pepper. They also serve this with big chunks of Mexican cheese--the white, crumbly stuff.\n\nI always order the chicken molcajete without the red sauce because I'm prone to heartburn. One order provides two meals, easy. \n\nMolcajetes is kid friendly. There's a jukebox loaded with Spanish music that bumps pretty loudly at night. Do not buy the DVDs from the kids that offer them out of their book bags."
1,"Open 24hrs. Came in @ 9pm on a friday night and there were 4 tables occupied. Parents&I ordered the B menu? I wasn't hungry so they just chose. Anyways it came with octopus and gogi, kongnamul(bean sprouts?), kimchi and they fry everything with rice at the end for you. I think the difference between A and B was that A came with chadol. I thought the size was a bit small for 2 people. I mean the Buena Park location gives you enough so you have leftovers but they were pretty scarce though I understand that times are tough. Anyways the workers are not very bright, so don't expect to be heartily welcomed and tended to. Food was OK. not great. Oh and some comfortable chairs would be nice."
0,"Thievery at its worst! My co-worker Carly was led to believe by Garrett Bias, a manager at this location, that she needed to get a voucher from her employer to get a discount (a complete lie because I never needed a voucher) and then proceeded to give her the run around about refunding her money. \n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that this Garrett guy called one of my friends a bitch, called his corporate office to tell them a whole different story of what happened to cover his rude ass (he called a very rude and unprofessional lady called Kaitlyn ID#1912043) and is still not willing to accept that he conned her out of her money and lied to her face about her contact. \n\nBe warned!"
3,The service was friendly and prompt.  We didn't have to wait for our refills or our order to be taken. The food arrived and was well prepared and tasted delicious.
2,"I read about this restaurant on Yelp and was very excited to find a good ramen place. \n\nAs all the other Yelpers mentioned, it is VERY warm in the restaurant so be prepared! The whole restaurant only fits about 26 people but we were lucky we were the only customers.\n\nI went with my boyfriend and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen w/ egg and he had the miso w/ corn, egg & extra chashu. Even in the heat I definitely enjoyed the ramen. The broth was very savory and delicious. The chashu was very soft and also very flavorful. I would definitely order the extra chashu next time we go there. I've never had corn in my ramen before (except for the american cuponoodles) but it added a nice crunch to the dish and sweetness.\n\nThe service was good but just be careful with your bill there. This was the first time we went there and they rang up 3 cokes instead of 2. After the transaction was completed she had corrected it by giving us cash back for the misrung item. After leaving the restaurant and being a day later, we came to realized the server charged his debit card TWICE for the meal as well. So not only did they rang up extra items on our tab but they charged the transaction TWICE.\n\nKeep in mind that we were the only people in the restaurant as well so it wasn't like it was very busy. \n\nOverall I was happy with the meal, just will keep in mind to pay cash and triple check the tab from now on."
2,"No frills off the strip property with incredible room rates, a liquor store, multiple places to eat and good size clean rooms. \n\nPlenty of close by self park and good valet service."
2,"Pretty decent place. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. My friends and I stopped by on a cold rainy night for a few burgers. \n\nI felt like being semi-healthy so I ordered the rosemary goat cheese and apple burger but with a veggie patty. I regret ordering the veggie patty because it was not very good. It wasn't terrible, but I've had better. (Ex: kaya, stack'd, burgatory). \n\nThe cheese and apples were delicious, however. I definitely would order again, but with a regular burger!\n\nFor my side, I got the ginger broccoli. It is served cold, which I wasn't expecting. It was really good, though!\n\nAll in all, good place that I'd be willing to try again."
2,"For me, the best thing about this gym is it's location.  Tons of cardio equipment makes it so that I never have to wait.  Things got confusing with the \""closure\"" and the emails from Fitness Works saying that they were happy to take over our contracts with the former Fitness Factory.  Thanks to Dani C's review, I found that Fitness Factory is still open.  So, I've been going back there.  It's been quiet, a little dark, and has a lot of machines in \""maintenance in progress\"" status.  But things are coming back together and they are even starting to put TVs back up.  I really only come here for cardio, so I can't complain.  I wouldn't join as a new member (and I don't even know if they are accepting new members right now anyway) but I'll continue to come here as long as they let us during this whole \""transition\"" period."
4,"Burger joints are pretty trendy right now, and out of all the trendy burger joints I've tried, Smashburger has to be my favorite. The burgers are good, not too thick, not too greasy, and really flavorful. I especially like the fried onions they put on them. But it isn't the burgers that actually make me love this place- it's the fries! The smash fries are covered in rosemary, garlic and olive oil and they are delicious. No kidding- you can't come here without trying those fries."
3,"When your tennis instructor has you and 8 others hitting balls for 2-and-a-half-hours in the 105 degree heat at Freedom Park, the last thing I wanted was a greasy burger or stir fry, or pizza.  My body was craving hydration and something fresh and cold. \n\nInstead of our usual apres-tennis East Boulevard lunch haunts, my husband and I checked out Something Classic Cafe.  (Home of the gourmet TV dinner which I will get to in a moment.) \n\nI got the salad trio with the chicken salad, fruit salad and organic baby greens. (Yes, you will pay slightly more for these organic greens, but I think it's worth it.)  It was just what I needed, something not laden with too many ingredients, and not too heavy. The lettuce leaves were all perky and crisp (a pet peeve of mine is slimy leaves.  That's an instant 1-star demotion) and the chicken salad, not over dressed. \n\nEv got the turkey, brie and granny smith apple sandwich which came with a small salad.  He had wanted potato salad, but for some reason I don't think it was available that day. The sandwich was well composed with just the right proportion of brie, turkey and apple. \n\nThe reason why I'm not giving SCC 5 stars, is the dessert.  The strawberry cake slice was enormous.  As soon as I took a bite though, I realized it was either several days old, or somebody over beat the cake batter.  It was HARD and crumbled at the touch.  The frosting too was cracking.  Too bad we had gotten it to go, or I would have walked right back and asked for a refund. \n\nI like SCC, despite this cake disaster.  Besides the super fresh cafe offerings, their \""TV Dinners\"" are a nice alternative to cooking some weeknights.  (think: classic chicken pot pies and chicken with pear couscous.)\n\nPS:  Love how the utensils are made of recycled corn. The cafe even sells little bundles of them.  (They're not exactly cheap compared to other plasticware, but the eco-friendly aspect gives this place a nice touch.)"
1,"The hamburger was cold and too thick for an \""original\"" hamburger. The fries where not cooked correctly. THE PLACE IS WAY TO LOUD. When the cashier has to keep saying \""what\"" a few times it is to loud."
1,"I have traveled to Japan many times and recently brought my wife on my last trip. She's not a big sushi fan, so instead we discovered 'Yakitori' and what a delight. There's nothing better then to sit at a bar and watch your meat sticks getting cooked while drinking super cold beer. \n\nWith such a great experience my wife and I found this restaurant while in Vegas and we were excited to get more of the 'Yakitori' experience. \n\nI would say that Raku has potential but no where near a true yakitori joint. When we got there the two tables to our side were empty. We started with a few plates and ordered the calamari special. Twenty minutes later both tables to our side were seated and ten minutes after that both were getting served food that we had ordered and not yet received. After getting something here and there we still hadn't received most of our food including the calamari.. and this is going on an hour.. I asked the waitress and her exact quote was \""Calamari takes a really long time to cook?  After asking for the bill, the calamari came and the rest of the 6 plates we had ordered.... For some reason our table was totally ignored. This place is ok if you haven't had the real deal, but I would never go back..."
1,"Food was a 4 star, service was a 1. Ordered a drink, waited, and waited, and waited...Then, heres the food. Told the waiter, he said, my bad, let me go get it. Then came back and asked what I had. He acted like he wrote it down the first time. Obivouly didn't! When I say waited, I mean like 20 minutes. Had the burger, it was good. Overall the group of 9 was not overly impressed. Some like the food, some did not, but we all agreed that the service was HORRIBLE. With some many great places, I will try something new before I head back!"
3,"I have been a patron of Bado's several times now, and this is a great spot to have few beers, watch a game, and meet up with friends.  Their beer selection is commendable and is frequently updated.  I have sat a the bar and had a table.  I've never had a problem with service.  Staff is knowledgeable and makes great suggestions.  \nNow for the food...their pizza is so yummy!  I love everything about it. The cheese, sauce, toppings...all great.  Their wings are also good.  \nIt can get quite packed during a game or on a weekend evening, so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b/c it's worth it."
2,"Food is good, Meat Jun, spicy pork ,and Kalbi.. just like Hawaii kine Yummy's and Tasty BBQ, btw the owners are from Hawaii also.. wit side of mac salad, kim chee, long rice, and much more. Prices are reasonable."
0,"Horrible service- host and waitress barely spoke English. The hibachi chef had to clean dishes from the table as he was cooking because the waitress was nowhere to be found. We had to wait 15 minutes after asking twice for drink refills. Food was good, but overall it was a very bad dining experience. Worst hibachi joint in the Vegas area."
3,"This is one of the most beautiful patisseries I've ever been to (including those in France): simply gorgeous cakes and cookies and tarts and meringues, stunning pastries and petit fours, all displayed beautifully. My family and I have had some of the best croissants here (after being extremely disappointed with those at a cafe on Greene). I was relieved that my kids were able to experience \""real\"" Montreal croissants: buttery and flaky and light, as they are meant to be.\n\nThe coffees are wonderful as well. \n\nI'd easily have given this patisserie 5 stars, but when I went there for my morning cafe au lait and croissant the other day, I was stunned to hear that their only coffee maker was broken. We had to leave and go elsewhere (as did other folks in line). I not sure how long the machine was broken, or how often this occurs, but I was surprised that an awesome cafe like this did not have some sort of back-up plan....."
2,"Whenever I try out a new Mexican restaurant, I always get a Chile Relleno because this reflects most accurately to me the quality of the kitchen.  Too many places just put some fake cheese on a bell pepper and hope you don't notice. \n\nLet me say it was a solid chile relleno. Great melty queso oaxaca, the poblanos had just a touch of heat, and the eggs were stiff enough to hold up even though I got it to go! Good stuff and freshly made.\n\nThe easy part is what they messed up though!\nI got an al pastor burrito and was very disappointed.  Al pastor should be nice and crispy, like it just came off the trompo. This meat though, was likely sitting in a serving bin under a heat lamp for hours.  Too bad after such a promising start."
0,"Wowwwwwser RUDE front desk staff in person and on the phone doesn't matter what time of day or night. I know it's historic but besides what it use to be, is far gone now. Never will be back ! Pay a little extra somewhere else not worth the headache.  I'm easy going and respect people why is it so hard for your staff to do the same Riviera/ AM manager Angela/ PM manager Mandy ( hopefully you talked to that Jennifer on the PM shift) ? ? ? Your only as good as your team , step it up !!"
3,"I can say that this sushi place is one of the best place i've been to here in vegas! Great service , Great food! Def coming back."
2,"Went to Prive for my friends birthday \""days\"" lol, and this was one of the places we went to. Being a group of girls we were able to get in right away without cover. The staff was really friendly as they were letting us in. I have been here before on a Friday night and had an amazing time. This time it was a Monday night and while it was fun it was extremely overwhelmingly crowded. They have 2 areas, the 2nd area is only open on weekends we found out on this trip, which could've been the cause of it being so packed inside. They were playing great music but there wasn't any room to dance. So my recommendation is to go on a weekend when both rooms are open so that way you have room to move around, but it might be a little harder to get in unless you purchase a table on the weekends."
1,"I was excited to try this place because I saw it on a PBS documentary about Hot Dogs and I have been trying to go and eat at all these different establishments. I was staying in the Westward Ho and low and behold I stepped out of our room and there it was. True to the documentary the dogs are inexpensive (99 cents) and HUGE. Me and my buddy halfed them. Unfortunately, it both gave us stomach pains some time later. The hot dog is nothing really special epicurean wise. Obviously, it's the size and price that attract customers to help put quarters in the machines at Slots Of Fun. At least I can say I tried it and cross it off my list."
3,"Really good food and good variety of dishes for a group without breaking the bank. I took 9 people out and with four appetizers, four bottles of wine, a few cocktails, entrees for everyone and three shared desserts we left for right around $500 with tip.  The s'mores are probably the best dessert I've ever had. Really cool place for a group dinner."
1,"Pizza Bianco was our first meal after arriving for Spring Training.  It's pretty close to the airport, about 15 minutes away.  We arrived at 9 PM to which the hostess gave us an approximate wait time of 90 minutes.  We sat on the benches and grabbed some wine from the bar next door.  Sure enough, we weren't seated until about 10:30 PM.  Be sure to stay around the restaurant at 10 PM as they perform a roll call.  \n\nWe ordered a Wiseguy and Margurita for our entrees.  Our waitress gave the tables by us bread and olive oil but neglected us until we asked another waitress.  The bread was actually quite delicious.  As for the pizza, it was good, but not outstanding as we hoped.  We have had similar pizza in Dallas and San Francisco.  Was this the best, no it was not.   Waiting for a few hours, one expects the pizza to live up to the hype and unfortunately the pizza is overrated.  \n\nWe left saying that we tried Pizza Bianco but we won't be back here for our next Spring Training trip.  It's just not worth the wait and there are other pizza places just as good in the Phoenix area."
4,"The root salon is such a cute place, great customer service and amazing end product. Went in for a color and cut and was booked with Emily B. Love my hair, can't rave enough about her work. She brought life back to my dull dry hair."
4,"After seeing at least one of my yelp friends check in here a few times a week over the past year, it was finally time I made the trek downtown to get some gelato. Even though I don't live close, I see myself becoming a regular! It was so good! \n\nWe came in around 8:30 on a Thursday night and were the only ones in the shop, so we got a nice little presentation from the man behind the counter with a sampling of just about every flavor. Desyree also came out and introduced herself and told us about some of the crazy flavors she makes. It was tough to choose just one flavor since they were all so good, but I finally picked the black sesame. If I picked strictly off the names, I probably wouldn't have chosen this one, but after I tasted it I just wanted more! The flavor was so interesting, and just mildly sweet. I'm not a fan of super sweet desserts, so this was perfect! \n\nI know the flavors are always changing, so I guess I  need to come back again soon!"
0,"After receiving a very nasty reply from the owner regarding my last review, I now wish that I could give this dump -5 stars. As a \""professional business man\"" one would think that the owner would be open to critique that could better his business. Apparently, this is not the case at Baja Joes. Not only was the food horrid, the owner is also snide and condescending, cannot say that I am surprised. The food really is a reflection of their owner. I am absolutely taken aback by the amount of unprofessional (or lack thereof) from Baja J. The purpose of my last review was NOT to promote another business or \""ride anyone's coat tails\"". I was simply leaving my honest opinion about several Mexican dishes that I know a GREAT deal about! Growing up in a Hispanic household, I KNOW what good/real Mexican seafood tastes like, and regrettably, you will not find either at Baja Joes. Baja J, I apologize if my previous review was too honest for you, however, you sir, need to learn some professionalism and respect! Please understand that this was my honest review of YOUR food and what needs improvement. Again this was MY honest review of YOUR restaurant. If I wanted to promote another restaurant I would leave a review on THEIR page, not yours! I am in NO WAY affiliated with any restaurant, if I was, don't you think that I would be promoting the heck out of it? Do your research Baja J, I have not even reviewed the establishment I mentioned previously. If I were you, I would take a serious look at your menu, recipes, and attitude because judging by other reviewers I am not the only one who has had these complaints. Do you belittle and undermine everyone who does not like your restaurant? Would you prefer that I say I have received better meals from Taco Bell, or would that be promoting another business as well? Future diners beware, if you do not care for their food you will be publicly chastised for your honest opinion. The owner will not try to remedy the situation or make up for the fact that you wasted $65 on a terrible experience. Heck, he wont even apologize that you had a bad meal. Absolutely inexcusable."
3,"In Vegas, we have a inordinate amount of delicious Thai Cuisine at our fingertips, which is awesome because it's such an accessible food and we could have it everyday, (although I'm not a spicy kind of guy, I can't get enough of Thai food).... I could go on and on about Thai food and the other restaurants that we love, but then we wouldn't have anything for our future posts, so I'll keep it short; in terms of geographic convenience, Archi's Thai Bistro is a really great place to feed your Thai addiction!\n\nWe have a real bad addiction to Pad See Ew; the Soy coated flat noodles, which has a chewy, satisfying texture along with the crunch of Chinese Broccoli stems and my favorite protein-Pork and Egg it's unbelievably tasty!!\n\nSo I love all the Apps here, but it's impossible to order all of them in one sitting, so, we'll add updates to this post when we've come back and ordered more.  This time, we ordered the stuffed wings; boneless Chicken wings that have been stuffed with minced pork, clear noodles and vegetables that are then deep fried!  It's a miniature, pre-TurDuckEn type of App that, with the Plum Sauce, is a great starter. Protein component, check! Fried component, check!\n\nOther great Apps-Chicken or Pork Satay, with the Peanut Sauces, it's pretty addictive.  As well, the Pla Muk Tod (fishcake) is awesome to tempt your palate before the main event!  The Soups are good too, I just can't have too much cuz I sweat way to much on my head eating hot stuff-but Tom Kha Gai is my favorite\n\nThere's just nothing like Thai Curry; I'm partial to Massamum or Penang Curry (I find that the sweeter\ncurries create a balance with the heat) but I won't turn away a Red, Yellow or Green one from the table!  This time we ordered the Country Curry- a homemade Red Curry with a lot of vegetables in a lighter soup.  It's delectable!\n\nYUMMM!\n\nRating (Out of Five Stars)\n\nFood:            4\nAmbience:    3\nService:        4"
1,"Today was the first time I had a meal from this restaurant.  It  was pretty busy so I figured it would be fantastic. I ordered the BLT Grilled Cheese that comes with a mixed greens side to go.  The side: the dressing tasted of Olive Oil and nothing else - seemed too greasy.  Thank goodness for the cranberries, they added flavor.  The sandwich, while it had good flavor, the bacon was very, very undercooked verging on raw.  I have uploaded a picture so you won't think I'm crazy. The bread (as it should be for a restaurant named Bread and Butter) was wonderful!  If I ever go back, I'll be sure to ask that the bacon is cooked a bit more crispy."
2,"I stayed at both the older rooms and the newer rooms... The older rooms REALLY sucked... They smelled really bad and was not well maintained. \nThe new rooms On The other hand, the GO Towers was awesome. I loved the mini fridge that they had. I can keep cold water and drinks in there for the kids. They were much cleaner and super comfortable. \nAs for the table games.... There were a few really great dealers but a majority if them seem as I'd they don't want to be there."
2,"I stayed here June 30-July 3, during some serious heat. The nights averaged 82 degrees!!!! During the day its was well over 100.\nI stayed in the North Tower and the prices were decent, though I waited 5 minutes too long to book my room online a few weeks before and the prices went up by 25 dollars.\nI recommend staying in the North Tower, apparently it has been renovated while the South Tower supposedly needs an overhaul.\nThe rooms were clean, spacious and the housecleaning was great. There were plenty of extra towers and toiletries available.\nThe location is key, it is right in the middle of the strip.\nThe only problem is that the pool is a long walk from the rooms, and the crowd is certainly far from beautiful\nI will spring the extra 50 bucks for the Paris Pool or 100 for a pool with eye candy :-)\nBut if Eye candy is not your goal, you should stay here, the location and price is good.\n\nThe slots are not that great though and missing a few of my favorite games."
4,"Me: Serial gym hopper, recovering gym rat. \n\nSeeking: The perfect gym. \n\nVerdict....wow. Lots of equipment, some I've never seen before. Friendly staff. CrossFit. Heavy bags. Sauna AND steam room, love it. A little more expensive than the discount gym factories but absolutely worth it."
1,"I am VERY disappointed with my experience here. I had bought a couple of groupons when they were available ($10 for $20) because I was excited about a local alternative to Sprinkles (which in my opinion, does not live up to all the hype).\n\nDecided to use one of the groupons to get some cake pops for my team of co-workers for valentines day. Expecting today to be chaos, I stopped in yesterday to purchase them. Before I made my purchase, the woman behind the counter said that I should come back tomorrow as they would have some special pops for valentines day. So I did....\n\nI waited in line for 20 minutes upon their opening, only to have the woman behind the counter tell me that they did not have the pops available for regular purchase by the dozen. My only option was to buy them in boxed sets of 4 (very pretty gift items, but defeating for my purpose) for $19.99. After some protest, she said that I could buy a dozen pops, but they only had the custom ones available and they would be about $10 more for the dozen. I told her that it was my intent to use the groupon to cover the majority of the cost, so I wanted the standard pops. She finally agreed and I walked away with 6 white cake and 6 chocolate cake pops. PS, When you look at the menu, there are * flavors listed as \""House flavors\"" and I went in with the intention of getting a variety. She told me that the only house flavors were plain chocolate and plain vanilla and any other flavor would be an additional charge.\n\nMy biggest problem is that I wanted to inform a manager/owner about the situation. I feel that as a customer, I was given incorrect information that inconvenienced me and I wanted to let him/her know. I was directed to the individual at the register who disregarded my experience completely and was quite rude. \n\nPlease fix your menu so the pricing makes sense and try to give more accurate information to customers, especially if they are making more than one trip to your store based on what you tell them."
0,Are you kidding me?  I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. It is fast food BBQ. If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here. Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks!
2,"Comfy seats, good service, below average food. Don't forget to bring your parking pass to get it validated."
3,"As expected from Four Points, excellent Front Desk service, friendly and efficient staff--checking in and out was a breeze.  The rooms are clean and tidy.  They have everything I needed, but there's one thing I wish they have for their guests, disposable slippers.\n\nBreakfast, well, for convenience, it's not bad.  They offer cereals, apple and orange juice, etc.  Hot food consists of breakfast sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, made-to-order omelettes, waffles and pancakes.  Salty, salty, bland, burnt (twice), gave up on the rest, respectively.  Don't expect much in terms of their breakfast items.  It is what it is.\n\nBreakfast service, just like any of their other staff, nice and friendly.\n\n30 Day Yelp Challenge (2/30)"
1,This place closes at 6 on Tuesday.
2,"Here's the thing - Oregano's has a cute marketing campaign and full restaurants. I guess their food is pretty good, but off the top of my head I can think of 15 other restaurants with better pizza. However, it has become my go-to place for out-of-town guests. I do not understand why, but I have yet to take a non-AZ friend there who has not gone crazy for Oreganos.\n\nI like the Mesa restaurant because it is the only location that does not have huge weight times. In fact, one night I took a friend there and it was almost empty! \n\nWhatever location you choose, save room for the cookie dessert. Your guests will love it."
1,"I can't say that I had a great experience.  \n\nI was having a particularly weird issue where my AC wouldn't turn off after reaching the set point, but this issue would come and go (usually with rain).  I was suspecting something electrical was bad, but not sure what.\n\nI called and response time was good.  He checked everything and said it all looked fine, and that it must be my thermostat.  He offered to replace it for me, and I declined.\n\nI replaced the thermostat but the issue came back after the next rain.  I ended up getting a separate issue with my other unit, and I decided to call back to have him look at both units.  He said he was really backed up and wouldn't be able to make it in a couple of days, so I called someone else (search my reviews and you'll see who).\n\nThe other HVAC tech found a litany of issues that Flores missed.  Bad caps and contactors, dry rotted fuse box, old fuses, and dry rotted thermostat wires on the roof (most likely cause of my issues after rain).  I'm happy I found someone who took the time to check everything and listen to my description of the issue.  \n\nUnfortunately, this person was not Flores A/C."
4,Fabulous experience!  Food was perfect and service was even better.  Will come again next time we're in town!
0,"I used to come here regularly. And from my rating, you can see that that has changed. The last two times I came were complete disasters. One time isn't really their fault but it tells you the type of people you may encounter (though you would probably encounter them anywhere). Anyhow, let me get back to the story. It's a laid-back place with a live band you can dance to. So I put my sweater on the speaker (which I've done many times before) so that I could dance without the extra bulk. To make the long story short, my sweater was stolen. I actually approached the girl who argued with me and ran off with it. And I'm not kidding about that. I admit I wasn't quick enough to go after her because I was in shock, I definitely did not expect that at all. The workers of course could not help. Anyhow, it sounds petty but I like that sweater and it's ridiculous that that even happened. I actually didn't come for a couple of months because I was still annoyed by that.\n\nAnyhow, I finally did decide to make another visit... Ok, so onto the actual place- food, drinks, and music. All were terrible the last time I was here. In fact, I brought some family and friends and was completely embarrassed by how bad it was. They had a new band and they were terrible. (The old band used to play the same songs but at least they did a good job). It took me a while to figure out what this new band was playing, which ended up being \""Yeah\"" by Ludacris. That's a pretty distinct song and it's bad that I couldn't even tell what they were playing! Well, since we finally found a table, we figured we'd hang out even with the terrible music. So everyone ordered their drinks. I ordered my usual margarita on the rocks. Wow, that was also terrible. Seriously, is it possible for everything to change that much in a couple of months? In fact, it became somewhat of a game as everyone tried everyone else' drink to see whose was the worst. I think mine won. Actually, I can't even comment on the food because I think we gave up after the drinks. (I used to always want the nachos but I was afraid to try that this time).\n\nSo I definitely do not recommend this place and will not come back (and haven't since these last experiences)."
1,"I'm really surprised that so many people love this place, especially when there is better middle eastern food all over this town.\n\nFirst off, I didn't really know who worked here, and who didn't, and thought it was especially rude of the gangsta busboy to cut me off and flirt with our hostess while she was seating us. Classy. \n\nThe decor is uninspired, and the service was decent. Our drinks were kept full, but I felt that our plates were thrown at us. \n\nOnto the food. We first started with the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, which was a pretty decent hummus, not as spicy as I would have liked. It was smooth\n\nMy wife had the Spicy Black Bean Burger, and I had the Falafel Pita.\n\nPresentation was nothing special, the idea of putting my foil wrapped pita on a plate seemed ridiculous, it would have made better sense to put it in a basket, or just handed it to me. As for flavor, nothing was exciting, minus the pickles, which were crisp and sour. The falafel tasted like a mix, the pita was dry and incredibly flat, the tahini was non-existent, and the way my veggies were arranged showed the general lack of care/love of food in the kitchen.\n\nThe black bean burger was much better, and is what earned the 2 stars in this review. The patty was flavorful, spicy, and great. The rest of the burger was uninspired. Vegetarian food can be absolutely amazing, and the rest of burger was a miss. \n\nShe enjoyed the included blue corn chips, but I thought they were nothing special, the salsa was salty, and the potatoes were not spiced, burnt, and really had no place or reason to be included with the meal. \n\nI certainly won't be going back, but if I could purchase just those black bean burger patties, I would."
0,"Items ordered:\n-Tom Kha soup\n-Green Curry with pork\n-Beef Nom Tok salad\n\nIt looks like we need to venture out further from the neighborhood for better Thai food. Of the several Thai restaurants we frequent in Vegas, we are disappointed with Corner Thai. We were the second table of patrons inside the eatery. The next table already had several dishes out already. It took almost 25 minutes for the soup to come out. Flavor was lacking. The curry came out next and was only lukewarm and we had to have it reheated. The curry was on the watery side and the coconut milk they use is of substandard quality as evidenced in the soup. The beef Nam Tok salad was the most satisfying dish of the trio we ordered. Both of us had to share a single bowl of rice, though we could ask for more. They should have given us one bowl of rice each.\n\nWe had a $10 off coupon which made the meal more affordable, but due to the quality, I would have been upset if I had to pay full price. To make matters worse, the credit card machine wasn't working and there was no \""cash only\"" sign. Definitely a one-visit place."
2,"My hair stylist recently recommended this place so I decided to give it a try during lunch. First thing on my mind was Thai-Sushi? Is that some kind of Asian fusion? Will I be the first person on the planet to try a Lemongrass Roll? No. It turns out the two cuisines are totally separate, one side of the menu is Thai and the other Japanese. Cuisines separated geographically by 2000 miles and several nations in between. It's kind of like Porsche making an SUV without first getting their feet wet with a sport wagon - odd, but I digress. \n\nSince this was a quick lunch during the work week it's only fitting to give you the executive summary in pure work week fashion... with bullet points. \n\nPros \n-        Great service. Keep those diet coke refills coming! \n-        Great \""to the point\"" lunch menu. After all, I had to get back to work in short order so I appreciate short lunch menus with 5-8 specials. \n-        Nice, contemporary, clean interior. Sometimes this can be the downfall of mom and pop places when trying to compete with chains that have full time \""ambiance engineers\"" \n-        Plenty of food. For 7-9 dollars on the Thai side of the menu you get salad, soup, egg roll, rice and the main course. The sushi side was a bit more for most options, but not by much. \n\nCons \n-        The food could have been better. My brown rice was slightly waterlogged (too plump/moist), and the Pad Thai was a little too greasy. For the price however I really can't complain. \n-        No fortune cookies with the bill! Blasphemy! My dogs will be very disappointed. Maybe they should make it a Thai - Sushi - Chinese place so I can get my fortune cookie.   \n\nIn short, I would go back again, this time to try the Sushi side of the menu because if they get that right, I will most likely become a regular."
3,"I was exploring the new Scottsdale Quarter having been gone since it was developed.  Among the other great choices for food was TK's Urban Tavern.  I had the previously mentioned pulled pork sandwich, and also agree it was great.\n\nI was hoping for a bit more draft beer selection at a place calling it a tavern, what they had was adequate but certainly not overwhelming. \n\nI really like the restaurant space itself, small, and built of materials that allow for conversation and people watching through the large glass windows.\n\nI'll be back but probably not tell I explore the rest of the quarter."
4,"Wow!!!   Amazing food.  Their was 5 of us and we all had different plates. Everything was over the top excellent.  I will definitely be spending more time at this, my new favorite Italian restaurant. Only one problem I had here, and that is the service was pretty slow.  I dont mind waiting for good food but I don't think the kitchen is what was holding up the dining experience."
4,"First time here this evening. I was with my 16 year old son, and we were both hungry. I read the reviews here on Yelp..I made a u- tur, parked the car..and came in. So glad we did. We ordered a bowl with brown rice and kalua pig..amazing. Everything is so fresh and tasty. They have these sauces that you can put on your food that is like a hot sauce, but better. There is Kiwi, Lime and Jalape\u00f1o, Raspberry, Agave, and Jalape\u00f1o, and Mango, Pineapple and Habanero (has a delayed kick). My son a I both liked the Mango the best. If near UNLV, stop by. You will be in for quite a treat. PS. Show your Rebel Card for a free drink."
3,"The service is subpar and the rooms are quite dingy. But if you want a room in Vegas, on the strip, in a perfect location, for extremely cheap, then IP is absolutely perfect. I stay there almost every time I go to Vegas. It's right by the monorail, so that's extremely convenient. Ya you can certainly pay triple the price elsewhere and get a nicer room, but how often are you really in your room?\n\nTry to request a low floor. The elevators are absolutely worthless!"
0,Horrible food! My nachos were ice cold asked for new and they microwaved them with the sour cream and guacamole...gag...complainec again and they made new ate a couple chips and cheese and was sick all night...\nAs a local we will never be back
4,"Whoa whoa whoa.... everclear soaked cherries?  Oh Vegas...\n\nI don't know if I recommend these, but then again I am a lightweight.  However, the Mango Rum and Strawberry Rum flavors are DELICIOUS.  Sadly I was a bit sick during my trip and couldn't indulge in Fat Tuesday as much as I would have liked.  But next time, I'm trying every flavor!!\n\nWent to the one in the MGM Grand and the one in the Forum Shops, btw.  Both were excellent in service and quality."
0,"I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience here.\n\nHadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food. Went today to see if anything has changed. Nope.\n\nGave us tots instead of fries. Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird... it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED. If this is how they make them now... um... alright. They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy. Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits. They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog. Makes it harder to eat. Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.\n\nGoodbye forever, Sonic."
0,"I'm not going to lie, the buffet itself was pretty good.  The prime rib for me was more of a highlight than the kobe flank.  \n\nBUT the wait staff were HORRIBLE!!  Our waiter brought the wrong drink and never bothered to check in on our table afterwards to see how we were doing. The plates weren't picked up in a timely manner as well.  He didn't re-fill our drinks the whole evening until...  at the end of our meal, I said to my table \""i think our waiter kind of sucked.\""  My brother and cousin were looked at me and said \""He's right behind you.\""  Ok, I might be a jerk for saying that.  He clearly heard me because he only brought my cousin back another drink.  He didn't even look at me.  Even though the service was poor, we tipped him 15%.  The money was slightly tucked under a plate and we watched him when we left.  He first thought we didn't tip him and he shot us a dirty look and gathered his other wait staff around him to watch us.  Later on he found the tip and just put it in his pocket.  Punk.  TERRIBLE WAIT STAFF make for an UNPLEASANT dining experience."
0,"Um wow. I can't believe I stayed here. I can't believe someone convinced me to stay here, and I can't believe there was a mysterious red stain that ran down from our window facing the ally down 10 floors to the ground. WHAT WAS THAT?!?! Creepy.\n\nI stayed here over CES weekend because as you know, when CES happens Vegas gets from $ to $$$$. All the hotels know the participants will pay and some will pay very well just to get a place on the strip. My friends decided to book the Fitzgerald to forgo all the expensive places on the strip and see what Fremont / downtown was really about. BIG MISTAKE.\n\nFirst, they still charged for parking. Com'on, its downtown, what the heck? Even the strip doesn't charge for parking! And it was billed to our room on a nightly basis. Second, the place was difficult to find an entrance into, I remember circling around for a while and then finding the ally way in which the garage entrance was. It also wasn't particularly easy to get to the rooms from the garage and it was a huge inconvenience with lots of luggage.\n\nFinally, the rooms ... beds are terribly hard and smells of mold. The rooms are not well lit and looked dirty, smelled dirty and made me feel dirty. The bathrooms are extremely badly ventilated and somewhat moldy. They need an update badly! What scared me the most was our elevator which was running everyone up and down had cracks in between the joints. ?!?!?! Goodness, it was an experience indeed. I would definitely not stay here, nor downtown again."
2,I've only been here a few times.  \nBut I never feel cool enough when I go.
4,Love this place ! Food\nIs so authentic and the service is not bad at all ! Definitely recommend this to everyone
2,"Tried the Fajita Chicken and Beef mixed, is one of the best I tried. Other foods though are OK. Servings are huge!!"
4,"Took some friends from out of town here the other week and they really enjoyed it.  In fact I always take all out of towners here.\n\nHarlow's is still one of my favorite places to eat breakfast, except the parking is terrible.  I know we have been over this and all of Tempe near ASU has terrible parking so I will move on.  The wait staff are always really friendly and keep your coffee filled constantly while you are here.  The restaurant is the definition of greasy spoon with the pictures of famous people on the paneled walls.  If that is not your thing and you need a $tarbucks atmosphere you should probably pass.  If you get over it then you will have a really great breakfast.\n\nOn to why I updated my review.  I ordered the Eggs Maxamillion on my last visit since I am vegetarian now so I couldn't go for my usual standby of Chip Beef. It was one of the best breakfast items I have had since I moved here.  It's hash browns with green chillies ( order them extra crispy ), sitting on a tortilla, topped with a fluffy egg omelet covered in salsa.  It's Huevos Rancheros on crack.  I will be adding this to the breakfast rotation now even though it is a bit of a haul.\n\nTry:\n- Eggs Maxamillion\n- Chip beef\n- Hash Browns ( Extra Crispy )"
3,Really great all around good reliable restaurant.food very good good servce..in particular our waitress was so tolerant with us as we waited for a very late friend who was meeting us.we sat on patio and took the table for quite a bit.she was very nice about it.we all had breakfast and every bite was a pleasure.
3,"Definitely a fan. The waitress was sweet and accommodating. The salsa and chips, with a seasoning, are great. As for the entrees, the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte! The only reason I didn't rate Three Amigos a five is because the timing. We waited a while for the entrees, but they were worth it. Will definitely be back!"
1,"I was staying at Hooters and decided at try out Mad Onion after a 1am dip in the pool...I ordered the 10-piece wings and fries for $7.95, and my husband ordered one of the $2.99 breakfast specials. The food was great...although the fries were spicier than the wings which was weird...but the service was HORRIBLE. this was a Tuesday night...or shall i say Wednesday morning...and it wasnt packed. there was maybe 4 other tables with people and I saw 2 other servers besides ours. Yet the only time I actually saw our server was when he took our order. Someone from the kitchen brought our food. And after about 15 minutes and deciding I wanted to just get a box and go to my room, I realized no one had checked on us. After sitting there annoyed for about another 5 minutes I finally just told my husband to go ask the seating hostess for our check and a box to go. which took another 5 minutes to get. I'm usually not picky about service but this one ticked me off."
2,"This is a nice little place that does a good job. I had the lunch special which consists of a sandwich, pita chips, and a small drink for around $5.75. The price is right! Their bread is great! It's like a soft ciabatta bread and it tastes homemade. Overall, this is a really good little place and I would reccomend it;  but there are a few problems that I saw.\n\n1. They charge you for putting cheese on your sandwich. It's a deli sandwich! I appreciate the low prices, but give me a break. Throw a slice of swiss on it.\n\n2. It comes with their homemade pita chips that are actually pretty good, but they are all broken little peices and you only get three or four of those broken little peices. \n\n3. No deli mustard, honey mustard, or any other tangy sauce that could \""kick it up a notch.\"" Maybe they are coming later, but a little deli mustard at a sandwich place doesn't seem to be asking for too much."
4,"Hands down the best Indian Buffet I've had (out of a dozen or so).  1st I've seen here for a buffet:: _fresh_ garlic naan delivered to table, mango lassi, _thick_ sauces, mango pickle didn't cost extra, and buffet at dinner (not just lunch).  On top was good service, a nice number of vegetarian and meat dishes, and 4 or 5 desert options on the buffet."
1,"I've been here once, after hearing friends rave about this place. The line was long, but on Black Friday, not a surprise. When it was finally my turn to order, the staff was helpful and explained to me what a \""flat white\"" is. I went with a cappucino and a peach tart. The cappucino looked pretty but tasted burnt. The tart was tasteless, unfortunately. It seems clean and the atmosphere is nice but the coffee makes me want to go somewhere else."
0,"Food tastes like frozen food.\n\nService was good but delivery of food VERY SLOW (about an hour to get pasta).\n\nManager (Dan) will try to blame you if you have any issue like we did with the slowness of your food.\n\nOther than that, it was awesome."
3,Not bad buffet. Got omellets that a cook will cook it for you yum. :)
3,"I just had to review SR in Glendale.\n\nUnlike the Sunset Strip location the people here are warm, inviting and overly friendly. \n\nThe happy hour rocks and the food won't leave you hungry by any means!"
3,"Taking my friends out for a night, we decided to park and just walk around the casinos.  We stumbled into this place while we waited for some more people and even though it wasnt a hip bar or a classy place, I loved it!  The DJ on Friday night was awesome. He played great music and if it was more of a dance place, I would have totally been on the dance floor!  If you are into beer pong, this is the place for you!!!!!!!  Lots of beer pong tables, pool tables and video games. The drinks were half the price then the other and the bartender made them nice and strong! \nMy only complaint were the bathrooms were disgusting, I do not think they had been cleaned for a week!  \nEverything else was great!  Looking forward to going back!"
1,"I ordered the Billionaire burger with sweet potato fries. I had high hopes from the reviews and was anxious to try a burger with foie gras. How can a burger that cost $28 with foie gras let me down? Unfortunately it did.\n\nWorth a try, but I wouldn't be back.\n\nThe highlight of my meal: the sweet potato fries."
0,"Not a good experience.... I stayed at the end of June for two nights while I was visiting for a job interview. The night before my interview the AC in my room was working very poorly and I woke up a midnight because of the heat. Imagine being stuck ina hotel with no AC in Phoenix! I called the front desk and they offered to move me to a room but I was already in bed and had all of my dress clothes laid out. As if I wanted to have to pick up everything a move! \n\nThey offered to cut my rate in half, let me drink the water from the mini fridge, and gave me a fan (an extremely loud one). The next morning my statement didn't reflect the rate change so I checked my credit card statement later and I was still charged the full amount.\n\nI had to dispute the charge through Wells Fargo and even then I had to actually call the hotel finance department. Still no resolution! Not good customer service and not a good experience."
1,"The room was nothing extraordinary, typical hotel room with an eyesore of popcorn ceilings. The 'heavenly bed' was extremely firm and caused both my husband and I back pain. We were so dissatisfied with the bed we left a night early. \n\nThe pool was better than average and very clean. The grounds were well kept up and the staff was very nice. They had live music on Friday night which I wish we had been made aware of upon check in since the music went quite late and we could clearly hear it from our room.\n\nWe went with a gift card and were happy to have not have had to pay for this. I can't say I would go back to the Westin, just didn't think it was worth the money.\n\nThe Agave spa, while being quite pricy for the quality, was fine and the locker area was relaxing and exactly what I expected. This was the highlight of my trip."
2,"I have been to all four Bouchon and I was extremely disappointed when I came to this one. Even thought I had gonne last year, and it was very good, this time, it was not so good.\n\nThe service was not there, the goodness of the food was not there, maybe the Chef was off that day because nothing was right.\n\nMy food came out cold, I didn't complain, because my boyfriend asked me not to, so I ate it, and enjoyed it. \n\nIt was not bad, it was good, but not like, wow, it was good.  \n\nI had the croque madame, a dish that I've had at Bouchon in Yountville. the morney sauce was bland, the sandwich was cold and so where my fries. I waited a long time for it too, then I had a salad that I've had in Yountville and in Beverly Hills, and this one was wilted, and not good. \n\nMaybe it was a bad day, I don't know, but I will give it one more try in Las Vegas, I still believe in Thomas Keller and will not give up on him."
1,"Not my favorite. I didn't really know what to expect in Cuban food, but I do know that I had it one memorable time at Cha Cha Cha in Haight -Ashbury, San Francisco, so I was excited to see a fun looking Cuban restaurant near my new place. However, it was a little bit bland for my liking, literally lacking in taste. I could see potential for the atmosphere being fun with mojitos and dancing in the late hours, but it's a no for dinner. I had the \""camarones al ajillo\"" which are large prawns sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and white wine. Didn't taste like anything I couldn't make myself.  My date ordered \""lechon asado\"" which was a slow-roasted pork dish, but again totally lacking in flavor, with just a boring side of rice and beans. My favorite was the cuban sandwich appetizer with plantain chips, tasty, but not something I've been craving ever since. Sorry Havana Grill, you have yet to impress"
1,"D\u00f6nerbude direkt gegen\u00fcber der UNI bzw. des KIT.\n\n\n Habe dort einen Yufka D\u00f6ner gegessen und war einigerma\u00dfen zufrieden. Geschmacklich war er in Ordnung, wenn auch nicht die Offenbarung.\n\n\n Was mir nicht gefallen hat war:\n- Der Preis von EUR 4,00. Nicht gerade ein Schn\u00e4ppchen. \n- Die Tatsache, dass nach dem Kassieren mein D\u00f6ner ohne die H\u00e4nde zu waschen gerollt wurde. Mag ich einfach nicht, zumal neben der Kasse ein Waschbecken ist. Ansonsten ist der Laden aber sauber und hinter der Theke sieht es auch gut aus."
2,"The service was great (for the most part). There was a young lady holding the door open for customers and helping them with the menu/process, which is nice. The girl working the soup counter was very pleasant, but the group of kids working the salads and sandwiches were kind of rude.\n\nThe lobster bisque is phenomenal. I like that you can actually get a whole sandwich with a salad or soup for the \""You Choose Two\"" deal. The sandwiches are a lot smaller than the sandwiches at Paradise Bakery, though. I thought that the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad was delicious.\n\nIt was $18 for two salads, a whole sandwich and a cup of lobster bisque. Not terrible price wise."
0,"We're die hard Fatburger fans and stop in every time we're in Las Vegas.  Tonight we stopped in and found that the place has been completely renovated - no issue with that, it looks a lot better.  \nThe only thing that was not better was the food!  The decline in quality was not what we expected but neither was the sharp increase in prices!  $30 bucks for 2 burgers and fries is too much to pay for a strip mall burgers.  \nWe won't be back anytime soon."
3,What can you say about a Casino. Pretty much what he name says. Not sure if you get free drinks I was here for about two hour and I was never offered one. They did have free sodas but you had to get them.
3,"One of the few highlights of the Fremont Street area.  It's like a Wall Street type steakhouse, with friendly staff and good food.  \n\nIt doesn't rate 4 stars on a national level, but it's head and shoulders above the competition within a 5 mile radius of Fremont St."
3,"Stayed in August 2011 so bear in mind things have changed since then.\n\nWe were a party of 6 aged 17-65 and had two adjoining rooms and a separate third room all on the same floor as requested. Rooms were clean and spacious and AC worked well. Nice sized bathrooms and plenty of towels provided.\n\nWe liked this hotel as it wasn't as daunting as some of the others on the strip, it wasn't a huge walk from the entrance to the elevators and a short walk to the room. There was minimal noise at night (our room had a partial strip view - Planet Hollywood and you could also see the pool)\n\nWe ate most mornings at MAG (separate review) and also in Le Burger and the buffet. Enjoyed almost daily happy hours at the bar in the casino, great 2-4-1 Martinis - super strong."
1,"Seriously lacking as a beer bar.  Go downtown Champaign to the Blind Pig, Piglet, or several other places.  Crane Ally or Black Dog in Urbana.  \n\nSeriously lacking as a pizza spot as well.  Go to Papa Del's for Chicago pizza.  The rest of the menu is typical for any chain.  Which has that sterile and boring chain vibe that makes me want to shoot myself.  Ugh, two stars cause they try to have a decent beer list, and a cheep lunch buffet that is slightly better than Cicis."
3,"After reading many reviews on Yelp and my like of Sushimon we decided to try this sushi place a few days ago.  I enjoyed the pork belly, good flavor. Also, the fish tasted fresh and I appreciated that they didn't put large mounds of rice as many of the other AYCE places seem to. I generally like just sushi but they appeared to have a variety of rolls and a lot of california rolls for people who prefer to not eat the fish I enjoyed the Green Tea Creme Brulee and would get that again. I didn't catch our sushi chef's name but I would go back to him, he was quite but very attentive and quick. I didn't enjoy some of the loud and obnoxious patrons however that is not the fault of the restaurant. \n\nOverall, if I was in the area I would go back."
0,"Meh, Imperial Dump sucks. \n\nEverything was an issue. Will not return.  Maintenance had to fix the door and snake the bath tub because it was all clogged up. Room was not cleaned every night, and bed sheets were never changed during stay. Front Desk ignored instructions and was clueless as to how the room numbering works. Most of the workers here I found to be surly.  The elevator is super slow and a little scary. Whole place is dirty, dated, falling apart, and under construction."
2,"I pass by this place EVERY day on the way to work and I've always been curious if it was good or not. My Dad and I even stopped in once, but the place was packed and there were several lines arching throughout the restaurant, so we walked out in favor of the Riviera food court, which is NEVER busy.\n\nThis time around, the joint was practically dead. I quickly found out that you don't go to the desk with the cash register first, but straight up to the counter in front of the kitchen. I ended up ordering the Taco El Adodaba (Spicy Pork), the Taco Asada (Steak) and a Asade Quesadilla. With a bottle of water, the bill roughly came out to $11 or so.\n\nI am a VERY plain eater when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I usually am the person who will order a burrito with only meat, cheese, rice and maybe potatoes inside. These tacos were slathered with guacamole, onions and salsa. I did remove the copious amounts of guacamole, but I actually thought the combination of all of the toppings and the meat tasted pretty good! That's saying something when a plain person like myself can enjoy such loaded food.\n\nThis joint is a little bit different in the fare you would expect from a Mexican place as well. They don't have rice, beans or chips...and the quesadilla is definitely different than ANY other place I've had one before. I can only describe it as a small tortilla with meat and cheese in the middle with a corn chip on top of it. It was different, but not bad at all."
2,"I had heard really good things about Bubba's.  So many things, in fact, that we made the trek all the way up to the place just to get some.  I won't say that we came away disappointed, but we weren't exactly impressed either.\n\nThe building itself made me think of the husk of an old Pizza Hut.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  It just did.  On the inside it was like everything had been stripped out and tables thrown in like we were at a fish camp.  Not a bad like for a barbecue joint, but I don't really care what the tables look like.  I just thought it worth mentioning.\n\nWe found the staff to be very nice - in fact, they were the highlight of the trip (other than the man v. boy urinal: be sure to check it out).\n\nAs to the food, however, there are a number of places that have better barbecue, and most of them are a much closer drive.  I'd probably go to Spoon's for something similar but better, and keep McKoy's at the top of my list (if you can get it fresh)."
0,"I understand that all theaters are known to have high concession stand prices.  I have NO issue with that.  I know that when I purchase something.  BUT to be charged $4 for a cup (that is typically filled with soda) - a SMALL cup at that - is ridiculous.  Then, the manager had the audacity to say \""well why didn't you ask for a complimentary cup\"" - I was put over the edge.  This was my first - and LAST visit to the waterworks theater.  I, sadly, can not read minds, so did not know a complimentary cup was available.  Especially when I asked for a bottled water and she offered to give me a cup of water/ice instead.  A bottled water (16 oz) is $3.75.  A cup of water (Under 10 oz) is $4.  The manager was not helpful, just said \""sucks to be you\"".  REALLY?\n\nI tried not to pay for it, but all i had was a $10.  I asked for a receipt and she told me that the machine was out of tape and could not provide me with a receipt.  \n\nThe customer service all in all was terrible.  The idea that they charged $4 for a cup of water is ridiculous and appalling.  Yes, I recognize that it was my fault for buying something at the concession stand.  But seriously - WATER.  A cup of water."
2,"Being a visitor in the city, the first thing I wanted to do was hang out in Shadyside, and of course a part of that was stuffing my face with cupcakes.  \n\nEnter CoCo's cupcakes!  Here what I liked:\n~ The cupcakes!  They were tasty\n~ The variety...about 10 different cupcakes to choose from\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n~ Sad space....very bare with no music going...it felt like church!\n~ No containers!  My \""to go\"" cupcake got smashed.  Don't worry folks, I still ate it!\n\nAll in all, not a bad cupcake spot."
4,"One of the best and least expensive gyms around. I pay $10 a month and it has everything I need. Good machines, plenty of cardio equipment, a squat rack, a pool, and lots of free weights. \n\nI have looked at several gyms in my area and this one was hands-down the best in price and options!"
4,"Zombie Burlesque is an excellent show.  From beginning to end this show was entertaining.  I would say the writing is clever and crude at the same time.  Each act was great, but I believe the host made the show shine.   \n\nIf you want a show in Vegas that won't break the bank and is really entertaining, Zombie Burlesque is it."
4,If you like crab claws then this is the place for you.  Holy shit the claws are huuge!  See in my pictures.  Really good place and it's in Vegas so you know it's fine dining at it's best.  The lobster bisque wasn't bad either.
2,"I give 3.5 to 4 stars for food. But for service, it is probably a 2-star or less for me. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nBeing Chinese, I know service is never the forte of an authentic Chinese restaurant. But I was still surprised at the lack of service and the total carelessness and cluelessness there. First, they don't seem to care which table orders what so the orders frequently got mixed up when I was there; the server would carry the food and wander around from table to table, asking if anyone ordered this. So I had to watch the plates whenever the server carried them out from the kitchen and stopped her to give mine to me, because the server was walking AWAY from me with my food on her tray. \n\nSecond, they started making dumplings 40 minutes after I ordered them. After the dumplings were finally ready, because they forgot who ordered it or simply did not care to check, they let it sit on the side table behind the cashier for another 15 minutes. Our dumplings were finally uncovered when the owner saw the dumplings sitting in the cashier area and started talking loudly in Chinese, \""Whose dumplings are these?\"" I had to raise my hand to claim them. So we got our dumplings after we finished our meal and were about to pay the bill.\n\nThird, it was difficult to get hold of a server/owner to ask if the dish was coming out anytime soon. They rushed by your table and never made any eye contact. They don't come by your table and fill your water diligently, or check on your order. The owner was especially warm and hospitable to her acquainted clientele when I was there, but was quite indifferent to others (I guess I shouldn't be surprised how they selectively treat people... in the Chinese way).\n\nFOOD:\n\nIn terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality.\n\nWe ordered \n\n(1) Spicy Braised Beef Combination (in Chinese, \""sliced lung by the married couple,\"" a dish in chili oil, toasted peanuts, and cilantro with a mixture of beef slices and various beef parts, including stomach--it sounds gross but I dare you to try it). The best dish we got that night. To me, it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province. But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U.S. don't normally serve, even though this is a STANDARD appetizer in almost any restaurant in China.\n\n(2) Lamb skewer. Pretty disappointed. It has the similar cumin rub as the ones I would buy from the Xinjiang Uyghur vendors on a street cart in China. But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible: it was predominantly fat and connective tissues, and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked.\n\n(3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, \""water-fried beef buns\""). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough.\n\n(4) Soybean Paste Noodle (a soupless \""mix-it-yourself\"" cold noodle with cubed ham, sliced cucumber, and a soybean meat sauce). It was extremely basic. The noodle was an alkaline noodle, so it was yellower and more elastic than the average soup noodles. It was a filling dish, but nothing special, and quite bland.\n\n(5) Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage. Yes these are the dumplings that came grossly late so we had to box all of them. For 5 bucks they were great, much better than the ones from the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store. But they were NOT worth the 1.5+ hour wait. I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious, not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers. But if they don't come at the end of your meal, you should probably cancel the order.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent Chinese eatery with some management/service issues. I saw some items on the menu that I don't usually see elsewhere and they are quite good. But still, these are basic, entry-level Chinese food items that are quick to prepare and hard to mess up. I would probably come back and hope to see an improvement in the structureless service."
2,"decided to try their red velvet - which i think is a good indicator of how good a cupcake/bakery really is. the frosting was really mouth wateringly delicious, but the actual cake part was a bit dry to my standards.\n\nthe place is really cute inside. splashes of neon colors inside make it look cool. the cupcakes are also displayed quite nicely also. wish i tried one more of their cupcakes..."
2,Ok.  This used to be our favorite spot in the area but the past two times we have been here were not the best.   Today's meal was cold burnt and  rubbery.  We had fish and chips.  Burnt mushy fish and cold over cooked chips.  Loaded potato soup was so thick you could use it for paste.  The app we had was the best part of the meal.   \n\nThe last time we wets here my fianc\u00e9 got food poisoning from a burger special.   \n\nI'm beginning to think we need to go elsewhere from now on.
0,Overcrowded market. Nothing worth a crap. Overpriced with no real selection. \nDirty as well.
0,"I attempted to check out this doughnut shop on two separate occasions. Arrival was within their noted business hours, approximately an hour before close. This shop was closed on each attempt with a sign reading, \""Out of Donuts\"". These donuts may be good, but the business is poorly operated. They are in the business of forecasting, producing, and selling donuts... Yet they ran out of product on not one, but two different occasions. To say the least, I will not be attempting this again."
2,I had the three ring binder burger since I love onion rings but didn't want to order the actual onion rings appetizer because that was too much to consume. The burger was alright but could be better. I liked the pyrex style cups since it had a novelty factor but that's it.
2,"We had a big meal...Thai eggrolls, level 3 chicken curry and pad see ew, level 0 orange chicken, chicken pad Thai levels 7 and 10.  Eggrolls were good but tiny, curry was spicy, pad see ew was delish, orange chicken was nearly rock hard, and pad Thai was good.  Level 10 was too much and my hubby will dial back next time.  A lucky Yelp find near our home."
4,I could not have asked for better service. Alex was very polite and helpful on the phone.The food from UPs restaurant was excellent and was delivered right on time by a very polite and friendly deliveryman. I would highly recommend Happy Bellies and look forward to using them in the future.\n\nNancy D.B.
4,"I absolutely ADORE this place. I get the Pho Tai on a regular basis and it's always excellent. The hot and sour fish, described below, is also fantastic. Don't miss the fried egg rolls (from the Vietnamese menu). \n\nI've tried more dishes here than I can remember, and have always been pleased with what I ordered. The vegetables are always crisp and fresh, the seafood super fresh! This is the only place I'll eat shrimp. Great clams, too!! \n\nOne of the things I like best about this restaurant, though, is the service. Not only is it fast, thorough, and friendly, but unlike some other restaurants in Chinatown here, the waitstaff is always willing to help me find some new menu items to try. They could care less than I'm American--they take pride in their food and enjoy introducing customers to new dishes.\n\nI have a very limited budget, but whenever I eat out, this is my first choice. It is so reasonably priced, that I can get there without sacrificing in other areas of my life."
4,"I love checking reviews of businesses on Yelp, but I have never written one prior to now. I had to write a review about Automotion. I brought my car in recently before making a long trip, and unfortunately needed some repairs. Sean, the owner, was able to take care of everything. They were completely honest, and even gave me ideas on how to save some money. They let me know which work needed to be done prior to my trip, and which work could wait to be performed. It is rare to find a mechanic you feel you can trust, but I felt that Sean was completely honest with me. My service and the work performed were A+. I would definitely recommend you take a look here, for all your car repair/maintenance needs."
3,"I LOVE CANE'S!!!\n\nI've been to this location a million times, and the quality of the food is stellar.  \nI love the Texas Toast, and the Cane's sauce is awesome.  \n\nSweet tea is great too. \n\nAnd the Chicken?  Awesome. \n\n:D"
2,"We go there for lunch a lot on the weekends. Close to the house. Love the calamari with the special dipping sauce. The club sandwich with taro chips is yummy and can be split between two people. Other things we like are the chopped salad, flat breads and sushi. Had the Hawaiian rib eye for a special occasion with mashed potatoes and broccolini topped with a grilled pineapple and it was delightful. Service can be a disappointment (maybe just Sat. lunches). They seem to be there when you do not need them and not there when you need them. On a few occasions we had to ask for some small plates while sharing a starter or desert. You would think they would just bring them automatically rather than watching you drop food all over the table while trying to get it in your mouth. Just ask for extra plates ahead of time and chopsticks if you wish. They have them. I'll be back!"
0,"I used this business for my wedding and the professionalism and product was exactly what I paid for: cheap!  \n\nProblem 1: Although I paid for a trial prior to my big day, the woman who did my trial was not the same woman who actually did my makeup on my big day.  What is the point of spending money and time for a trial if someone I have never met ends up just winging it the morning of the event?  The woman who did my hair in the trial was the same woman who did my hair on my wedding day; however, she looked at me and queried, \""How did I do your hair again during the trial?\""  Again, it is her professional responsibility to work with the client and remember what we had decided.  My hair did turn out pretty, but it was completely different from the day of the trial.  Although it was beautiful, it went quite flat and when I look at pictures, I notice that there were sections she simply did not curl.   \n\nProblem 2: She said she would arrive with her two \""assistants\"" to help with the rather large bridal party.  By \""assistant,\"" she meant her pre-teen daughter.  That's right. . .she brought her daughter who is in Junior High to do hair!  Her daughter was very sweet and well-mannered, but we would have been better off keeping our cash and doing our own hair.  The second \""assistant\"" was her sister.  I do not believe she has any professional expertise or training.  \n\nProblem 3: Three of my bridesmaids had to re-do their hair.  The only skill these women seemed to have mastered is the curling iron.  Yet, the curls went flat within a couple of hours.  One of my bridesmaid's asked her to touch up the flattened curls, to which the \""hair artist,\"" retorted, \""Your hair just isn't the kind of hair that will curl.\""  My bridesmaid has beautiful, lush wavy hair.\n\nIf you are looking to save money with this as an alternative to other pricier travel make-up artists or a salon, my advice is to keep the money and recruit girlfriends or relatives to do your make-up/hair.  It's about the same level of professionalism, service and expertise.  This is the ONLY thing I would have changed about my wedding."
4,I have taken plenty of items to her for over a decade and have been pleased every time.  She has taken good shirts and made new collars and cuffs from extra material from the bottom.  If that option was not available she then put contrasting collar and cuffs on.  She has taken out and taken in dozens of pants.  She has recut shirts for me. Her prices have always been reasonable.\n\nddc
3,"I received a gift certificate to Citizen Public House for my birthday so I decided to take a few friends. The food was great and the service was even better. They even gave me a drink on the house for bringing people in. The cocktails are good but not the best, the drinks are much better upstairs. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good place to eat/drink in the Old Town Scottsdale area."
0,"I called Chanel at Wynn 10/26/11 in the afternoon and asked if I could exchange an item I bought at chanel.com.  The sales rep said it would be fine as long as I have a receipt.  Awesome.  \nSo, I left right away and drove from the north side of town, which is quite a distance, to exchange the product.  When I gave the brunette in charge of make-up my powder and receipt, she went to the back to speak with the manager and came back and told me she could not exchange my product and I would have to ship it back.  I got frustrated, of course, because I was just told it would be fine and I just drove a long distance, WHICH I explained to her, and this is what she said, \""I apologize but it is what it is...\"" .  She didn't even care and did not even try to pull some strings for me, considering the situation.  I left very angry.  \nSince I was in the area I called Chanel at Belagio and asked if they would do it.  Guess what?  They did it.\nShows the character of the girl in charge of make-up at Chanel at Wynn.  She knew I was misinformed and I I took a long drive to get there and she didn't even care.  That is just messed up."
3,"I came here two years ago with the fam and it has been *The* restaurant that's left us salivating for more. This time, we came for the brunch offered on weekends. Brunch comes with pita, pickles, coffee/juice, and a different menu- although normal menu is available too. The standout dishes were the baba ghanoush and fattouch salad. The bg came garnished with pomegranate seeds and parsley- it was vibrant and chunky. The roasted eggplant flavor beamed through in each bite. The fattouch salad was perfectly dressed. I particularly liked the scallions and thinly sliced radishes in the mix. \n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes- my mom can't not have lamb when it is available- the brunch kawarma and one of the specialty keftas, the grenadine one. The kawarma was a ground lamb baked under eggs. The kefta was a little bit tougher than I remember it being the last time. Biggest complaint is that the entrees don't come with rice so we ordered it separately. Nevertheless, there was free flowing pita to sop up the sauce.\n\nAnd for non-French speakers, they offer an English menu!"
4,Paradise bakery desert ridge\nGreat customer service replace cookies that were accidentally thrown out\nThx
1,"I went to see O 5 years ago and almost fell asleep. Yes it was cool but the storyline was too boring.  We decided to give Ka a chance tonight. The stage was amazing, it floated, rotated, you name it... The performers were also great. Why the 2 stars? It was boring. The storyline was slow and too much of people flying around on ropes. The music was in language I didn't understand and it was all just too dramatic for my personal choice. I'm officially giving up on cirque."
2,"The food was okay.  The atmosphere is 50's diner.  Not actually very pleasant.  I used a Deal Chicken which was very deceiving, which I suppose was the fault of Deal Chicken and not the restaurant. Be careful if you purchase one of these \""deals.\"" It leads you to believe you are getting $15 off of a $30 purchase, and that you have to spend $30. When I presented the voucher, I was informed it was only $7.50 off of two separate dining visits. In retrospect, I don't know that we would've had to spend $30 to use the voucher.  All-in-all very confusing, so be careful."
4,LOVE - LOVE - LOVE Frances!!!\nIt is one of those stores that can cheer you up.  You will be able to find a unique and fun item.  I get many compliments on the jewelry that I purchase there and it is not overpriced.
0,A family member recently was sent to this facility after a joint replacement. Bottom line: You could die in there and nobody would notice for several hours.
1,"Weeknight 'prime rib' buffet \n\nNot someplace I would recommend but if you have points and can eat for free off your points, it works. No-frills extremely casual never very busy buffet. Do not expect to be wowed with any gourmet items or 'real' seafood (crawfish and inexpensive fish). The salad bar was decent - fresh greens and enough fixings to make a good salad. The prime rib was okay. The desserts were the highlight and loved that you could get 'fresh' slices out of the display case vs. pre-sliced dried out pieces on plates like most buffets. Tried the german chocolate, regular chocolate, chocolate mousse, and carrot cakes and they were all solid. Staff was friendly."
4,"Great old school, cheap breakfast place.  Small standard menu you can't really go wrong on, hit up the cinnamon raisin toast too."
3,"Well Bobby Flay does it again. Second or third time at this great Restaurant in Ceasars Las Vegas. Place was very crowded and we were unable to make a reservation earlier in the day because it was booked. After the Greenbay game we thought we would Celebrate and try Bobbies again. \nStill booked but we found a comfortable lounge seat in the Lounge(smile). Right away we were treated with the best service, and was served the best meal we've experienced in a long time. \nSo thanks to Bobby and his wonderful staff for a great Celebration in Mesa Grill."
0,"I'm not just hating because of the skimpy outfits (that most of the women don't have the body to pull off)...the food's just bad. I was excited to see something go in where Earl's was because it has a great outdoor space (even though it's right off the freeway) and went shortly after they opened, but was quite underwhelmed. I have heard they have a great TV set up to watch football games though."
3,"This is one of the hotels in vegas I always get stay for free. In that case, there's not much to complain. They really know how to take care their VIP customers... They got one of the hottest club in vegas Jet nighclub close next to the lobby area. It's so convinient to stay there, go back to your room after partying. other than that they have couple pretty nice bars & lounges too.  \ntheir 2 bedroom penthouse suite is absolutely beautiful.. great for families & b-day parites.  beautiful view too. I really enjoyed staying there, and definitly I will go back ."
4,Excellent sushi & surprisingly great service! I will definitely be going back.
0,"Afer my final alerations appointment yesterday...this place gets 1 star. \n\nWaited 15 mins before being helped when I had appointment at 6. \n\nWas told at previous appointment by one of the alterations ladies to leave my veil and slip with the dress and the slip was lost and somehow I was being blamed for this. \n\nThe alterations lady helping me was extremely rude to my wedding planner! No excuse me or please just \""move!\""and \""Get out of the way!\"" I know right?! Rude!  \n\nI was also rushed out of my dress so she could stitch something because \""I need to go home\"". Who says that to a customer?! \n\nI waa given a new slip and apologized to by two managers and even though my first two appointments were worth 5 stars this one experience is enough to make me never go back or recommend anyone here."
0,When a customer ask for napkins it is possible they need more than the two you so kindly reminded me were in my bag. (Rude). It just so happens that YOU over filled my drink and it spilled. But I won't let your poor interactions with your customer navigate my day.  The one star rating will let my people know;)
0,"\""Worst meal I ever ate\"" says my 4 yr old daughter. My wife and I agreed with her. The wings were so overcooked, they were nearly impossible to separate the chicken from the bone.  Strangely enough, my daughter is keeling over in pain and my wife just puked 3 times, despite eating the most overdone wings we've ever had. \n\nThey total redid the interior and got rid of the fun arcade games my daughter and I used to play here. Instead, they run an insanely loud game that was so loud I couldn't even hear what my wife ordered. \n\nThe only redeeming thing was that the waitress was nice."
0,"Next time I want to party with my mom this is where I will go, because every single person in there aside from the people at my table were old enough to be my parents. And most of them were apparently swingers.. \n\nLovely. \n\n50+ year old husband/wife swappers looking to score.. The mental pictures are scarring my mind. Excuse me while I barf.\n\nAnyway a few friends met up here to watch some football and drink some cheap beer. Who knew it would turn into Beerfestival 2009 accompanied by way too many shots of Jameson. I think this is the only way we all could stand the atmosphere. To top it off the food was not good at all, my Chicken Chimi tasted a little bit like vomit and the sampler was pretty much a roasted pineapple slice with a mound of hard potato strings and 3 overcooked shrimp on skewers growing out of it. To top it off, I was in the ladies room with 25 cougars and a mouse ran across the floor.. imagine 25 half naked 50 year old women bouncing up and down, arms flailing and screaming at the top of their lungs.. because that is what was going on. Ridiculous. \n\nI will only go back here if Georgie S. drags me here again for drunken football debauchery.. otherwise, count me out."
2,"Ling & Louie's is quite alright... nothing that leaves me instantly craving a return trip; but good enough that I'm really glad to have tried it. \n\nWe started off by trying a couple of their appetizers; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp. Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed. I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though. For our main dish we split the \""F'n Sliders\"" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak. They weren't too bad, but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob. The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy but very flavorful. This is the type of place that'd probably work a little better with more of a Pei-Wei's type of set up,,, it has more of a casual, almost bar-like atmosphere... it doesn't feel like you're at an Asian restaurant when you're here. \n\nIn the end... it's a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just didn't wow me like it could have. Still it's a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try. 3.5/5."
2,"Every now and then I get a hankering for Chinese food for lunch, and order takeout from here. I used to have to call, but now you can order (and pay) through their website.  However, after having order via the website today (with pick up time selected as \""ASAP\""), I will call in the future.\n\nI ordered pork with garlic sauce, white rice and egg drop soup.  Normally when I order takeout (via telephone), it is ready by the time I get there to pick it up (just a few minute walk from my office).  Today, however, I arrived to pick it up. And waited.  After the cashier asked my name/order, I saw him furiously scribble something down on an order pad then walk back to \""check\"" on my order. I don't think they checked their web order, and my order had been sitting there without going back to the kitchen.\n\n25 minutes after the timestamp on my order confirmation email, the food was ready.  \nThat's an enternity for Chinese take-out.\n\nThe food is good, fresh and a nice portion size. But I ordered take out because I didn't want to wait and sit down somewhere"
3,"It perplexes me that I've been to Hong Kong Vintage so often and yet to this date I have still not offered a review of this joint. It is the epitome of hipster. When you open the door that \""dream of the 90s is alive\"" song from Portlandia plays in your mind only the location is Hong Kong. And of course I don't mean the city you dunce!\n\nClothes alone could span an entire review here. They've got everything you can imagine that fits the era. Think turtle necks, high waist jeans and wide belts to name just a few things. Western gear is in good representation too with tons of belts, buckles, boots, cowfolk shirts and denim. Fabrics representative of the time can be found on dresses, skirts and scarves. It's so positively Laverne & Shirley and the Happy Days (this day is ooooours oh happy days!).\n\nProbably my most favorite items that they feature here would be the furniture, dishware and jewelry though. It really sets the theme as you enter the store and brings you straight back to the time period. They really stick to the era too and once told me they won't even consider giving you store credit for an item if it's not at least 20 years old. It's worth having a look-see and I try to bring any interested Charlotte visitors by here when they're in town too."
3,"You can tell this a fairly new hotel. It was pretty clean. \n\nThe location was good, next to a lot of shopping center, restaurants and a gas station. \n\nWe loved the nice courtyard with all the beautiful plants and a gazebo."
2,This location has always been pretty good.  The food is fresh and tasty and the service is great!  I don't go here often but when I do they have the gluten free menu readily available for me and they know what items are on it (or I'm lucky and get the right waiters!)  Love the lunch combos!  Great value!
3,"LOVE LOVE LOVE.\n\nFirst of all, I loved the atmosphere of this place. It was warm and comfortable feeling, almost like you were in someones house, if that makes sense? We went on the first night it was open again for summer and I was very happy to see how busy it was! \n\nThe food was amazing. A friend had recommended the cheese curds which I had 1.) never tried before and 2.) thought was a really random dish to have at a restaurant. So good! We followed that up with the lobster macaroni and cheese (A MUST), and also ordered the chicken and waffles. Our server explained that the plates were meant to share which I LOVE because we got to try so many things. I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to come back with a group of people. This is definitely a good date spot for sure."
3,"This place has a new owner/operater named Dennis he's really cool and cleared out the old satff and rude servers mentioned in these other reviews, and brought the prices down to a more reasonable level,Blusushi is now EXACTLY what it should be,delicious food,friendly servers in a stylish setting,the drinks are made right the sushi is awesome. check it out ,We'll be going back for sure :-)"
2,"It's true that the bathrooms are teeny. It's true that the hotel feels a little dated. But I've stayed here twice and had pleasant experiences both times. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly. I would probably put it at 3.5 stars if possible. Given the brand, I feel like it should be better than it is. Certainly, if I were paying sticker price for the room, I would be disappointed. (I booked through Priceline.) There are newer hotels close by with similar rates."
2,"How to review a theatre? Hmmm...well....I never waited in line to use the restroom. Gotta love that. The bartenders seem to know their stuff, until I asked for a Patron shot to be chilled and he said the Patron wasn't on ice. Oh. Really? Hey, barkeep, how's about using that metal drink shaker behind you? Brilliant. Thanks Larry. The video screens were a bit snowy for my tastes and sadly, being in row 35, they were needed as I couldn't see Margaret Cho everytime she pointed to her vagina. Which was frequently. Acoustics were great as I heard her sniffle at least a couple of times. I didn't enjoy that, mind you, but I kept thinking, \""hey, the acoustics are really great\"". I did the pre pay parking thing for $14 but arrived early enough that it wasn't necessary. But, hey, I spent an extra $4 and got to say to the attendent, \""I prepaid online, here's my coupon\"". Lame. I know. It's the little things people! I'm prime for my next Dodge experience, but will try to secure tickets closer to the stage."
0,"We used to love this place.  But everything has changed  - except the decor.  Tonight my wife tried the Kalua Pig sandwich.  What arrived was pork jerky on a toasted bun.  The menu said it came with pineapple, but it was a 60 degree wedge, about 1/4 inch thick.  They forgot to bring the fries she also ordered, but sent for them immediately - before she tasted the pork.  When the fries came, she sent the pork back.  They apologetically asked if there was something else they could bring her. She wanted a Chinese Chicken salad we used to order, but it was removed from the menu 2 weeks ago, so she settled for the Chicken Caesar.  It was not bad.  I ordered the special - a roast beef on ciabatta, but the ciabatta was over-toasted rye instead.  We informed them that their recent changes were not an improvement, and we wouldn't be back.  They offered to take 15% off the check, and it took 3 attempts for them to finally get it right.  Unbelievable!  I had to wonder just how bad they wanted my yelp comment to be."
3,"Omg pad kee mau is great here. Affordable, small but plenty of seats. The server may have forgotten I existed but nothing was late or wrong. There was just no fawning. For the price and quality of the food, who cares?\n\nXLNT"
0,"Awful food. The beer selection was local, interesting craft stuff. My meal was clearly mostly prepped by a robot or possible undocumented immigrant in California, as it was machine perfect square sliced and aged to sourness. Bitter, sour salad, dry machine cut chicken on my flatbread.\n\nGo for the selection of half a dozen craft beer, but be prepared to wait for service. And for the love of god, eat elsewhere."
3,"The hamburger. Oh, you poor, misunderstood sandwich. So many people treat you like a fall-back. When people say, \""Eh... you just want to grab a burger?\"" it causes tears in my eyes, and great gnashing of teeth. And I can only handle so much gnashing.\n\nHowever, there is a place out there, a place that adores and cherishes you, you faithful friend, you. Holstein's, located in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, is a gourmet burger joint that mixes classic with funky. That's pretty obvious when you sit in their leather-adorned lounge area complete with a pink-and-white cow. (By the way, we've named her \""Holly Holstein.\"" Run with it.)\n\nThe burgers did not disappoint. My friend had a \""Hen House,\"" a classic hamburger topped off with a fried egg. Never had egg on your burger? You'd be surprised. I had the Longhorn burger, a BBQ burger topped with brisket. Fantastic. No stale burgers here; each bite was succulent, as if a little miniature chef was on our table crafting every bite just at the time we ate it.\n\nHolstein's has about 34 million beers on tap. OK, maybe not 34 million, but a lot. We didn't have any alcohol, as it was only noon and neither of us were in the mood to drink yet. (In Vegas? NO! Yes, you have to detox SOMETIME.) That would be my only complaint about the place, they really try hard to force the alcohol on you. We were asked about six different times if we wanted a drink or if we had looked over the bar menu. The first three times we said no should have been an indication; by the sixth time I wanted to say \""Yeah, if you're comping it.\""\n\nI've heard the shakes are killer; it's definitely on my to-do list next time I come. And there will be a next time. Oh Holstein's... shut up. Just shut up... you had me at \""hamburger.\""\n\n(By the way, when you go, find the painting of the robot in the lounge, and tell me he's not being a little obscene. Just saying.)\n\nPS: Full disclosure here: I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where Holstein's is located. However, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, I have been honest in this review. I am also not affiliated with the F&B department."
3,"I had an opportunity to stay at this fine establishment this week and I was very impressed considering this is a Holiday Inn. I generally stay away from the standard lower budget business hotels after more than a few bad experiences. I was however very impressed by this location.\n\nIt appears that the owners had recently gut out an older hotel and remodeled the entire place. The end result is modern, clean, comfortable and quite appealing to the eye. I ate in the breakfast cafe three mornings and the service was wonderful, friendly and prompt. The neighborhood is quiet and you are convenient to everything and anything. Scottsdale is just down the road 5 minutes and there is easy access to the expressways. \n\nEach room is an actual suite with a separate bedroom area, refrigerator, microwave and small bar sink. Two TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. large closet and plenty of drawers for clothes. There is a large desk if you need to work and a pullout sofa for extra sleeping. \n\nAs I was working in the gazebo one morning on my laptop I thought what a wonderful stay cation spot this would be if I lived in the Phoenix area. The price is right and if you stay in the courtyard you wouldn't guess for a minute that you were in Phoenix. There is also a lovely full bar in the lobby and a restaurant as well. So grab a bottle of wine and some microwave popcorn and settle in. This is the place to stay!"
1,Okay not really want I excepted lady didn't really do a good job on my nails kind of disappointing ........ And I felt weird there was a white lady who was going to do my nails at first so sweet and so kind and the owner just yelled at her and she ended up washing all the pedi machines after they were done using it she looked like she was gona cry but she was still so nice to guest if the owner gave her a chance she probably would be waaaaaay better then my lady kinda of wished it was her who did my nails then who I had so wasn't really good. But I didn't like how they make sure there guest are happy we'll the ones who speak English there was a young girl who helped me out and the owner very nice . But I would never ever come back here too my good nail salons to settle here .
1,"I wish I had read the reviews on \""Yelp\"" before I contacted them! First of all, in no way I want to discourage anyone from adopting through this organization because they are still doing a wonderful thing!!! I haven't actually even talked to any of the volunteers there but even my limited experience left an unpleasant taste in my mouth and a feeling like I've wasted my time. So, my husband and I decided to adopt the 4th cat for our 1 y.o. recently adopted kitty as a playmate so she would leave the other two older cats alone. We were looking for a very particular type of cat (both looks and personality-wise) and somehow I found their website and one kitten there looked and sounded like an absolutely perfect fit, another one was close. That same night I filled out the application on their website which took over an hour, actually closer to 2, sent it off and then waited 3 long days for a promised phone call. As you may guess, nobody ever called. I did send them an e-mail the next day after I'd sent the application, letting them know about my application and 2 kittens we were interested in. No reply. My husband called them and left a message. I was so puzzled. My thinking was: \""Their goal is to find a good permanent home for a pet, so the sooner they get someone adopted out, the sooner they can go and save another life from the e-list, so it only makes sense that they will try and get in touch with potential adopters sooner\"". On the 3d day, I sent them another e-mail asking if they ever received my application and inquiring whether that kitten was still available or not (the other one had already been adopted and they posted it on facebook). They did respond to my e-mail promptly that time saying they didn't have a record of my application and that the kitty had already been adopted, they also suggested filling out the application (again?). My problem with them is not that we didn't get the kitten (there are way too many unwanted cats looking for love and permanent homes, we knew we would very soon find the one we were looking for) but poorly designed website and poor communication. Maybe it was just my experience and maybe there was a glitch on the website, but after I sent the application I never got any confirmation e-mail like some other organizations send which left me wondering if it ever made it there. After reading some other reviews it's apparent that  there's a problem with it and even sounds like they know about it but it hasn't been fixed yet. There was no response after my first e-mail. The phone call was never returned. And then I turned to \""Yelp\"" and unfortunately I saw a few negative reviews with even worse experiences... We had other options, I mean other cats we could have gone to look at  but we didn't want to create any confusion and give hope to anyone else, so we were waiting for them just to let us know whether that one was still available. It takes maybe 1 minute to write \""no, he's been adopted\"". Maybe I've been kind of spoiled by my experience with a few other organizations where people would always reply promptly to any e-mail and were always there to help you find your new family member and they are volunteers as well (as an example, I had very pleasant experiences with \""Lost our home\"" foundation and \""All about animals rescue\"").\nWhat would have I done differently if  I had read the reviews here first? Well, we wouldn't have got our hopes up when we saw that particular kitty. I would have E-MAILED them a copy of my application, just to make sure it got there or, maybe even, instead of spending 2 hours on the application that may never get there, I would have only e-mailed them and called to find out about the availability of the kitten. I would have called them every day leaving a message. I wouldn't have spent 3 days anxiously waiting to hear from them. But knowing my husband, after reading the negative reviews, he wouldn't have wanted to deal with them. I do love the idea behind their work, I do think it's extremely important to make sure that you adopt animals into a loving suitable home where they will stay forever, but sounds like they at times get carried away with it. In retrospect, I'm very glad we didn't get involved with them. We ended up adopting our little girl through \""HALO\"" and couldn't be happier!  So, if you do decide to adopt from them, just keep in mind that you may not get the animal you have your heart set on. I do hope that your experience with them will be a positive one though, and  you'll be left wondering if I was writing about the same organization."
3,Mystic Paper is a very cute paper arts store in downtown Mesa.  While it caters to mixed media artist with its array of found objects and distressed papers it also offers ideas to create scrapbooks with a vintage feel.\n\nWeather you are new to paper arts or an old pro I would recommend checking out the classes at Mystic Paper.  While you can view them on their web site nothing compares to seeing and touching them in person.  This store is definitely worth a visit!
3,"We entered hungry as a group of 5 after a long day of exploring around the vast place, which is Las Vegas... We exited as rolly polly balls probably since it felt like we needed someone to roll us out of the joint.  \n\nProbably one of the best $30 investments I made for all you can eat sushi. No arguments there. \n\nWait time can be horrendous and it seems to get packed super fast. Luckily enough for our group of 5, we had no wait! \n\nThere seems to be a limit on certain things you can order. The expensive ones like the ebi/shrimp and uni (I believe) all falls under this cap. Ebi was delish, don't forget to try. And to say I'm not usually an ebi getter!\n\nUnagi for days (was a bit boney), but the flavor was there, and the spicy ahi/tuna hand rolls (note, it being spicy, I needed a couple of water refills), and raw fish up the ying yang. We ate anything and everything,  including fried shrimp heads (do not fear the shrimp heads, they're actually not that bad even though you're eating a face).\n\nSo though I'm raving why only 4 stars? Because I'm a major dessert fan, the tempura/fried ice cream and green tea ice cream did not do it for me. The ice cream in the tempura batter really didn't taste like vanilla ice cream, it kind of had the consistency of sherbert. Also, the tempura batter was soggy and not crunchy like when you think of typical fried ice cream. The green tea ice cream came to us half melted,  resulting in a puddle of frothy melted ice cream. That made me sad.\n\nThen again, you really don't come to an all you can eat sushi for their desserts. Sushi... Goyemon aced it!"
3,"This is a great store for people who enjoy living a hippie or gypsy life.  Lots of incense, eclectic jewelry, leather journals, and tie dye.  The prices range from reasonable to \""you've got to be joking\"" and everything in between.  \n\nWhen you first enter you're greeted by a small room full of jewelry, the employees, and a heavenly aroma.  The next two rooms hold clothing, knick knacks, and accessories.  The racks hold mostly the same clothing design in different colors.   I go mainly for the jewelry.\n\nTwo problems:  the employees will follow you around like you're going to steal something and I'm crossed on this.  On one hand I understand they lose a lot of inventory due to shoplifting but on another hand it doesn't make one feel welcome.  \n\nSecond problem is the store hours.  They open later than the other stores on the street which means if you like to go there right after rush hour traffic died down you still have to wait another hour for them to open.\n\nI do love this store and hope they stay in business a long time.  Try it you might like it."
2,I love the warm reception I receive when ever I come to this nail salon. The ladies are super friendly and they do a nice massage with my very well done pedicure.  my only complaint would be that they need they more color polishes to choose from.Desert Nails is. convenient and a bit of a hidden gem in the Summerlin area.
0,Part of the reason I go to a fast food drive-thru is because it's supposed to be fast. There were 4-5 cars ahead of me. It took us 25-30 minutes to get our food. We couldn't escape because we were trapped with other cars behind us. The wait is unacceptable for fast food standards. The food was alright but I'd rather go somewhere else where it's fast.
2,"I would do 2.5 stars if I could make it that way. \n\nSo lets start off with the good. Taste of the food? Pretty good. Very similar to most Japanese restaurant's curry. Whatever is fried stayed crispy. Nothing bad, but nothing extraordinary either. \n\nService was good.\n\nI felt like their prices were a little high considering their portion sizes. Everyone knows that everything in Hawaii is more expensive than the mainland. However, I could get the same curry plate that's double the portion, still for cheaper than kaba curry. Simple things like just adding a little more rice or more curry sauce would just \""make\"" the plate look fuller and make customers feel like they're getting a great deal. Rice and sauce are the most inexpensive things in a restaurant so I don't feel like people need to be stingy with those. Just a little comparison: at ichiza their beef curry is around $8 (loaded with beef, vegetables, and rice) and I can never finish it all and always have some lunch for tmrw as well. Here...I paid the same price for basically just curry sauce, rice, and katsu and I cleaned the plate off and still felt hungry. \n\nThe atmosphere here can get super awkward as well! I don't wanna offend ppl into that \""cosplay\"" world but....I felt like this restaurant was a mini convention for that! Everyone in there were in bright colored wigs, dressed up like anime, or playing magic cards! It wasn't even Halloween! We were the only \""normal\"" customers there. It was just awkward! And it seems like they're the friends of the owners too cuz they even go behind the counter freely. I felt like I was in another world and I just wanted to finish my food and leave. I mean, if you're into those kinda things or you don't mind that the place is packed with cosplay ppl then sure maybe you'll like the atmosphere. But it wasn't for me. \n\nI'll stick to ichiza. More food for the buck and I don't feel like I'm in another world there."
2,"It is cold in there. Let me repeat, it is COLD in there! Everything in there is made of ice, therefore it must be damn cold to keep it from melting. Don't roll on up in there in a bikini and shorts fresh from the pool. don't show up in a mini skirt and heels. You will be cold even with the parka they give you and the uggs you have to wear. \n\nIts pretty pricy to say the least. but its an experience. How many people do you know have gone to an ice bar where everything is made of ice? my friend called it the fortress of solitude. yeah totally geeked out there. Had to bring him back to reality, you are NOT superman. deal with it.\n\nDrinks were pretty good. with the cover you pay, that includes a jacket you get a drink. you can always order more. the glasses are made of ice. They have sculptures made of ice, and you can take a shot out a female form, yes right out of the boobies! \n\nYou can't bring anything in there with you, electronic that is, as it may not work. actually they just want to jack it up so you have to pay for pictures they take of you in there. alright, alright, i guess they have to make money considering how much their electric bill must be.\n\nGood drinks, pictures and freezing your arse off. No time limit, though mostly ppl leave before an hour due to the cold. \n\nThere's a VIP package where you can wear fur coats and get a free hat. The hat is cute and I bought it separately. parka was just as warm, took a few pics, had a few drinks and it was all good. \n\nThis is the only location in the US, rather north america. So when you get the chance, check them out.  but be ready to drop $$"
4,"During our recent visit to Vegas we tried to get tickets same day for the show and were lucky... We had seen him in NYC years ago and loved him then. He is better than ever, a must see. Great family entertainment. He is even on the cutting edge with the use of social media. Again awesome!"
0,I was going to go there for lunch but could not force myself to go in after reading all the rules the have in place for the after eight crowd. No excessive jewelry no solid colors no tank tops and the list goes on. When do Toby become become such a controlling Libtard. Almost felt like the Feds were running it. Can't patronize places like that.
1,"I checked this out like a week into my stay here to meet up with some co workers and saw that they had just enough seats for them (8 people) and none for everyone else. So that is a big boo for Heart Bar, the lack of seating. The drinks are small, but good, but overall I wouldn't mind waiting to go upstairs to their other club if the time was right, because the Heart bar is ok. \n\nLets say if you're meeting someone there for a drink, just two people, then yes go there, but if you have a group of 4 or more, check out the Venetian or Bellagio for a more spacious bar experience.\n\nenjoy."
3,"My friend and I had a blast at this place!  They provide plastic cups for your wine, apron, canvas, paint, instruction - everything but vino, snacks, and your genius!  \n\nThe instructor/owner, Anthony, was friendly and effective - his instructions helped every single person produce something that looked similar to the goal.  The paints were plentiful, mistakes were easily remedied and the whole process felt a bit adventurous to me (I was unititiated).  The finished product was better than I expected.  \n\nThe atmosphere was fun and laid back.  Check out their photos if you'd like to see the layout, but it's basically some long folding tables with a canvas and chair for each person  On each side, you have a friend you brought or a new friend you just met - tons of fun to look over and see the differences in your styles.  In short, we had lots of fun!\n\nWHAT TO DO:\nCheck out the website.  Each class, you all paint one specific thing together - the website has a calendar where you can look at a sample of what you'll be working on, so you can pick something that inspires you.  \n\nBYO wine and snacks (the snack offerings are pretty sparse).  Make sure you have plenty for several hours.\n\nNOTE: It's super spendy at regular price, but there are frequently Groupons and the like available (and those sites are searchable - just go search for Brush Party to see if they have one running)."
0,"Giligin's is somewhat of a deceptive-looking establishment located in a part of Scottsdale that so many bars or restaurants would kill to be.\n\nThe place is done up with an abundance of island/nautical themes and leads one to believe it's some kind of clam and oyster bar. It's also tried posing as a sports bar. \n\nTruth is Giligin's does serve seafood but I wouldn't recommend getting it. Even standard pub grub like wings, motz sticks and other fried apps were mediocre. \n\nGiligin's tried to tap in on the college football crowds some years back and they adopted us to have our game watch parties there. \nTheir tvs were of poor quality, like circa 1990s and many times they left up the sex games that bar patrons played the night before.\n\nThey had some kind of spin the wheel game with a lubricant in one slot and condoms in another. Sounds like fun stuff but on Saturday morning when people come in to watch their alma-maters play and bring their family, it's out of place and tacky. \n\nOne Saturday morning they locked the doors and didn't let patrons in (yes there were people inside). No announcement, no note on door, nothing. \n\nI have stopped there at night before but I remember it being uneventful and leaving. It was basically just a stop in while heading from one place to another.\n\nIt seems like it's the kind of place that lives on walker-by traffic. Why else would one go?"
3,"I am a fan of diners.  I am originally from New York, and there's a diner on every block.  Here in Vegas, it's really hard to find them.  The ones that we have found, have been extremely crowded and ridiculous.\n\n50's diner is awesome.  It is our favorite spot to go on Saturday/Sunday afternoons.  The owners are a young couple who also wait tables/cook there.  They are so attentive and friendly, and that's what makes us come back! \n\nThey have GREAT prices, and it's not some big corporate, cookie-cutter place.  They treat you like you're somebody, and that's a lot to look for in such a commercial town.\n\nTheir omelets are really good.  If you like pancakes, get theirs!  They have a really nice vanilla taste! Also, try their spuds!"
1,"Let me start by saying, I have the wellness plan with Banfield and I absolutely LOVE our home location in California. I am traveling back to Arizona to visit family and my puppy needed his medication and to finally get his rabies shot. \n\nHe has had worms in the past but that was 2 months ago and he has not been receiving any more medication for it. Before I know what's going on the nurse gave him a de-wormer, she checked his temp and then just shoved something up his rectum without asking or explaining. She did not lubricate it and my puppy screamed. I was so angry. \n\nMy puppy has a history of allergies and since we were afraid he would react to his rabies vaccination, they gave him a shot of Benadryl. While waiting for the shot to kick in, I could clearly see that there was an animal being operated on in an open room with tons of people walking around. Definitely not a sterile environment and I would not recommend bringing a pet here for surgery. \n\nIt also seemed like they were trying to pressure me into scheduling his neuter procedure for this location and I didn't like that. I do plan on neutering him, I just want to do it when I want to and when I can afford it. \n\nLike I said, I adore Banfield and how they work but I won't be bringing my puppy back to this location. We will stick with his normal location back in California. I will make sure my puppy goes to the vet before traveling."
3,"I came here for the sports book-obviously, but I ended up enjoying the chic sports bar food way more than I expected. I had my own suite and could watch any game I wanted which was great. Unfortunately, I was betting on baseball games during the hockey playoffs and had a lot of trouble getting service despite my private area and advance reservation. I had to go to the hostess station 5 times to get service and order my food. For the price, I expected better service.  I would absolutely recommend going to this sports book if you are looking to bet and don't go during the hockey playoffs lol."
1,"This restaurant seemed perfect online but when I went there  it was totally different experience. \nAs soon as stepped a foot in the restaurant I was in the face with bad smell which was combination of old frid fosh and burnt oil. This smell will stick to you for four to five  hours at least.\nThe corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant. \nI ordered chicken wings which was cold and \""rubbery\"".\nMy friend ordered po-boy chicken  tenders tge bread was old and hard consequendly  he couldn't eat his sandwich."
1,"I first stayed here 20 years ago and I thought the room was incredible...that was 20 years ago. \n\nWhen I checked in here the woman at the front desk encouraged me to pay 20 bucks to upgrade my room to the newly remodeled tower. I was not going to do it but she then said, \""Everyone in your group did the upgrade and you want to be near them!\"" Nothing like a little peer pressure at the front desk. So I took the upgrade. \n\nI could not believe that my room had been recently remodeled...it still seemed old. I probably got suckered into the upgrade so the hotel could make more money. The room is very big...there was also a powder room and a large bathroom. I could have probably lived in the bathroom, if I wanted too. I really did not need the powder room but if my wife was with me she would have definitely enjoyed this. \n\nMy iron was complete broken...it looked like someone cracked the metal and the water was leaking out of it. I called down to housekeeping and received a brand new iron...that made me feel special. \n\nAlso someone Australian Guy left his money, air travel documents and passport in my safe. The hotel had to send up two security guards to remove the items...it felt like one of those movies where I get whacked because I knew too much...I called my co-worker when they arrived and told them if they lost contact with me to run for there life and call the police. \n\nThere are so many hotels in Vegas...I would only stay here in the future if I had to stay with my group or if the rooms were free."
2,"grwat selection of goods! clothing,jewelry,sunglasses...things normally not available at Macys,but the store is run by some of the biggest jerks!maybe thats management in general. woukld hurt to crack a smile or be curteous for one second, would it?"
0,They did a really mean thing today: The musician scheduled to come in and set up was told--while setting up--that they would not have the money to pay him tonight!  He was just in to confirm last night.  That was really a mean and nasty thing to do to someone. CALL THEM AT LEAST A DAY A HEAD OF TIME STUPID!!  These people are disreputable!!!   \n\nNow they are CLOSED!    Figured as much.
4,"I tried this place for the first time today. I heard about it from a flyer left on my car. I had always gone to spring moutain to get really good Pho, but I was excited to see this place on our side of town. I tried a couple of items, the shrimp rolls in rice paper were wonderful and fresh and I loved the peanut sauce. There was also a selection of different types of non-alcoholic drinks meant to referesh the palate. I tried the ginger iced tea lemonade and it was wonderful I had never had anything like it and can't wait to have it again. I had the special PHO with the satay and it was yummy, a nice spice but not too spicy. The prices were very reasonable and everything was fresh. I can't wait to go back and try the other items."
0,"I've never been a big fan of outback, but it's one of my husbands favorites. Usually they're not bad and I do love the bloomin' onions. This particular location is just horrible though. \n\nThe steak is always fatty and almost inedible. Their chicken is way too spicy (usually very nicely flavored at other locations) and the bloomin' onions seems smaller than usual. We went a couple nights ago simply because we were shopping in the area. They actually served us Clam Chowder that was so thick I was able to push it into a little hill in the middle of my bowl and stick my fork in it ( I was bored! lol) pretty disgusting. I also had to cut apart the potatoes they put in it because they were each about a quarter of a potato. I just can't believe they let something like that out of the kitchen!\n\nThe only good thing about this location was our waitress, Betsy, she was very nice, helpful and kept our drinks full. \n\nIf you're going to go to outback, avoid this location. There are 2 that aren't that far from this one."
0,"First I have to say this review should have been posted ages ago but I forgot, so I am apologizing to anyone who may have stayed there since.\n\nNice looking hotel but after experience while meeting friends there Sunday 4/7/2013would never stay there.\n\nAfter our meeting, immediately before leaving i went to the men's restroom and as I was entering, heard a toilet flush and an employee came out of the stall then exited without even a glance at the sinks, much less stop to wash his hands or even read the sign on the door instructing him to do so. The thought that someone who may have just wiped his ass might be preparing food or handling other items used by guests grossed me out. I reported the incident to the front desk and advised that he was not carrying any cleaning  materials. \n\nThis location will never earn my confidence"
1,"It's quite appropriate that something in Las Vegas would choose to host a $9 million habitat for lions. Even more appropriate that it's in that one resort with a logo of a gold lion. Sure, it would attract spectators who might potentially spend time in the casino and other attractions at the MGM. Except, there are people who've been to the MGM a great deal of times and yet never felt inclined to visit the Lion Habitat. (Me?)\n\nIt seems I'm one of the few that was unimpressed by this extraordinary display of wealth & kitschy attempt at grandeur. When I last went in January, however, I was with a friend who hadn't been to Vegas for 15 years and stopped as we passed it on our way to the Rainforest Cafe. We saw one very bored looking lioness. Awesome.\n\nIf I really wanted to see lions, I'd go back to one the few wildlife habitats located around the world, especially those I've visited a number of times as a kid: the conveniently located Taman Safari in Indonesia, the Night Safari in Singapore, or the Wild Animal Park in San Diego."
4,"I've been going to Dave Jr. for a few years (on and off). I just saw him this past Saturday (09/13/14) and I am never disappointed in his work! The first time I ever went to him about 4 years or so ago, I didn't even know what I wanted to do, so I just let him work his magic, and that he did! He gave me the cut & style I'd been wanting for years but just was never able to explain it! Well, this time around, I had let my cousin (who was going through cosmetology school) dye my hair blonde, then after a while, I dyed it red, my roots started growing out, and the red faded to an orange-y blond throughout the rest of my hair. Needless to say, it was AWFUL. Dave Jr. not only picked the perfect color for me, but he is the only person I've gone to that takes the texture of my hair (incredibly curly) into consideration when he cuts it. His prices are fair and to me, definitely worth it! I have even taken my mom to him, and she also was incredibly happy with her results each time he's cut her hair. But, since Saturday, I have been getting compliments at work and in the street, and a few even asked where I got it done!! The other guys at the salon seem to be really great too, but I've personally only gone to Dave Jr. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great cut and style and color!"
3,"I agree with the other reviewers the service is subpar, and I sat at the bar. The beers are good, but the board(of beers on the wall) is lacking in details I want to know when doing a tasting. The restaurant also feels kind of empty. I know their going with a minimalist theme, but it's a little over the top."
3,"Gourmet food at affordable prices!  We didn't know what to expect when we went there, but was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and service.  Being a new restaurant they have some kinks to work out but as long as you have good food and service, can only get better!\n\nBetween the 3 of us we split between the new yorker, kalua pork, and tips and taters and they were all fantastic."
2,"I attended the All Baby & Child Expo here this past week.  This place is huge, although that's the best thing that it has going for it.  The place seems dated, and the bathrooms need attention.  \n\nI found the bathroom layout upstairs to be awkward, and there were no changing tables or private spaces designated for nursing.  The EXPO arranged for there to be rooms for each of these functions, but I would think that having it in/connected to the bathroom is better so moms and dads can wash their hands. I would suggest a remodel to include  family bathrooms and nursing/quiet rooms.  In any audience attending, there are bound to be parents who will need these amenities.\n\nThe food selection downstairs was awful.  The burger I had was decent, but my friends prettying hated their food from the fast food Asain/Chinese kiosk.  The only saving grace here was the Starbucks.  There also was not enough seating - with a large convention, there are bound to be people left waiting for tables while holding trays of food.\n\nAlthough I did not have to use it this trip, I like the idea that the monorail connects the convention center to the strip.  I forgot the exact price, but it's nice to have the option, especially if I return and decide to not rent a car.\n\nSo overall not bad, although there is much room for improvement.  Make plans to eat elsewhere before and after your event, and if possible skip lunch or bring something to snack on and hit a buffet for dinner!"
2,"This is one of the more run down Wine in Spirits in all of the city.  I only go to this Wine and Spirits sparingly, it's that bad.  The store is tiny and cramped and the wine selection is almost nonexistent."
0,"This company would not give me a quote for either radiant barrier or  cool wall paint  because my husband would not be there for the appointment! And then I was promptly hung up on. \nSeems a bit sexiest and old fashioned as I, a female, do all  of the hiring for projects in the home. Not to mention rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional."
2,"Eh, it was ok.  I had been really looking forward to it since I love all things bee.  It's part of a big chain so not that interesting.  The food was acceptable and the beer selection was standard.  It was conveniently located near our hotel so we went there a few times.  With each visit it lost a little more charm.  I could skip it next time around."
2,Harkins is still a great place to catch amovie with the reclining chairs and digital sound and screen.  Their prices have gone up at the concession stand but you can buy discounted movie tickets at Costco and still enjoy soda refills but those are now $1.50 ( instead of $1.00 ) and the souvernior cup is $5.00 ( instead of $4.50 ) that is a $1 increase.  Harkins is better than AMC although AMC has better prices especially in the afternoons but Harkins rules when it comes to comfort.
1,"I was told by a fellow yelper that this place has fresh lamajune, so we decided to check it out, They have lots of good looking pastry and lamajune was on the menu up on the wall but when we ordered it they said they were out waste of a trip, maybe if I'm on that side of town again ill stop in and try again."
3,"What a great new buffet the Bellagio open last year 2013. This place look very fancy front the outside and on the inside. When you go inside the buffet line they have many variety station from seafood, Mexican, American, and Asian. For seafood they served crab legs, shrimps, oysters, crawfish, salmon, etc. for the other stand out station American had steak, Mexcian had tacos, and Asian had sushi, noodles, and some dim sum dishes. The desert station was so amazing that it has everything single desert you can think of from ice cream, to specialty cakes, to snow flake ice cream. I sure def made my $50 worth especially hitting up the crab legs multiple times. Make it count!"
0,"Saw a jump in my monthly bill from $38 to $63.  No notice, just surprised me with a 65% increase in my bill.  \n\n$63 for just internet service!  Nothing else, no bundle, just internet.  That is ridiculous! \n\nTried to find out why, but customer service could not tell me, that department was closed at 8:20 PM phoenix time.  So was the department that would cancel my service.  Have to wait until tomorrow morning to get it shut off.  I can not wait for verizon and Comcast to start offering service in my area.  Nothing like a little competition to keep these crooks in check.  Switching to Century link for the next year, then we'll see who gets my business."
1,"3.5 stars + 1star\n\nBeen here twice... both of em after 9pm around closing hrs...\nI was seated at the bar the first time around and the waiter did cater pleasingly. He wasn't impressed that I said enough after my first glass of wine though....\n\nThe 2nd time around though.....WOAH!!!!!\nPathetic..... there was a sense of \"" GTFO ...we are closing in an hour's time\"" lingering in the air. We were craving Italian and Romano's ranks(ranked rather) higher than Olive Garden any day on my chart. But this evening was a disaster.\nThe water we were served had floaters...eeks!... The glasses were dirty... guess the dishwasher was either not working or maybe they was some serious cost cutting\nWhats with Romano's new policy of serving water from a smudgy glass bottle....and refilling it from that cheap a$$ plastic water which stands as the center of attraction in the middle of the dining area????\nand then when I asked for house wine... guess what it is served in ? a cheap a$$ water glass(ikea?) ... is washing a goblet such a big nuissance......?? or does Romano's want 2 let you know that you are cheap to order their house wine which infact does have a fancy italian name ..lol\n\nIm just tired of writing\n\nRomano's at Tatum.... you let me down... big time!"
3,"I had the Sedona and it was great.  Service was fair, not real slow but not great either thus 4 stars."
1,Slow service. Buffalo wings were blah.  Long wait times even though it wasn't busy. Chicken tenders were really good.  Server wasn't very friendly
1,I've never been a fan of Quizno's and this location in particular isn't great. The service is always subpar. When we approach the counter I always feel like I'm bothering them. They barely utter a word of greeting and can't seem to be bothered to even crack a smile or ask if we're ready to order. On every occasion I have been here I have to start the interaction which is a little annoying. We came here recently because I'm a Groupon addict and I just can't seem to resist. I'll stick to Firehouse Subs and Subway in the area instead.
0,"Never have I walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay because of bad food. NEVER. Until now.\n\nWe were in a hurry so stupidly decided to just go for lunch in the first non-chain restaurant we found on St Denis. BIG MISTAKE. I sort of blame myself as if I had actually looked at this place more clearly I would have noticed how grimy and dirty the outside was. It was also completely empty despite there being hoardes of people in local competitors.\n\nService started out a bit weird. I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied: ''I could make you one I suppose''....Odd. Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.\n\nI went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!\n\nStupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.\n\nThe food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.\n\nWhat was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders. I think that says a lot - I got the impression we were not the first customers to have done this recently.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS. We really should have just gone into the Subway next door."
4,Love this place!  We visit Las Vegas twice a year and always include a visit to the Grand Lux. Have never had anything but an excellent meal.  I now must eat gluten-free and they accommodate me very well.
0,"I was excited to find a place close to home that was casual and decently priced. I ordered the Chicken Greek Pita, which tasted nothing like a Greek Pita. It was pretty much, chicken, tomatoes, and lettuce with some sort of a mayo sauce. I didn't even finish it and I was starving. My friend ordered a GRILLED Chicken Salad and the chicken wasn't even grilled. The bowl was so small, all of the salad kept falling out onto the bar-top. He also didn't finish his meal. It's also a pet peeve when restaurants make you pay for your sides. \n\nAll in all, I will not go here again."
4,Excellence. That is all.
4,"Dr. Wood is constantly learning new healing techniques. He has walls covered with certificates. He is licensed in rehab and before attending chiropractic school, he assisted a physical therapist. He is a wonderful wholistic doctor who cares about his patients and doesn't mind working hard to bring them relief. So glad I found him."
4,Couldn't have asked for anything better. Great for golfers and non golfers alike. Wish they had something like this when i was in highschool.
3,"I stopped in for lunch to check the place out. Have driven by several times and never had the chance to sit in until today. \n\nIt was quiet due to being Monday. First impression- very clean! Also, a ton of beer taps with a very wide selection and variety. \n\nFood menu was a bit shallow. Diversity of burgers but not much else to speak of. Wasn't surprised... went there to get a burger and a beer. I got the California burger and it was super tasty! The fries left something to be desired. I've had tastier potato chips. \n\nStaff were very friendly! Will drop in again."
3,I recommend the truffle fries they were delicious. The buffalo wings were good. The staff was friendly. It was superb! Everything is always delicious and the staff was very attentive.
4,"Though expensive at \u00a316, this is seriously, as good as it gets!\n\nMost of the time, I don't like doing tours, though this is a must-see for anyone going to Scotland, or Edinburgh, for the first time. \n\nYes, you get the crowds, though I'm here in the winter, so they're not as bad as I've seen in the photos.\n\nThe hook-line-sinker for me for doing this one is the fact that - \n1. It's a CASTLE, and\n2. It sits on a HILL.\n\nSince I love architecture and do photographs, I wanted some of the best vantage points that I could have of the city (and of the castle).\n\nThe only thing about being here in the winter is that you don't necessarily get the \""plays on light\"" against the subject (castle) that you might get in the summertime.\n\nThe other thing that I also liked is that - \n1. Most of it is outdoors, and\n2. It wasn't guided (audio is an option), and I could just roam around freely.\n\nThe funny but eery coincidence is as I was as I had walked into the cellar/dungeon underneath the Half Moon Battery where David's Tower once was, where the Crown Jewels were once hidden/buried, I was reading something about the number of soldiers that had died under siege there. The air got heavy; I felt my heart rate change; and suddenly, some really cool breeze swept over me. \n\nAs I was beginning to take a turn and walk further into the cellar, the lone light bulb in there went out - as did the electricity for the rest of the castle and half of the Royal Mile.\n\nThe Scottish National War Memorial, commemorating soldiers who had died in both of the world wars, was extra-moving after the electricity had gone out. It was my favorite thing there, and extremely moving with the stunning architecture and stained glass. It really prompts you to be silent in there, and with due respect."
0,"Does not worth the price, I ordered a raviolis  entree and they were undercooked with hard edges, the porc filet mignon was ok (nothing remarkable)\n\nSome friends ordered a tomato starter and  was awful, fully stuffed with pure mayonaisse, they didn't even finished it.\n\nThe service was ok until we asked for the bills.\n\nWe were a group of 20 and they decided to charge the 10% service before taxes in our bills."
2,Server failed to tell us it was happy hour. Food is pretty good. The place was very loud.
1,"I've always been a fan of the Dilly Bird, it's just a delicious sandwich... I can't speak for all locations but the one in Mesa off of Southern was a real disappointment the other night.  I waited almost 30 minutes for a cold turkey sandwich!  After working all day and sitting in traffic for an hour the last thing I want to do is sit in a fast food joint for that long, especially when all the \""kids\"" behind the counter are messing around talking about their homework and girlfriends or boyfriends and not working.  I have been going to this location for a dilly bird for longer than I can remember, but unfortunately I will not be returning any time soon unless someone can guarantee I wont have to sit and listen to teenagers for a half hour while I wait for a cold sandwich."
0,"Wow. Sad and dismal letdown both in food and in service.\nI was on a hop out to LA and had a bit of time to kill.\nFood was a great idea as the stomach was empty and my reserve light was on. That could only mean i had a one hr max to find fuel or shut the engine down.\nEnter... the 12th fairway. Wow... it looked good from the outside.\nHad a golf feel to it. Sure, why not... thought the man who was desperate.\n\nWell, I should have focused on the NOT and I do heavily emphasize the WHY!\n\nThe sandwich was dismal and service even worse. Never have i had a burger that limp, downtrodden or beaten up. The onion rings were more like overcooked batter. \n\nNext time, i'm shutting down the motor faced with the same choice of hunger pangs or 12th fairway. Now i know why they invented Snickers."
4,"This is by far the best tailor I've ever been to! And I've lived all over the world. They pay such attention to detail, do an incredible job, and their price is the best in town. I've come to them several times and I will continue to come back time and time again. Thanks"
1,"Health nuts (and those looking for lighter fare) will love that the food is free of heavy seasonings. But the portions are tiny and, my God, is the service here slow and rude. Perhaps that's why Sushi San, despite occupying one of the most visible spots in the food court, attracts hardly any customers even during peak hours. Once I asked for rice and vegetables in separate containers (as opposed to one on top of the other in a cramped bowl, making it impossible to enjoy the two together). The server flatout refused without even a trivial apology."
3,"When at Wynn make sure you take the opportunity to have a drink here. First of all the ladies are just sweet. So with plenty of eye candy all around you know you will be fine. \n\nYou can sit inside or out but the patio is the place to be seen. They have a water show but that's not the draw for me. I love this place because it is one of the only place that you can get absinthe served in the old traditional style. \n\nPrices can be steep, cocktails are about $12, but you can get a nice bottle of white for under $40. Sit back and enjoy."
1,"The place is nice for a smaller club. I went on a Friday and it wasn't that crowded. No one was dancing. We gave our music request and once they started playing our music, we started to dance and I guess that got the party started because others started to dance as well. It's a nice sized dance floor, but the drinks suck. I was looking to get a good AMF but instead it was more mixer than alcohol. Way tooo sweet. To add to this dismay, I was charged $18 for this single drink! WTF?! I felt violated. Don't pay to get in! They give free passes so walk around the casino and find a guy giving passes."
0,"Out of all the Walmarts I've been too I hate this one the most  and it is mismanaged from the top-down. It's always the same thing. They consistently fill in the gaps with over stocked items. It reeks of desperation of trying to unload un-wanted inventory on me. Basically, trying to get me to buy what they want, and not what I want.  Its no way to run a store. What's even worse  through the check out they ask if you found everything okay. Like a fool I waste my time explaining to them what they we're out of .They either have no reply or just the half-hearted sorry.  There are far better run Walmart's then this one that do keep correct inventory and have employees that actually care. Stay away if you can"
0,"I have been to many Waffle Houses before, but this one is gross. I had to get up and leave due to general lack of cleanliness. We sat down at a \""just cleaned\"" table which still had a big smudge of syrup or jam on it, then we grabbed our menus which also had finger-smudged gunk all over them. I ordered an ice tea and the aftertaste of it was gross... it had been over-brewed. It was incredibly cold in there as well, which was totally unnecessary considering the temperature outside was in the 70's. Yet they had the AC on full blast and I was uncomfortably chilly. The final straw for me was when I saw a small group of flies buzzing around next to the window near my table... at first I didn't think anything of it; I thought they were outside the window. But then I noticed they were all actually inside, and if I can see that many flies right at my table, there must be quite a few roaming freely inside the restaurant. Overall lack of cleanliness made us get up and leave. I shall not come back to this particular Waffle House."
0,I would actually love to give this place no stars but obviously I can't. I stayed at this hotel one time and that's all that did it for me. This hotel is randomly stupid. The slots are like whatever too. I stayed there for 3 nights. The first night I barely was in the room. The second night is where everything went down. I slept in the bed and woke up covered in blotches all over my body. They itched like crazy and I was finding myself looking for a CVS and trying to get rid of it rather than sitting by the pool having a good time. I later found out the hotel has a bed bug problem. My suitcase was on the bed half the time so I just threw the whole thing out including my clothes. I rushed to a doctor out here by my house and they said they go away on their own. I spent almost a month being tormented by it.
1,Move b@%ch GET OUT THE WAY GET OUT THE WAY\n\nA girl needs room to dance. My advice to Tao.... a little less women in tubs and more dancing space for those of us who can't afford the velvet rope treatment. And a wait of 1.5 hrs to get in and pay 20 bucks..... Thank God I live in san francisco!
1,"Maybe I picked a bad day, but the quality of food here has really gone down the last few years.   I arrived just before 12pm on Saturday Aug 2, and so many of the stations were still on their breakfast items of pancakes, eggs, etc.   \n\nAll the seafood fish items were really tasteless and very tough.   The pizza should not even be offered, as it looked like something out of the frozen section of a supermarket.   I didn't see any crab legs, but they did have shrimp out, which was pretty good.  \n\nI will say the desserts were great as always.   Also, service inside at my table was great, but the area where you pay looked totally confused and chaotic."
0,"Again, a sham. We were happy to have Wazoo pick up the furniture. We don't teach Judo classes. There was never a \""perfect replacement.\"" \n\nRick, the owner of Wazoo kept our money, went on 'vacation' numerous times, was hard to get a hold of and never refunded us.\n\nBottom line, we are now stuck with two pieces of crap couches made of particle board and 1x1s. Buy here ONLY if you want cheap furniture and poor customer service!"
3,Superb beer selection. Music was really nice and at a good volume. Really a great place to hang out and have a drink. We missed (aka were too tired to stay up past our bedtime) a jazz jam session. Will have to grab a coffee and hang out next time because I miss me some good jazz. It's so hard to find in Phoenix!
0,"Absolutely Horrific\nMay 16, 2009 - On a busy Friday night, we needed some food and did not want to do the waiting for a table deal at some of the nicer restaurants in the Rio Hotel and Casino. \n\nWe happend by the Rub BBQ, and we should have known better just by the horribly tacky theme chopper motorcycle in the entrance, equipped with a BBQ smoker sidecar. Even diehard rednecks would think this is as lame as it gets.\n\nOkay, we order from the terribly dog-eared and worn out menus in an atmosphere that could be best described as \"" cardboard factory lunchroom\"" decor.\n\nWe order from the menu, Baby Back ribs and the fixings.\n\nOh lord, thats when it got even worse. Poor service, wrong beverages delivered, and then came the food.\n\nThis was the absolute worst \""BBQ food\"" I have ever eaten in my life, and that includes greasy food prepared 200 miles off-shore on an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nLet's see, Baby Back ribs: Well, not any form of a rack that I could determine, as the ribs were all individually sliced and detached, in perfectly sliced (Read: cut while cold and reheated), or they just happen to posses a kitchen lazer beam that slices slow cooked pork to the thousands of an inch in straightness.\n\nBut then, I am implying slow cooked goodness, which this was not even close, as the overwheming and sickening flavor of liquid smoke was permeated into the meat and (or complete lack thereof) BBQ sauce.\n\nHey, that would be bad enough, but that would be taking for granted these were actually Baby Back ribs. They were not! They were actually the smaller lengths of the Pork Ribs they offer on their menu, and what was even more disturbing was the fact the 6-7 ribs we were served did not even match each other in cooking color, length and overall appearance. \n\nNice.....a grab bag of ribs. Leftovers? Uh huh.\n\nThen comes the sides, lets describe the eternal BBQ favorite, baked beans: We will just say they should be called \"" A whole bottle of Liquid Smoke in Bush's Baked Beans\"". Nuff said, ineatable.\n\nFrench fries, not bad, not good....lots of salt, PASS THE KETCHUP please.\n\nBBQ Sauce presented at the table?? Clearly UN MARKED as to variety, spices, etc. The silk screening was work off the platic bottles, from what I hope was hot water cleaning. I think I overestimate the cleaning part of the equasion. Thats okay, they were all near empty anyway.\n\nBut here is the kicker, (now mind you we all had 1 call or well mixed adult beverage with dinner) THE BILL.$80.00. \n\nYep, EIGHTY DOLLARS for complete shit, and I do mean SHIT. \n\nNice thing though, the next day I got to revisit the experience in my bathroom, as it seems RUB BBQ does not know very much about clean and fresh food products or food handling. Thank god for extra soft Charmin.\n\nThe waitress was okay, just barely. We tipped the normal 20% that DECENT HUMANS give as a gratuity, but they actually all deserved to be kicked suare in the nuts for placing that rubbish in front of paying customers.\n\nI'm sure the owner of this dump lives in Maryland or New York City, a real hotbed of smoked BBQ food activity, and he or she swings by the Las Vegas store on the way to the VIP suite on the 50th floor of the Rio Hotel, just spending enough time on premises to pat everyone on the back and say \""Good Job!!!\"".If you value a healthy gastrointestinal tract and actual good food value, NEVER eat at \""Rub BBQ\"". \n\n(I cut and paste from another site, before I noted that YES, this dump is actually based in NY City. Go figure, called that one correctly. What a joke.)"
3,"Zuri holds a special place in my heart. One, they make *the best* mojito ever. That's right: a mojito. The less-informed might claim it's a girl drink. Little do they know that most of the world was introduced to it when James Bond himself took a sip of one in Die Another Day. That's enough of a man-card for me. They literally build it up from scratch, fresh, everyday. It's delicious. Don't go here without trying at least one. \n\nWhen I was in town last year to see Dave Matthews Band, a lot of time was spent at this bar. Flava Flav was even there at the same time we were. It's a dynamic space that still has a separated area from the bar so you can chill in comfort without being bumped into by patrons. Bonnie and I had a nice stop there on our trip. It just seems like it's in the perfect spot in the casino. It's got a certain something that I really can't put words on. Nice place."
1,This place was just ok. The salsa bar was pretty decent.
4,"Very Peaceful area to camp. My family has enjoyed time here every year for the last 5 years. The water looks beautiful from the west campground. The sites have gorgeous views of the mountains, boats, and wilderness."
2,"It's good, but not great. Definitely not a cheap meal, if you splurge and order a tea or soft drink, you are looking at $12 for lunch. \n\nThe hibachi is popular, I didn't see many lining up for sushi. The buffet is a different story. I like the way the tables are laid out, even when they are crowded, there is enough room to walk around the tables. \n\nSo what's good? If you like chicken, the fajita is really good. The fried wings are good too, the drumettes are meaty and tasty. The s&p calamari is good if you get them fresh from the kitchen. I don't eat rice, but they have several to choose from. The selection on the weekend was different than what I saw on a weekday, and the meal was $2 more on Saturday. Otherwise, looked like the standard Chinese buffet offerings. If you can pack the food away (not in a doggy bag lol), probably a good choice if you are in the University area."
2,This is for the casino only. I cannot vouch for anything else. \n\nThey were very tolerant of my friends and I at 5am. They still served us alcohol and the $5 i spent  on penny slots (which i was loudly renaming penny sluts. It was 5am people) lasted for what seemed a long while. \n\nI will come back the next time I am stumbling drunk at 5am in downtown Las Vegas. Mwah!
2,"Good stuff.  The food comes out fast, and it's tasty.  You may need to apply lots of Sriracha to make some of the less popular items more palatable, but for the most part, this place has good eats."
4,"I am not that big on shows, plays or even movies, but this was some entertaining shit.  Yeah the ticket price is a little high, but every seat in the house is good.  I was hugely impressed with the stage, lighting, and accuracy of the entire show.  The music was played live also which I thought was dope.\n\nIf you get a chance to see this show go for it.  I also recommend going to Stratta to eat/drink before hand.  Its a great restaurant and its right next to the theater.  I don't hand out 5 STARS like condoms at the clinic, so you know this show is the shit."
2,"So I had the veggie burger. It was not a garden burger that you buy in the frozen aisle of a grocery store. there was a veggie patty, but they added zucchini, yellow squash, and others. They also added salsa, which i did not like. Overall, okay sandwich, okay restaurant, but I would not necessarily come back here."
4,"Being from LA, we found this place on line and tried it out this morning as I really wanted some biscuits and gravy. Luckily we got there early as the place filed up pretty quick.  I did get the Biscuits and Gravy and it was definitely 5 stars..  We were greeted by a smiling and happy waitress. Seated quickly.  As I hoped the biscuits were very very good. I would highly recommend. Did not need to add anything. Will definitely go back...."
1,"this place really disappointed me and my fiancee.. sure we came at the beginning of autumn.. but the gardens itself really left us wanting more since it was devoid of \""pretty flowers\"".. the chinese gardens with the lanterns was nice though.. nevertheless.. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone"
3,"A cute cafe-bakery, Tipsy has unique, cozy drinks and delicious sweet treats to accompany them. Most of their products appear to be concocted and assembled in-house, including the truffles, and the whole place has that modern but homemade feel that sets it apart from trendier, perhaps more shallow joints. \n\nI felt welcome from the start of my visit thanks to the incredibly patient and engaging staff, and the warmth of their happy customers. The barista was very kind and personable, and I even met a regular who has a drink named after him! Tells a lot about just how local this place is. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed their homemade chai, and the chocolate dipped strawberry that the regular mister so kindly ordered for me as I was trying to decide what to get. As commonplace as chai tea and chocolate can be, Tipsy provides a nice, distinct take on both - I can't pinpoint what it is exactly, but whatever it is, I'm glad they've taken the time to personalize their formulas to set themselves apart. \n\nI'm hoping they open a little later, eventually, maybe when people finally discover that there's a much more charming option here than the Starbucks down the street. I'll definitely be dropping in semi-regularly to see what they're stirring up next!"
0,"Just walked into the place.  Walked passed a few employees. I didn't realized they were emloyees at the time cause they were sitting in the two separate booths eating. When I walked up to the counter the lady said \""sorry mam but we are still closed\""  I said \"" oh I'm sorry the doors were open and I saw people sitting down when  I came in\"" she said they were employees.  It would had be nice to be informed that when I walked in instead of looking at me walk all the way to the counter. I thought that was part of customer service."
2,We ended our Saturday night here after dancing the night away at J-Pop Lounge just down the way. The had a live act which plays every Saturday night called Boogie Nights and it was fun. \n\nOnly downside was having to deal with the second hand smoke of the idiots near the entrance seeing as it was nearly impossible avoiding their fumes. Some people have no respect for others.
0,"This club was reccomended by people because of the hype and djs,  we got into the guest list of 14 girls. We had to wait all the way outside until you can get to the line inside the casino. It was fucking ridiculous. This was the line to get in free so you cant really complain I guess,But it gets worse once youre inside. \n\nTraffic jam everywhere!  Rude bouncers flashing lights in your face. They over compacity this place making it impossible to get any air or place to dance. And when you do find a place to take a breather, the bouncers rudely make you move the fuck out. If you cant handle all that people inside a club, then you should have maximum limit. Never again. Save your time and go to xs instead. \n\nF.y.i The layout of the club wasnt anything exciting either."
0,"Went in, middle of the afternoon. Only two tables are seated.  A cook from the back came out, saw us and went back to the kitchen. We waited to be seated for 10+ minutes and eventually left and went to Riverview IHOP. \n\nThe next day, we tried the IHOP on Apache again. It was morning and packed. Waited again for a while, no one came to seat us. Back to Riverview.\nWon't be returning."
3,"I have had almost one of everything off of their menu and have yet to be disappointed!  The staff is very very nice, and the food is great.  One of my favorites is the shredded beef torta!!!"
2,My client wanted to come here for lunch. It was 107* outside. Red Robin was nice and cool inside.\n\nI went with the fish and chips. A good portion of cod - 4 fat battered pieces and unlimited fries. I only had one serving BC there was plenty of food.\n\nOur waiter was friendly & accomadating and he checked in many times.\nIt's funny I have a Red Robin 5 minutes from my house and have eaten there only once!
4,Sushi is AMAZEBALLS. Employees are super friendly. And you even get to watch them gut your fish. You don't find many fish places like this around anymore. I rather Penn Ave Fish Co. than Wholeys!
3,I really like subway but they have to be the cheapest when it comes to their napkins BC there r 3 of us eating and they gave us one napkin. Nice.       This location is larger than the others that I have been in. Not to busy.
4,"I was getting overrun with ants every summer. I tried everything, all the poisons and homemade tricks. Nothing worked. The first time Fischer's Pest Control came out, they were very nice, unobtrusive, and were done pretty quickly. \n\nThat was a few months ago. I still do not have an ant issue. For the first time, my house is ant free during the summer. Money very well spent."
1,"This place is ok. Defiantly better than places like Subway when talking about quality, but not so much better at quantity. \n\nI have been here a few times. The first was a month or so ago after purchasing a groupon. They have a large selection of sandwiches, mostly meat and only two vegetarian options. This is great if you happen to be an omnivore. Which I am not. I can only say anything about the Madison Square Garden which I have had three times now. Their veggies seem to be of good quality. I just wish that every time I came in they were not out of wheat bread. I don't know if they just don't stock up on it or what but every time I have been in here they have been out of something. Cucumbers, wheat bread, avocado. And usually there is never any black tea. Some people like to ATTEMPT to eat healthy. There is also a lot left to be desired if you do order any of the other sandwiches on the menu. I went with my dad the last time who happens to eat meat, and there was more bread than meat. 10 dollars for a bread and cheese sandwich. Come on now. You have pictures all over the place of sandwiches full to the brim with meat and veggies, but then hand you a sandwich that you can't even see the meat on. FALSE ADVERTISING. So expect to pay a good amount of money if you order anything with meat on it, but not get your moneys worth.\n\nThe servers, if you can call them that, seem confused every time I come in here. They seem flustered, even though its the same people every time, and it has never been busy so I don't know what their excuse is. They don't seem to know the menu very well, or when something does happen to run out. They also close extremely early for a restaurant. 7 everyday except Sunday at 5. Seems strange. Maybe its because they can never keep enough food stocked to last longer than a few hours.\n\nMy conclusion: If you have a coupon or are a vegetarian where they put more veggies on your sandwich than anything else and you don't pay as much as you would for a meat sandwich, I would say go. But if you are looking for a good deal, you won't find it here."
3,"Best stinking Ruben this side of NY!  Seriously, these guys make great sandwiches.  The corn beef is never fatty and the guy said he actually spends the time to trim it before he cooks it.  It shows with how wonderful the the meat comes out.  Also, their pastrami is damn good if you are in the mood for a Rachel.  The food is spot on, big portions, and just damn good.  Give them a try!"
1,"First impression: where am I.\n\nI stepped through the door and bam - that's it. \n\nThe lighting cast a yellowy tint and illuminated the one display case that had held 2 lonely boxes of chocolates that I couldn't even tell were chocolates because the boxes were all closed up and covered...how do I know what I'm buying? :(\n\nAdded to the strangeness of my experience here the fact that nobody else was in the room. And by that I don't mean that there were no other customers; I mean that nooo one was there. No worker. I felt alone. Like an intruder in this strange chocolate world.\n\nBut THEN a woman appeared from behind an obscure curtain (Wizard of Oz-style people).\n\nShe was friendly though. No wrath of the great and powerful Oz felt here.\n\nIt's just....I had no idea how to order. I came in with the intent of buying just one little chocolate of theirs, but they don't so much cater to this. There were no display cases of delicious looking chocolates to peruse as I had been anticipating. And there were no little chocolate maps/menus..sadness. \n\nBasically what you do is tell them how maaaany chocolates you want and they'll determine which kinds you get. And they don't too readily tell you what chocolates you're getting unless you ask...weird again.\n\nNow the actual quality of the two truffles I ended up with was just fine. Decent chocolates for sure. But given the bizarre nature of the actual shop and the \""just okay-ness\"" of the truffles, I won't be rushing back."
3,"Society Cafe at the Encore serves the best burgers I have ever tasted!! After spending a couple of hours at XS my group and I decided to leave and find a place to eat. In the midst of our drunken stupor we came across this cute cafe. I was grateful that we were able to dine and be served at such a late hour in the night. \n\nTo be quite honest, I'm not quite the burger fan however I'm glad I ordered one here. I suggest ordering the Society Cafe burger, it comes with a large cup of fries. And if you're up for it, ask for it to be cooked rare. This ensures that the meat will be tender and juicy. \n\nI highly recommend Society Cafe at the Encore. :)"
2,"We enjoyed it, at there around 2 am on Sat night (Ok, Sun am) and it was pretty good!  We ordered chicken lollipops, steamed pork buns, chopped salad, BLT, omelet and shrimp pasta. Everything was from decent to delicious (shrimp-meh, but BLT OMG).  The wine list was great, good wines around 10 per glass and the mixed drinks were very good.  People watching here at this time of night is priceless!"
0,"Shorter wait.. Good food but Very Poor Costumer Service! Literally! If you guys wants to eat at HnJ Crawfish, i suggest to just go to the other location less than a mile from here! Food is the same but Customer Service is wayyyyyy different! Longer wait but worth it! This HnJ location has shorter wait but after they get your order, it will take 1 1/2 hours for it to come! Asked 3 staff but they just keep saying \""ok\""... Really?  and oh! Where's the butter? Isn't that a very simple request? Where's my water? How come we only have 3 pcs of gloves? We actually have 4 hands in total?  Goodness! We're done eating already.. Nvm!  Our vegas trip was kinda ruin because of this!"
4,"I'm so pleased GVR finally got with the program and put one of these in the food court last year! I love that while this is in a food court, it's just as good as any of their free standing locations. The Bobbie is special and one of my favorite guilty pleasures in this world. I hate stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, and turkey (in fact I hate Thanksgiving!), but somehow I love this sandwich!!"
2,"Friday night after a long workweek seemed to be a good time to treat ourselves to a new cuisine, so my friend and fellow yelper John M. and I decided to check out this Uzbek restaurant. The interior would be mostly generic in appearance were it not for the somewhat ornate Middle-Eastern curtains, and a TV screen playing Uzbek and Russian music videos added to the ambiance. Large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu. For starters, we ordered Uzbek salad - tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette - and blinchik, which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing; beware, the blinchik are rather filling by themselves. We also ordered palov and lamb kebabs. The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat, and was quite a good choice. The lamb kebabs were juicy and flavorful, though the rice that came with it was on the dry side. A small basket of warm pita bread rounded up the meal. In all, it was a good meal, not great, but definitely satisfying. And I do hope to try the soup dishes next time."
4,"I'm pretty sure this place has a different name, but I'll post here and try to search the real name later.  \n\nThis is primarily a panaderia-Bakery.  So they have the typical Mexican breads and fresh corn tortillas.  \n\nThen, they have the grill, which serves all sorts of Mexican foods including our favorites: Pozole (red/white), tamales (red/green/sweet corn), tostadas, taquitos, tacos, burritos.\n\nThey also have the freshMexican drinks and additional desserts and Mexican candies.  Plus, a little side cooler with regular american drinks and some basic Mexican necessities like avocados, cilantro, onions and Mexican canned food.\n\nRecently, probably in the last year, they've added a carniceria-meat counter.  Where they also have included cheese.  Decent prices.\n\nMost of the workers are Spanish speaking, so yes, non-Spanish speakers may have problems ordering \""special items\"" like with our without this or that type of foods...But if you just order what's on the menu, or put your grocery items or baked items in your little carrier and check out, all will be fine.\n\nThere's a lot of in and out traffic, but they have a few chairs/tables for some in-dining.  They're right on the corner of the little shopping center that they're in on the SouthEast of Thomas and 32nd Street."
3,perfect for family lunch on sabbaths! my fav.!!! :D
0,"No. No. No. No.\n\nYou couldn't drag me in here again by my hair and I am pretty sure that most of my dinning companions would agree.\n\nI ordered the day's roast (turkey) with mash, Yorkshire puddings, and vegetables. The Yorkshire puddings that Deacon Brodies served where unanimously voted the worst Yorkshire puddings ever served - this from a table of Brits! Greasy, soggy, inedible. They were left on the plate with most of the rest of the food served to me. The turkey was dry, the gravy congealed, and the vegetables bland. It may have been the worst meal I had while in Europe for two weeks (and I can say this after having eaten breakfast at Victoria Station in London - gag).\n\nThe damnation of Deacon Brodies doesn't stop with my order...\n\nTwo other members of our party ordered the Haggis with neeps and tatties . They were served the smallest portions I have ever seen in a restaurant (and I love Tapas!). No gravy. The nips weren't mashed up enough - a LARGE chunk of veg was stuck in the middle of the serving portion. Really unappetizing. It was a sad sad representation of Scotland's finest culinary offer.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back? Bad beer.\n\nTwo of the people we were with ordered a beer that they have had many times before. Both of them came to the conclusion that the beer served at Deacon's was bad. The taste was wrong and they couldn't even gag it down. When we called the server over to deal with the situation he tasted the beer and declared to the table, \""Nothing is wrong with this beer. That is the taste.\""\n\nReally? The brewery makes beer that tastes rotten and stale? Interesting concept.\n\nThey did not offer a new beer. They did not offer a different beer. They did not offer to remove the beers from the check. In fact,  no solution to the problem was ever offered other than that the beer was fine.\n\nOutstanding.\n\nDeacon Brodies, you lose."
2,"Good spot for families and kids. Avoid the snow cones, but be sure to try a sundae in the waffle bowl. The coconut ice cream was excellent. My only complaint is they have much more chocolate/caramel flavors than they do fruity flavors."
3,"Being new to this state I'm in need of a mechanic.  When my car needed brakes, I asked Wal-Mart if they did brakes to which I was suggested to check Masterwerks.  \nThey were recommended on the basis of being fair and honest mechanics.\nMy visit was a pleasure.  They were able to service me right away, and I did feel as if they were being honest and not pushing about other work the car did or may have needed.\nThey weren't the cheapest though, but not the most expensive either (as I already had two quotes to compare)."
1,"We came here on a trip to see Sir Tom Jones. The beach / pool / river area was mostly closed for construction. I would like to come back in the summer and see how this place compares to the excellent pool area at the Mirage. \n\nI didn't  care for the room. It had so many doors it made for an awkward layout . Double doors for the two closets, the bathroom, toilet and shower. They all opened up against a bed or wall or something equally  unmovable, restricting getting around if any door was open. Most doors had wood slats for the pseudo - cabana look. The towels had the consistency of sandpaper. The other room our group had seemed a bit more normal  and functional.\n\nThe hotel is a Little bit off the strip and maybe that helps, that it is quick and easy to catch a cab, even on the weekends. The line was fairly short and moved quickly.\n\nThe casino was friendly to half our group. Jeff won a $1,500 slots jackpot after swearing how stingy the Mandalay's machines were and  Robert made a few hundred every time he stepped out of the room.\n\nThe casino has a few theme attractions, one for Russian food, which I can't understand and one for 70;s disco. They also have live music in the casino bar.\n\nOn Thursday we had to swim a sea of trailer park hookers to get to the elevators to our room. They congregated at the slots near the elevator and threw themselves at any man going by. On Friday Security was out in force and the area  was clear."
1,"The service was great, everything else was severely lacking.  Ambiance - we had a late dinner reservation and there was a big family next to us with a kid who was either crawling around the floor or laying on a chair sleeping the whole time (he was over 5 years old).  Food - not even as good as my Italian cooking, which is average at best.  Plus, they brought us an antipasto tray which we did not order, and then charged us an exorbitant amount for it on the bill.  I had risotto which was cooked well but flavorless.  My boyfriend had pesto pasta which was just completely smothered in pesto, it looked like it was from a jar.  The wine selection is good, with many half bottles, but extremely overpriced.  Other restaurants at Red Rock are MUCH better."
3,"Fantastic. As a Miami (Florida!) born Cuban, I know Cuban food and this is Cuban food. I've tried Havana Cafe and wasn't a fan. Mimita's definitely my speed, and the service is fantastic. On more than one occassion I've rolled into here and had an opportunity to try everything but the tried and true favorite would be the Cuban Sandwich. Don't wait, get there and try it. You won't regret it."
1,"Ah Sapporo. Where the cougars attack with liquid courage. Or where the Tommy Bahama wearing men are on the prowl with blind ignorance. If you are looking for the one place that has more desperate single men and women looking for that potential match, then head on over to the bar at Sapporo for happy hour.  The scene on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday evening pretty much sums up every bad rep that North Scottsdale has. This place and Barcelona, of course. But, I will say the group of guys that flock here looking for some loving is actually entertaining to watch. \n\nThe food here is marginal. The sushi is average at best. The service is spotty. The only reason to go here is the teppenyaki, which doesn't even measure up to  Benihana. Which means, just go to Benihana instead (and I don't even like Benihana). \n\nHere's quick advice on whether a place is good or not. If the place has 5 hostesses that are about 16-20 years old, there's a good chance the food isn't good."
3,"Where do I begin, Caf\u00e9 Rio? I can't remember the last time I craved a salad... but you've made me love lettuce like no other. Of course, once you fill a tin with a warm, chewy tortilla, rice, beans, marinated chicken and some famous lime cilantro dressing--how could you not love the lettuce you pile on top so generously? The chicken breast salad at Caf\u00e9 Rio has more flavor than most 4 course meals. It's refreshing, filling and will make your taste buds shake their maracas. I've also had a chicken quesadilla, also delicious, and bites of Mike's enchiladas and burritos. We also love their queso and chips and love to get an extra freshly made tortilla to dip in the queso. Their tortillas are divine. Thick and chewy, always warm and perfectly cooked. \nIf there was a drawback to this place, it wouldn't be the food, but the crazy people that scream at you for your order. I always feel a bit rushed getting through the line and making sure you got what you want. They're quick to move onto the next person (because there's always a line--sign of a good place!) and if you're not careful, you'll be left in the dust. \nOverall, their food makes up for any of the customer service issues. We've been to a couple of locations and always have a good meal. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some casual Mexican dining."
4,Customer service at it's best.  Everyone here is super friendly and willing to to help you out with just about anything you need.\n\nI was in there this weekend and they really went above & beyond what they needed to do for me.  All I have to say is THANK YOU!!!
4,"A business associate treated my husband and me to dinner last night at Posh in Scottsdale, and while I definitely don't believe this restaurant is for everyone, the three of us really enjoyed it.\n\nI think you have to have an open mind and be willing to try new things to really appreciate Posh.  You don't \""order\"" a dinner but rather you cross off of a list of possible dishes the foods you don't like, and make notes about other things you won't (or can't) eat, and indicate how many courses you want to be served.  Then the Chefs get to work and prepare the number of dishes to serve and you won't know what you're getting until they put it in front of you.\n\nThe food itself was amazing - small portions - maybe four bites each (I'm not a big eater but had the 5 course.  Four courses would have probably still been plenty, I couldn't have managed 6), but beautifully presented and really tasty.  For example, my two favorite courses were the Wild Boar Bacon served with a polenta pancake and a slice of grilled apple (it was SO good I couldn't bring myself to share any with my husband and friend), and the braised short-rib served with a mashed purple yam compote and baby carrots (which was also so good that I realized by this time that I just had to share it, and both agreed that it was amazingly good).\n\nIf there is something on the list of possibilities that you want to be SURE you get to experience, just put a \""Yes\"" next to it.\n\nMy only recommendation is that you consider carefully if you want to order the \""with wine\"" courses, which means that you get a 'tasting' of wine with each course, not a full glass.   Great idea if you like to taste a variety of wines but don't generally drink much.  If you do, order the courses without wine and then just order a glass or bottle of wine 'a la carte'.\n\nAll in all Posh is a great place to take someone you want to impress, or to celebrate something special, or if you just want a fun experience and don't care about the cost.  It was pricey (very) but worth it, and I would definitely go again."
2,"The atmosphere was good. Great place to hang out with friends, chow down on chips and salsa, and drink a few drinks. Overall, the food and service was average."
2,"We tried pretty much every thing on the menu. The best items were the Strip Steak served with a heated rock for cooking, blueberry saki and the albacore tuna belly sushimi... other then that the food isn't great. The atmosphere is what keeps it a 3 for me."
4,"My wife's car was broken into and our house keys & some I.D. were stolen, so the low life knew what the house keys were to.  I called Master Lock & Security and Carmon came out in 2 hours and re-keyed 12 tumblers all the same in a couple hours and gave us 4 keys  A little pricey I thought,  but great service.  I recommend Master Lock & Security AKA 24/7 Superteck Locksmith."
1,Nice staff. Lousy sandwich. \nMy first sandwich turned out to be a bad idea. I tried the pastramy but couldnt eat it due to the horrible 1000 island sauce on it. Its just terrible with the sweetness of that sauce. They put it on both pieces of bread so I couldnt even eat half. \nI might try something else but one of these is enough for me.
4,"AMAZING. \n\nI've only been to Cibo for dinner, but it's one of the few restaurants that i've been to HUNDREDS of times. I cringe whenever I hear someone talking about going to pizzaria Bianco, bec Cibo's pizza is exponentially better and you won't face the hours of waiting that you'll run into at Bianco. \n\nEsp. recommend going to dinner here when it's a bit cooler... they have live music, a fire pit, and beautiful outdoor dining."
1,"Room was small, not much better than  a Holiday Inn Express.  Air conditioner didn't work in our room, they brought us a fan (we moved to a new room the next day).  Staff very unfriendly.  Bathroom very small.  Pool area very plain.  Good location.  Would not stay there again."
0,"The reason for the one star is simply due to the attitude and service of the people that work here. Rude on the call in order, rude when picking up and not a thank you in sight. No offering of napkins, choice of dressing on a salad or utensils. With all the choices in Vegas, the owner had better have a talk with the employees. I will go elsewhere."
4,"Woooow, impressed, friendly dentist and assist, before I came here the last time I em was at a dentist office was like 16 years In one of those scare of dentist but this guys made me feel very comfy, love it very clean and on time with appt :)"
2,Good drinks with some run of the mill tapas. Nothing was innovative which I don't mind since it wasn't to expensive. My food taste a little burnt which is what cost it the fourth star. Overall it's worth trying and you may like it better than I did.
4,"On our first morning in Vegas during our most recent trip, I just typed in Best Breakfast in Yelp and this restaurant came up! I was lured by the fact that Adam from Man Vs Food had come here and wanted to try it out! \n\nThe location: Imperial Palace.. My first thought: REALLY?! Uff. But off we went!\n\nImperial Palace was going through major renovations.. The entire front section was closed off.. We had to park next door at Bill's? I think that's what it was called.. After nearly falling to my death by slipping on wet floors, we located the restaurant which was on the second floor. Once you go up there, it's like you're not even in Imperial Palace anymore! The restaurant decor was really cool and hip (awesome that I just used that word, I know). The wait was about 20 minutes.. I'm not sure if they took reservations but we just walked in. \n\nI tried the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. OH MY GOODNESS. I was IN LOVE with this dish. When it came out, I swear I thought that I could probably only finish half (the portion was HUGE. It was the size of a small dog). But to my surprise.. I finished 80% of it. Shocking, I know. But you guys, this was so amazing. It was biscuit.. mashed potatoes.. scrambled eggs.. cheese.. fresh spinach.. fried chicken.. chipotle sauce.. OMG the goodness was overwhelming! I could NOT stop EATING and probably gained 3lbs but it was AMAZING! And I can't wait to go back!\n\nALSO! PS - get the Kiwi Watermelon drink. Super yummy!"
2,"I'm not a huge club fan so I will say I probably won't give the best review.  Here it goes.  It's to damn DARK in this, walls, floor, doors, bar and stage all painted black.  Must of been a sale at Home Depot on black paint.  They also have nothing to deflect sound so the sound bounces off the bare black walls.  Unpleasant experience, except for a couple of years ago I worked for Taco Bell and their food truck sat in front and we passed out free food... now that was fun.  :-)  BTW, I don't work for taco bell so don't try and hit me up for free food."
2,Beef tacos were very good (4-star). Guacamole was runny and had some rind/pit in it.  Other sides were just OK.
4,"Its a train wreck of food coming at my face and I can't look away!!\n\nAnyplace that serves fried chicken for breakfast really gets me!!\n\nIf you're looking for a more manageable meal try the corned beef or any of the other hashes. They're still big portions, but look reasonable compared to everything else!"
0,"I will NEVER, EVER go back here. End of story. \n\nI went with the boyfriend right after it opened in Feb. '08. It was some special neither of us paid cover and it was $5 cosmos for ladies. The funny thing is my beer drinking BF ordered a Cosmo and received it for $5, maybe the waitress thought this funny or something, I sure did. \n\nAnyway, the music was out of sync between the two piano players, the kitchen was closed and it was only 10 or 11 PM and the guy playing the piano reminded me of a super annoying Joe Pesci with his dumb jokes. They embarrassed some drunk girl on her birthday with really vulgar stuff. \n\nI'm not a prude, in fact I'm pretty foul mouthed and minded, but if this guy said that stuff to me I probably would have knocked him right off his piano stool. \n\nWe finished the only drink we ordered, payed our bill and booked it to The Yardhouse to enjoy the reverse happy hour and some beer."
2,Just reviewing the cupcakes...I forgot I had these cupcakes for an event at work. I suppose they weren't very memorable. The flavors were vanilla and chocolate combinations. I need to visit their actual shop and sample some more creative flavors as well as their menu.
2,"Good jukebox selection, but the tables here have seen better days."
2,"Place is okay looking... Server \""short lady long ponytail\"" was rude and as if she didnt like taking any orders... She reaches on our table back n forth without saying excuse me... Lol \n\nI ordered melon juice... The melon seems very hard however the juice is good. We also got pork sinigang, very good however the meat should be made with less pork fat. Pansit palabok tasted ok n beef caldereta is good."
2,"OK, I've eaten here twice now.  The first time was about two years ago, and I remember my entree as being very tasty and worth a second visit.  The second time was last week, and my entree this time was just okay.  Nothing special.  However....I have to rave about their caprese salad with imported mozarella cheese.  It was awesome!  My wife and I just returned from a two-week Italy tour, and we ate all Italian food and drank a lot of Italian wine.  We had our share of caprese salads, and I tell you, Trattoria Reggiano's caprese salad is as good, or better, than those served in Italy!  It is worth recommending.  They use imported buffalo mozarella, and it is wonderfully delicious.  You must try it, even if you're so-so on tomatoes.  The combination is terrific and not to be missed.\n\nAs for an entree, I would suggest maybe ordering something with a sauce other than tomato based.  Their pasta is very good al dente; I just think a sauce other than tomato-based gives more suble taste and texture back to the pasta dish itself.  Next time I'm here I'll try the veal.  \n\nDo not be dissuaded from trying this Trattoria from the setting.  Yes, it is in a hotel mall next to a magic shop and a Coffee Bean, but the food is good and it is run by genuine Italians.  Not as expensive as the numerous famous chefs' restaurants at the Venetian Hotel, not in as nice a setting, but the proof is in the pasta and sauces. Give it a go; I don't think you'll regret it.  Sit \""outside\"" and people-watch.  And don't forget the Caprese Salad!"
1,"I had high hopes for this place.  The menu looks great, lots of options and fresh choices.  But I've given it a couple of tries, and the food just isn't anything special.  I've had the pear and goat cheese salad, and the portobello pizza.  The ingredients didn't seem fresh, and both dishes seemed hastily thrown together.  There are better places to eat."
1,"Cute place, pretty pastries, 1/2 way decent service and surly back of house. The short and not so sweet story: two of us ordered the veggie club for a late lunch, unfortunately said sandwich came out with mayo on it, totally unexpected since it was not in the description though it was listed for other sandwiches, plus the club was touted as being made with tomato basil jam on vegan bread so I didn't even think to ask if it had mayo...Anyway, I do not, under any circumstances, eat mayo. I went up to the counter and verified that it was indeed mayo. The counterperson was nice and she offered me a half sandwich without mayo. The kitchen person said she couldn't make a half sandwich. So I said, how about just a two layer club, instead of the three (like one piece of bread cut in half and assembled together with some veggies? The counterperson seemed to understand this to be a solution and I thought I had some lunch coming. But It never came. I would have liked to have witnessed some cooperative communication instead of a timid server trying (but not hard enough) to make good in spite of an oppressive bitch. I would have paid for another damn sandwich if that's all it would have taken to get fed, or I would have left to find lunch elsewhere if I had been informed that my request was unreasonable. Disgusted, I decided just to get a soy latte on my way out, but they did not have the soymilk that they advertised on the board for an extra $.50, the icing on the cake of my void. So, I don't trust the chalk board, I sure as sugar can't rely on the staff to work together as a team and judging by my sweet toothed partner's reaction, I don't even believe they can make a good cookie."
2,"Warning: This place is not for the neat, tidy, or sensitive. This is a place to get rowdy, get messed up, and plain out be a total douche.\n\nI didn't get any food here since the food prices are pretty crazy and just spent my time nursing a pitcher of beer. They had a pretty good cover band playing and that was probably the highlight of my experience here (besides the explicit message written on our bill haha).\n\nService here is definitely more for the entertainment and almost borders on being disservice. \n\nNot sure I'd come back .. we'll see."
3,"If you are looking for Ono grinds that remind you of home cooking on the islands, this is the place. Boiled peanuts are a nice surprise. Good service. Cabbage, turnip and cucumber kimchees are delicious."
0,"Yet another bad restaurant in this same site. We have lived here 5 years-3 different restaurants-this local must be jinxed. The food actually made my husband and I sick! They say \""home cooked\"" and it was truly something a home cook would prepare. No presentation, bad decor, and very slow service. Prices were high for the quality of food presented.\n\nThis one is named Bosewell's."
0,I usually hate it when people say they wish they could give 0 stars - obviously I have just never have an experience that warranted it until now! My experience reads just like so many other negative reviews of Tao.\n\nI ate at the restaurant and the food was fine but not fantastic. The price of the food however was what you would pay for amazing food. I had no problem with that however until I experienced the night club. I guess since they are considered one of the strip's top clubs (which is totally undeserved) they feel like they can have terrible attitudes. Maybe they even think being rude adds to their desirability. Whatever the reason the staff didn't know how to treat anyone and the club was so crowded we could barely move much less actually dance. \n\nStill I didn't have a huge problem until a large guard got overly aggressive with me. This man was literally about 4 times my size and got in my face when I called him out for being rude and speaking to people like they were dogs. When he got in my personal space and I still refused to back down he called over the real cops like a whiny little punk. The real cops agreed with me that the guards at Tao are on a power trip and this is the only way they have to feel good about themselves.\n\nWhat's worse is that the security guard manager did absolutely nothing about it. I have been to Vegas many times and have never had a negative experience before this. Needless to say I will never go back to this establishment.
0,"I cannot explain how upset I am about this restaurant. I used to love this place, I thought the food was delicious. Then, Friday, a coworker and I went to pick up takeout on our lunch hour. First, they do not accept all major credit cards, FYI, just visa and MasterCard. My friend and I ordered and 45 minutes later, still our orders were not ready. We asked for a refund and I asked for the owners name. The girl behind the counter said, \""oh he went outback.\"" Never getting an answer. Then, she finally refunded our money since our food never came out! I called later to ask for the owner, this time the same young girl said, \""SHE isn't here today!\"" \n\nJust very frustrating because I really enjoyed going there, but what's the point if the food I order isn't ready within an hour!"
0,"This place simply sucks, I have been here three times and it's the same experience...the staff hate their job and therefore dealing with customers, the beef or the chicken for the hot sandwiches is always pre-cooked and saved in a fridge so they just warm it up on the hot grill, which at the end is no big deal. What  I don't understand is  why they always hire employees who look like bums, tonight I was there and they still have the girl with  tattoos and piercings all over...honestly, it doesn't look very hygienic, never mind the hostile attitude from her towards the customers, if she hates her job so much then she should quit and move on to other challenges. She seems to be annoyed by the customers, doesn't even bother to look at them when shes speaking, looks annoyed  if a customer asks what  this veggie or that condiment are, she makes the pita sandwich and dumps it (literally) on the counter. That attitude could fit if she worked at a jail or at a soup kitchen, but not in a place where customers are paying for their food. The other girl at the register is a lot friendlier and more pleasant, I must admit. The only good thing about this place is that they are downstairs and close late at night, and that is the only reason why now and then I spend my money there...other than that I'd rather go Subway, which is next door, or have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at home."
3,"I love firebirds and eat here often, they have one of the best hamburgers around if you are willing to pay the $$ also addicted to their house salad... great specials during the week and the bar area is a nice place to relax, especially when its cold and the fireplace is going."
1,"So when I bought a house in the neighborhood, I was happy to have the local drinking hole McDuffys right across the street to go to for a beer and enjoy some sports. When it closed down I was pretty bummed out, but upon hearing it would be reopening I was excited the area would have a sports bar again.\n\nWhile the beer variety (which appears will be rotating) and the TV selections is great, I really can't figure out what the heck the decision makers are thinking. \n\nFrom my knowledge, Dukes has been open around 2 months and they still can't seem to get signage up on the building and instead have cheap banners that upon night time no one can tell there is anything open from the street short of an \""open\"" sign. The menus are also in poor shape and look like they were intended to be temporary but never bothered to change it. \n\nThey also seem to be having a problem of keeping staff (which explains all the complaints about being understaffed and the help wanted signs). Obviously there is a problem with management or owners that staff (including the cooks) keep not showing up or quitting. I'm not sure how much longer they can survive without making changes needed to keep the place staffed and customers happy.\n\nThe food is a toss up, I suppose depending on who is actually in the kitchen that day. I've had decent food and bad food there. \n\nFinally, if the biker bar thing is true.. I anticipate Dukes falling the way of McDuffys and shutting its doors because of the crowds they are bringing in. I know I'll be bringing my business elsewhere (Zipps, Blue 32, TeakWoods, BWW, all within a close drive) if rather than going to enjoy a beer and some football it's filled with a bunch of bikers. This place is surrounded by residential and schools, a biker bar seems completely out of place.\n\nOnly redeeming part of this place so far has been the bartenders being friendly."
4,"This place has NEVER disappointed when it comes to the food coming out of their kitchen. The lines occasionally go out the door but the wait is never very long. I have had many different items off the menu as it is a place my girlfriend and I frequent.\n\nIf you can ever get the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, I would highly recommend, and this is coming from a very country boy who was raised on amazing pepper gravy and biscuits. I would be at Dor-Stop all the time if they had the sausage gravy on demand.\n\nNote: This is not the norm and the waitress seemed to be having a bad day. The only problem I have ever really had was when one of the waitresses didn't put forth much effort. She never stopped by to fill our drinks. Asked for our order and that was it. Even though we were friendly and polite, we never received the same in return. I understand that people have bad days. The waitresses here are very nice, but they are human and have their off days. Like I said, this was only one time, and on a subsequent visit, she was much more cheery and friendly. Everyone is human.\n\nI would recommend that anyone in the area give this place a try for breakfast and lunch."
2,"Anticipating the pizza craving that I always get after happy hour I'm going to pre-order a 10\"" original deep dish, mushrooms, spinach, and homemade sausage from the nearby Nellos for tonight.\n\nNellos crust, on any occasion, is one of my favorites. There's something magical about it. The bottom of the crust is just firm and thick enough to withstand the weight of the fresh and flavorful toppings. The combination of the bottom of the crust and the fresh and homemade toppings is just the beginning. \n\nThe edge of the crust steals the show. The light and dark gold color's of the edge draws you in right away. Each bite starts off crunchy to the tooth and ends with a soft and chewy melt in your mouth dough. The crust is a big component on why their pizza is so delicious.\n\nI've only been to their Ahwatukee location but I'm sure the other locations are just as good. Their pizzas and their tiramisu are worth 4-5 stars but everything else on their menu is just ok. But who needs to try anything else when you have crust like they do."
2,"I was a bit thrown off when i first received the menu. This is a sushi restaurant but they also had Thai and Szechuan food? Usually that means the food isn't necessarily authentic or specialized when they offer other ethnic cuisines. The menu had all sorts of typos like Niso Soup and Sea Weet soup, weird. My boyfriend and I had low expectations and wanted to leave but didn't want to be rude. The waitress was quite unprofessional too. She was nice but she told my boyfriend to pass her his water glass. That's weird too. They should be serving us, not asking us to do things for them. Anyway, we ordered only a few rolls: avocado, spicy salmon, fish roe, and veggie roll. The presentation was actually surprisingly nice. Also the spicy salmon was VERY good. In general this place, their sushi i'd say is not bad. But it's not the best or the greatest. Service needs to be better and they need to fix the typos in their menus."
0,"I know what The Marvel Experience feels like whenever I've gone and seen a Marvel movie. Fun, excitement, laughter. All joyous emotions. I felt none of that during this experience. This was just flat out horrible on many levels. \n\nI avoided the dreaded $10 parking fee that others encountered. When I went with a buddy of mine Sunday night it was pretty dead. Guess the bad word of mouth had made it thru by then. \n\nThe staff was just so blah. No excitement or enthusiasm of any kind. But I will say that it was at night so maybe they are just tired from repeating the same stuff over and over.\n\nThe \""interactive\"" stuff isn't much. It felt very cheap and that they were thinking. Let's just slap the name Marvel on it and people will love it. The Spider-man wall climb was just a regular rock climbing wall that moved. Would it have killed them to make a rock climbing wall that looked like the side of a high rise building? Or something like a magnet or velcro suit that let's u stick to walls? Dome 1 mostly consisted of monitors that had the origins of the characters which were all covered many times before in Marvel movies and cartoons. And the noise level of the dome drowned out the sound of the televisions, so you couldn't hear anything anyways. The \""museum\"" was a joke. I was thinking it was a hall of Marvel history with props from some of the actual movies. All the props looked like plastic toys you could get a any toy store. Most of the games didn't work right. The holo simulator was ok, but it felt cheap. As far as computer animation has come along the graphics for the heroes in dome 1 was very lackluster. \n\nThe Quinjet that was advertised so much as a life size one that you wouldn't believe it was all one piece. Was just pretty much a wing. There was no cockpit or seats or anything like that. Just more monitors telling you about the origins of the villains.\n\nThey took away our initial bracelets when we reached Dome 2 and I for one have no idea why they gave them to us to begin with. Cause they told us when we first walked in that those bracelets they gave us didn't work. It just made no sense at all. The 3d movie was cool but it ends right when it starts getting good with no conclusion and the staff ushers you right into the next room. The 4d ride was fun for what it was. But again without those bracelets working the part where they want you to interact falls flat. \n\nThe gift shop was full of overpriced items and not many things to choose from.  It consisted of a certain amount of items just spaced out in different parts of the gift shop. \n\nAll in all for $37 its a major ripoff. I would feel like a straight idiot if I paid for the VIP package. The games are the same type of games you would find in a Peter Piper. You would think they would have people dressed up in character costumes walking around the place for photo ops. And it basically focus on The Avengers. If its a true Marvel experience where were all the hundreds of characters that they have in their library?\n \nIf your a 5 year old kid. This place is a blast. I got excited when I first pulled up to the place and I saw those huge domes all glowing and the music blaring. But if your a true Marvel fan thinking your going to go into the mecca of the world of Marvel universe. You'll come out very very VERY disappointed."
4,"I think I came in here with the right expectation. I wanted a burger, some kind of pub appetizer, and a few beers, and that's exactly what I got. service, good. beer, good. burgers, great! and all for a fair price. \n\nmy bf and I both ordered the Bacon Avocado Burger, and I asked for the burger cooked well done. it showed up looking tasty, charred on the outside and juicy on the inside. bacon on the burger was crisp, and the avocado was fresh and tasty. \n\nI had the sweet potato tots, and bf had the fries, I ate all mine and cleaned his leftovers. they were both SO good, just about the perfect sides for our burgers. \n\nwe also ordered the pretzels, and while the cheese sauce was thin, it was packed with flavor. \n\nwe sat on the bar side, wasn't too smoky and we could vape at the bar. very friendly!! will go back when I'm craving a burger again."
2,"Food is decent, not the best but will do. Atmosphere seemed a bit off or lost, service is slow and waiters are forgetful but friendly. Decent portion and price however."
1,"I was not impressed by the pizza by any means. The red sauce had no flavor and there was very little seasoning on the pizza with the regular red sauce. The garlic sauce, on the other hand, was really delicious and I regret not getting it."
1,"Decent stadium on the inside.  Good facilities and well maintained\n\nTerrible dirt lot for tailgating.  I dont see why the grounds are better kept.  Lastly, for people visiting, it is way the hell out there.  Like most people that dont rent cars in Vegas, it is painfully fair (both in time, and to the wallet).\n\nI will come here every 2 years to see my team play the Rebels, and will enjoy the company of friends, but it wont be because of a killer stadium (unlike other places)"
3,"Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner, bartender was great.\n\nFood was your standard chops and fish. Very well prepared and tasty. Also a great wine list - I recommend the 2003 Lascombes if you like Bordeaux.\n\nThe location isnt the best (downtown) if you are looking for fun afterward."
0,"A little too expensive. Bad haircut. \nIf going here for a men's haircut, avoid Renee."
1,"They have the outside and inside of the restaurant decorated lavishly, but that's probably to make up for their less than mediocre food. I ordered a cheese quesadilla, and it left much to be desired. The chips were also nothing special. Nobody else in my party enjoyed their food either."
4,"I dont know what everyone is freaking about... the resort fees- everyone on the strip, or almost everyone has them. they cover the wifi, the newspaper, water bottles in the room, 20 dollars off your next stay vip passes to the sirens show and to the ed hardy themed club or whatever it is.., etc.... basic things. When I complained about it to the supervisor- because last time i stayed i didn't pay (they just passe this on Oct 1st) she gave me 2 breakfasts for me and my husband for our upcoming trip and bumped us up for free to the petite suite again like we had for our honeymoon, and paid under 400 for that with taxes, fees and all that for 4 nights.\n\nI think Isla is a great place, a little pricey but worth it. The casino itself to me was a bit small, but the view we had with our room in October was amazing and had a great strip view. WE saw the mystere too, which was ok- if anyone saw knocked up, its the show they saw in that.\n\noverall, we cant wait to come back in Aug for my husbands birthday. Another plus noon checkout, and if you call they bump it to 1. a great bonus on top of the remodeled rooms and BEST beds Ive ever slept on."
1,"After a miserable experience at Maze in NYC, I decided to give Gordon's restaurants another shot because I am actually a fan of his. Unfortunately, this experience wasn't any better. When the waiter took our drink order, I asked for the Strongbow cider on draft. They were out...on a Tuesday afternoon. Gordon Ramsay's pub was out of English cider! Ok, so I asked for the pear cider...nope. They were out of that too. My lunch was pretty bad. I ordered the lamb burger, and when it came out, the bottom bun was already bloody and soggy...inedible. Yuck! I was actually surprised they had the nerve to bring it out to me. I tried to eat the rest of the burger and the meat was almost too gamey to eat. I know some lamb meat has that flavor characteristic, but this was bad. I've had a good lamb burger before and I can assure you this isn't it. All negatives put aside, my wife ordered the \""spotted dic\"" desert and that was about the best desert either of us have ever tasted before. I recommend this place for that and maybe some cider if they aren't out. Stay away from the lamb burger, though. Ughh..."
0,The worst food I've ever had. The meat was boiled which gave off a foul odor! I got beef fried rice and tofu pad tai! I'm hoping it wasn't boiled horse meat! \nIgnore the one star! It wouldn't let me post without!!!!
4,"Fry Bread is really a lot like fried dough, but this restaurant takes it to a whole new level. My favorite is the beef and vegetable stew, but they have tacos and dessert stuff too. All centered around fry bread of course. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. There is not wait staff. You order and they call your name.The night that I went most recently was a busy night because of a fair that was happening on 7th ave, so the food took about 10 minutes, but usually it's pretty prompt."
3,"Was here Tue/24 Sep with a coupla friends:\n- This night it was free entrance for locals and we had one of those \""free VIP entrance for ladies\"" club pass for our British friend.\n- This was the 3rd time I've been to Pure and it's cool.  There are counter-level tables (but no barstools) which any one can occupy (ie no bottle service required).\n- Fireball shot is $12 and a small Fiji water is $8."
3,Great location with a drive-thru. I never have to wait too long for a drink when I walk on or use the drive-thru. The beverages are made the way I order them and I have never had any issues.
3,"Good food, okay atmosphere. Ordered takeout for two, had a local beer at the bar while I waited. Has an older crowd feel. Bar looks outdated and a little messy."
1,I came to Scottsdale a few weeks ago.  One of the things I wanted to do is go to a Dunkin Donuts since I hadn't been there in years (when they were last in California).  We went to two different stores and the donuts weren't the same has I remembered.  The donut shop down the street from my home in California has better donuts than these two stores.  We did have the steak breakfast sandwich and coffee which were good but I just wasn't excited about the taste of the donuts I try ed.   The staff behind the counter wasn't friendly at either store.   I was so disappointed I kind of wished I hadn't gone there and keep my good memory of the great donuts I had years ago.
0,I would avoid this hotel. The live to get their hands in your credit card. They will post random charges constantly without permission. I am also a Wyndom client and am totally blown away they can't do something to the management here for their fraudulent activities.
2,It's worth a look. Usually not as great as you would expect but there are the little surprises.
2,"Great value, vibe and vegetarian choices. Skip pad Thai and go for the tacos. Great start although still working out the kinks with a big creative menu."
0,"Stayed here four times over five years. Each time it got worse. Was assigned a smoking room when we specifically asked for nonsmoking. They had a convention and said no other rooms were available. The room stank of smoke, was filfthy dirty with cigarette burns on the furniture, drapes and bedspread.  There were no toiletries. Asked front desk for housekeeping and they never came even after two requests.\nStay away!"
4,Lunch buffet was fabulous! A good number and variety of dishes to choose from. Friendly and attentive staff as well. Must try if you like Indian.
2,"** Review for PHO\n\nI had their steak Pho and was immediately greeted by a plate of wilted basil, wilted bean sprouts, 1 little lime and no jalapenos.  Not a good start.  The Pho itself was \""ok\"" but nothing special.  The meat was very sparse and very small pieces and the Pho portion in it's entirety was pretty small for the $7 price tag.  The broth was, again, just \""ok\"" and didn't stand out as \""awesome\"" or \""great\""."
3,"during my latest trip to lv, my friends and i came here for dinner one night. my first impressions upon being seated: the hosts are attractive, the decor is modern and dig the extended glass separators, and 'damn those complimentary fries look delicious'. the restaurant's open space does not make it a quiet evening, but that's not what i was looking for! i ordered the prime rib, cooked medium. i was a little concerned about the servings being small, but was pleasantly surprised upon it's arrival. the meat was cooked to perfection. although i was a little surprised with how it was charred at the bottom, as i never had prime rib like this. but it didn't stop me from finishing it. we all shared sides of the creamed corn, mac & cheese, and scalloped potatoes. all the sides were very rich, but delicious.\n\nbut what makes me a fan of this place is their service, and willingness to accept a couple of my requests. one of the chefs actually came by our table and asked how everything was. also - the day after, i received an email from one of the team members, ashley, thanking us for our dining experiences. that was a nice touch..."
4,Great work from these two guys . They are very  professional at all times and cheap. Definitely going to call them again when needed :)
2,"I'll have 10 wings and ....Bread Sticks... (What the ....)\n\nOK so my nearest Buffalo's Southwest Cafe closed down last week which offered a good selection of 49 Cent wings on Tuesdays..... so I decided to give these guys a try tonight, after-all it is new business, so why not just see what this place is about. \n\nUpon entering this very small business, we were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked if we were in for the first time, we stated yes, and he explained the menu choices......OK they serve chicken, chicken, and chicken. To be more specific they serve chicken. We chose the chicken.\n\nI noticed the seating area contained two TV's not an extensive selection of sports to choose from as they advertised, but at least two and a half men was on so I felt I was \""WINNING\"".\n\nThe tea dispenser was unusual, as it contained sweet and un-sweet tea.  You push a button to select your choice, however the teas tasted of an instant type of concentrated tea, which was not  good at all.  Off to the nice Coca-Cola fountain drink machine located beside it.  The ice was cold, fresh and when added to the Coca-Cola it was very refreshing.\n\nThe meals we chose were: Chicken Tenders, and the Chicken Wings ( I have added a picture of both meals) I was unfamiliar with Garlic bread sticks with the chicken wings, but they were hot, fresh, and drenched in butter.  They were good, but again, with chicken wings? \n\nIt would be nice if they had a wider menu selection, beside chicken, however it is nothin' but FRICK\""N Chicken.\n\nI wish these folks well in the chicken business, but because of the limited menu items, and the oddity of the bread-sticks, the prices are too high to maintain a viable business........prove me wrong, but I assure you, this place will be gone by December 2011. \n\nNCFoodGuy"
1,"I saw the above-average reviews on Yelp about this restaurant, and decided to come by to try my luck. Not so fast, because this was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have had in the last several months. \n\nWe arrived for dinner, as a huge group of 25+ people were leaving the restaurant. Service was dismally slow, as my friend and I sat there staring at the counter waiting for someone to take our orders. When they finally brought us a glass of water each, as well as the side dishes, the water was the most disgusting water I have ever tasted; either someone did not wash the glasses right, or the pipes in the establishment are filthy, because the water tasted like buttermilk. \n\nWhen the waiters got around to acknowledging us, the service was otherwise pleasant and attentive, and our waitress was very helpful in explaining the dishes. Food was otherwise quite tasty, I ordered a bibim kook soo that was everything I would expect from a Korean restaurant like this. \n\nAt the end of the meal however, as I was eating some kimchi, I found an odd-looking vegetable in there, and lo and behold, there's a pickled flying insect inside of a leaf! Those cooks in the back really need to wash their vegetables better. Sorry to say, but my experience here was just awful."
1,"Probably some of the least impressive rooms I've ever seen in Las Vegas. The casino and Paris vibe are decent, but not happy with the rest of my experience.\n\nThe rooms are standard hotel rooms. They must've decided not to carry the Paris theme into the rooms for some reason. And there seemed to be a lot of wear and tear in the rooms. The TVs are old and the remote hardly worked.\n\nThe worst part was the nickel and diming. They wouldn't let me check into my room a couple hours early without paying an extra $25. Wouldn't be so bad, except their check-in times were like 4pm. Also, internet is not free.\n\nI guess like everything in Vegas, the whole purpose is to get you there and then slowly take money away from you. For some reason I expected more from the Paris."
4,The house margaritas here are the greatest margaritas in the world. They are quite possibly the greatest drink in the world. They are strong too. These will boogie woogie on your brain!
0,"Very disappointing.  The service was awful: Our waiter didn't even make the effort to check whether or not I could still get the tartare (even though it was 1:55; he said \""If it's 2 pm then it's too late.\""  What kind of attitude is that?) and was unfriendly overall.  The burger was ok, but I was extremely put off by the poor service above and beyond everything else.  Another one of those overpriced, snotty \""trendy\"" places that don't care about their costumers."
1,"What you expect out of a 24 hour diner.  Food can be pretty good, service can be pretty bad."
3,Beautiful and new !
3,"I was pleased by a cup of Ethiopia Adulina brewed with some Clever-like contraption (immersion with filter) was good. I worried that it would be too bright, but it's got some sweetness that balanced things out. Reasonable price, too. The guy who took my order was pretty friendly. Either the wifi was down or they don't have wifi. The cafe has a big sliding glass window that they open up when weather permits, letting the fresh air in."
2,Nice but a bit bland- nothing overly exceptional about it. It's a standard hotel. A plus is the free wifi and the valet parking.
2,"I used to like RR but after trying it recently, it just doesn't seem as good. Had the holiday turkey burger and the patty was pretty awful. The turkey meat was that overly soft processed type meat. For over $10, I didn't think it was worth it Fatburger's turkey burger is cheaper and much more worth it. Bf prefers the $6 burger at Flemings at happy hour. I'd probably rate the food a 2 star but I know RR has such good customer service so hence the extra star."
2,"If you  have young or young at heart children you need to bring them here at least once..the decor can keep someone with add sitting still...wait staff is pretty friendly..food by and large was just ok and a little pricey for what you got, that being said the menu is very expansive and i cant imagine someone going there and not being able to find something they want to try..there is a carousel out front for kids to ride which is another plus for the kids."
2,"SOOOOOOOOOO OVER-RATED!!!!! oh man... The only cool thing about this coffee shop is the really cool environment and the super friendly staff...other than that, the coffee is boring!"
2,A little pricey but not bad. Had the steak and cheese. More salad than meat.
2,"I do like the cinnamon sugar pretzels and the bites and the pretzel dogs.  This time the bites were a bit over cooked or sat around too long as they were chewy in a bad way.  Taste was okay, texture not, calories definitely not."
4,Amazing cocktails. Great food. Awesome service.
3,"I have been coming here for years. Literally since it first was opened, 15 years ago. The Casino itself is nice and has a lot to offer! Plenty of slots and empty tables. Don't get me wrong, this place is always packed with locals. The movie theatre and sports book bring a lot of excitement to this location. Not to mention the $1 bowling at certain hours of the night. TGIFridays was a great addition to this already nice hotel/casino. Rooms here are above standard and not too pricey. You can get a pretty sweet view of the strip, if requested. Private parking for rewards members..."
2,"We come here alot on Wed nights for family night, it is super cheap like half price cheap for a OK Mexican meal. They use way to much cheese on everything and it can be quite heavy as Mexican can be. This place is not my favorite but my husband LOVES the chips and salsa so we come often. when we leave I always say \"" we are not coming here for a while\"" but we always return so he can get his fix. I am from Cali and they do good Mexican there so I have never found my holly grail Mexican restaurant in Phoenix but I am hopeful and keep trying  thanks to Yelp I just might find it."
1,"our second stop for az restaurant week 2012. because it's listed with many, many dollar signs, i just pass this place up. but with restaurant week prices and the reputation that Posh has, we couldn't not finally try.\n\neveryone knows where it is, so i'll spare the lush garden surrounding description. the layout is sleek but very loud. almost like a bar loud....not music, but the conversation decibel level is very high. i found myself more yelling at our dinner companions than talking. \n\nwe sat at the counter watching all the happenings going on. it was neat to see all the equipment and hub-bub of the chefs. our server was extremely helpful and down-to-earth...i expected huffy and aloof...she was neither. i did think it was funny to have my water described as \""still\"".\n\ni am skinny but i eat like an obese person. this is NOT the place to go for a filling meal. and i am not the gastonomic extraordinaire i thought i was. i could not appreciate any of the dishes that came to me when i'm left hungry at the end of the night. none of my plates were warm food(maybe that was the intent). the artichoke dish had barely an edible portion of artichoke (it was tough and stringy), and my tuna dish was overcooked. and i don't understand how places expound on the slivers of sauce on a plate when you can't get but a smidgen on the utensil to even taste.\n\nmy wife liked her meal, our guests left alot of their meals on their plates. when we got home, i ate a big bowl of cereal because i was so hungry. \n\nyes, it's just me. this place has many, many excellent reviews for perhaps palates and wallets that are way more refined than mine. i tried it, wasn't impressed, now i move on."
2,"\""A-OK\"" is a nice way to put it. \n\nThe show isn't much, but the price you can't beat. I would say nice way to start the night with a few laughs.\n\nIt's a good time if the crowd gets into it."
1,"The ride doesn't worth the money. It costs $25 at day time and $35 at night time. A $2 fee per ticket was charged at the ticket booth. \n\nIt was crowded. There were about 30 people in the pod. During the ride, the people were standing on the strip side and blocking the view. They don't want to walk around and look at the other side. I saw the people with different hair styles. :(\n\nI think it is better to spend the money to upgrade the hotel room, go up to the Eiffel Tower or take the helicopter ride."
3,"The downside to this hotel is the incredibly loud A/C, which doesn't really keep the temperature of the room at the one you set. Some reviewers complained about hearing noise from the INO across the street. I'm pretty sure that was drowned out by my A/C. This'll probably warrant an update once the temperature drops below 107+ degrees.\n\nThe hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe lobby bar, W xyz, is open from 5 pm until midnight.\n\nThere are a few fast food places across the street. After 1 am, you'll need to hit the Denny's across S Rural Rd. A limited bar bites menu at W xyz is available as well.\n\nNote: If you want a bigger room, book a room with 2 queen beds. You will definitely notice much more space on the bathroom countertop, the \""closet,\"" and the desks. Trust me. It's worth it."
0,"Note: I did not eat here.\n\nFirst off, I hate paying more than $10 per plate at a mexican food restaurant because I know a cheap, delicious and fresh place down the street. \n\nSecond, these m-fers gave away our reservations because we were late. Now I know they have to run a business, but I told the lady we were celebrating a birthday. I mean COME ON. \n\nThird, they were rude and wouldn't help us find faster seating so we could catch Ka. SO F-U deigo, we went to pearl and had a great non rude time."
3,Really awesome portions and delivery service and for what it's worth the food is pretty scrumdiddly.
0,Bad service! First hookah was leaking and the guy still have it to us Worst service I have ever received kept calling the guy. Hookah had been harsh for a good while. Never saw the guy again since we walked in
1,"So i'm the only person who hated this show?\n\nHear me out...\n\nI have seen MANY Cirque shows. Therein lay the main problem.\n\nAfter seeing all of them I was able to see most of their previous shows mashed into this one... with the addition of a swimming pool. Which is used for some of the show, but not all.\n\nThis is touted as a water show... correct?\n\nToo bad the pool is covered a majority of the time.\n\nThere's no central theme. I'm not 90 years old, so synchronized swimming doesn't work me into a tizzy. It's a 'circus,' yes, but what's with the EXCESS amount of clown interludes... yes -- clowns, clowns and more clowns. Usually at cirque shows you deal with them as the stage is altered. WRONG.\n\nThey should call \""0\"" the clown show with some short water acts and all the other acrobatics and gymnasts you've seen in every other cirque show.\n\nSkip this and see a Cirque show when it comes close to you."
4,"The  best  show I have ever seen from Cirque, Music, set, everything leaves you Breathless.\nA memory sure to last a lifetime.\nA show not to  miss, if I get the chance will see it again."
1,"So the food is alright but they have a few problems to address!\nFirst is their outrageous prices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nIt's just TOOO much for 1 burrito and NO DRINK!\nSecond is the portions! They are SOOOO GREEDY with the meat!\nThey grab a nice big stack of meat some times and put half back eye balling, no almost counting how many pieces of meat they have the customer. SERIOUSLY!\nAnd it's not just 1 Chipotle, they ALL do it! It's bad etiquette to put and pull a portion of a serving like that as well!\n3rd issue is the phone orders to go. OPEN ANOTHER REGISTER DUMMIES! Don't make people wait just to ring up some one who ordered via phone or however. Plus it's not a good feeling when you're the one that ordered and picking up, it stinks having to cut people off because the business is TOO CHEAP to open a 2nd register.\n4th and last but not the least important here, WHY are you charging sooo much just for Guac? Total rip offs, yet every American just pays the fee! \n\nThis place is making a KILLING for what they charge, I don't care what any one says. It's just too expensive for what you get. Plus some times the people serving can be rude, not all the time but I guess they just have those days."
3,"Beautiful Executive suite, great dining. Great experience overall. Only wish they had live jazz music nightly and a smoke-free casino section. Totally spoiled Vegas for us. Can't stay in anything less opulent now."
3,"I would probably give this more of a 3.5, but since there are no halves, I'll round up.  If you want some inexpensive mexican grub, this is definitely a place to come to.  My good friend told me that this is one of her fav mexican places back when she was in san diego and i can see why...their carne asada fries were quite tasty...my only gripe is that there weren't enough fries! the amount of carne asada totally overpowered the fries.  most people will prob think i'm crazy in wanting more fries over more carne asada but when the carne asada is considered a topping for fries, i better get a generous portion of fries.  In addition to the carne asada fries, i shared a fish burrito with my sister and that was yummy! no over flowing juice action that always happens whenever i eat burritos, where you feel sauce dripping down your hands and arms like waterfalls.  it had the right amt of liquid sauce as well as veggies and generous portions of fried fish.  As for my friend's fiance's chicken burrito, that was all chicken...so much so to the point that he said he couldn't think about eating chicken for a whole week! haha....so definitely come here to try the carne asada fries and definitely come here if you LOVE meat., otherwise, the amt of meat they give you may be a bit overwhelming."
4,"Robertos is the best mexican food around. Roger, Maria and the rest of the crew are awesome. I never leave disappointed or hungry, Robertos is a must if you are in the area. Whenever my brother comes into town from Alaska we have to stop by and get a Pastor burro before going to the house. Roger even got his address and mailed him a T-shirt."
3,"I first wen to this place with coworkers and it is crazy because I have lived down the street from this place for years!  I love Italian food and I cannot believe that I had never tried it!  I have always been a Pasta Brioni fan, but this place is just as good!  They have a great wine selection and the bread they bring you before the meal...OMG!!  It is fabulous!  Dont fill up on it too much because then you will miss out on your food!  The mussels are Fantastic...there is a little bit to them but that is what makes them so delicious!  You get to dip the bread in the sauce...and it takes it to a whole other level!  YUM YUM YUM!!  I got the pasta with the vodka sauce and the shrimp!  The sauce was creamy and smooth...I literaly licked my bowl because their sauce was so good!  The reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because the service was slow and the wait staff got several orders wrong and it took a while for our food!  I am a very patient person and I was shocked at how long the food took, but the food was so good that I had to keep it at 4 stars!  They could have been having a hard night because the restaurant was packed!  The food is most important anyway...give this place a try...it is not a large restaurant and it is a nice place for a date!"
2,"Not having a place to go for dinner on Xmas eve, we reluctantly attempted this 2-star rating restaurant. It didn't turn out to be disappointing after all. One small downside of being primed by Yelp ratings. :-)\n\nWe got steamed flounder, chestnut pumpkin chicken in hot pot, triple roast combo duck/chicken/pork intestine, and plain sauteed Chinese broccoli. The roast combo wasn't great but decent. The chicken was a nice, rich stew, with the soup a great gravy for rice.\n\nThe flounder was the best-tasting: fresh-tasting, appropriately flavored, and tenderly steamed. At least for tonight, it seemed as though only Mom's cooking was better.\n\nThe service was curt and to the point. We did get a nice, free bowl of soup made from pork bone and Chinese medicine. Very tasty.\n\nOverall, we felt the fish was a four, but other dishes dragged it down to a 3."
2,"On y va pour le cadre et l'ambiance, pas forc\u00e9ment pour le service toujours agr\u00e9able mais pas toujours performant :) Ne vous avisez pas de demander un cocktail classique mais pas \u00e0 la mode. On ne sait pas faire."
1,"Full disclosure - we lived in SoCal for the past 17 years so we haven't found really good Mex yet in the burgh. You have to pay for chips & salsa, the chips weren't salted after they were fried & no salt shaker on bar. Salsa was good, hot but not scorching. Drinks were WAY overpriced. 7.50 for a regular margarita -no mention of the tequila brand. They were tasty (but for the drab atmosphere (which is perfectly okay for a Mexican restaurant) too spendy. Beer was no better at $5 a bottle. My beef tacos were tasty but the cooked onion was wrong for the dish. Should have been raw onion with the cilantro for a street taco feel. The hub ordered the least Mexican dish, the chimichanga, and he swears it wasn't deep fried and had only steak inside. The saddest complaint was when we ordered guacamole, it was so so so obviously packaged & not even as good as Calavo. This place has potential, but I fear it will be gone in 6 months."
2,"Although it is a bit more crowded than other airports I've been to, it was a pleasant experience.\n\nThe Good:\n- Free Wifi\n- Quick and Friendly Security / TSA Agents\n\nThe Bad:\n- A bit crowded\n- Some signs should be more clear about where things are (ticketing/check ins)"
2,"I had one of the best cupcakes EVER at the other Layers location, so I was excited to have this new location closer to my work. \n\nOn my initial visit, I was disappointed when I walked in and saw very little as far as baked sweets. I ended up getting a chicken salad wrap. I personally did not care for the curried mayo, and unfortunately the sandwich can not be made without it. \n\nThe service was friendly and the portion was good sized. I found the prices a little high, over $9 for a wrap which came with a small salad that was just greens and a couple slices of strawberry (I will say that the made-in-house dressing was excellent). This did not stop me from making another visit a couple months later. \n\nOn my second visit I had the cafe croissant, which is a turkey, bacon and cheddar cheese sandwich on, you guessed it, a croissant.  This was an excellent sandwich, everything tasted fresh and the flavors complimented each other well. Again it was over $9 for the sandwich and side salad, but it was a very filling meal. \n\nI hope that Layers is someday able to expand and offer up more baked goods at this location. I can not rate a business that calls itself a 'Bakery Cafe' more than 3 stars when the multiple times I have gone in for delicious sweet baked goods have left me disappointed."
1,"Abstract: Worst service within a twenty kilometer radius. Quite possibly the worst service -- dollar for dollar -- in the whole fucking town! \n\nAs a rule I start disliking chains before I even step foot in them. Just a rule I maintain; maybe I am a hipster. \n\nAnyway, I have always felt that CJ sucked (probably because they do). And this particular location takes the cake. \n\nBe prepared for the slowest, most uninspired/lackadaisical 'service' known to humankind. This is almost so bad that one starts imagining that it is a hidden camera-'reality tv' show that one is an unknown party to. I am waiting to sign a fucking waiver at the end of my meal over here.\n\nOne starts to ask oneself: \""Is this going to be on TruTV or something? Hidden Camera-Secret Diner-Bad Bar-Restaurant Rescue-Storage crossover?\"" \n\nI mean: for fucks sake. Get your shit together!\n\nWe have all been to hole-in-the-walls where you know you ain't getting crumbs brushed off the fucking table service. But this place ... this Claim Jumper is worse than any hole-in-the-wall I have ever been to. And I have been to Mejico (real Mejico, not Cancun or whatever the fuck). I said Mejico!\n\nFood sucks; service sucks; and I feel I am surrounded by so-called Yuppies on every occasion I go there. (Could be more of a Town Square problem.)\n\nMaybe I am a hipster.

4,Outstanding customer service\nBrad is wonderful to deal with concerning our 2 cars\nHighly recommend
0,"If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.\n\nUnfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to \""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.\""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there."
0,"Can I give this place a zero star rating? Came in with the kids to get kiddie pedis & my own pedi, as well as a fill for a friend. They said they could take us all and that it wasn't a problem. One of the pedis was for my friend's young son and we asked if he could soak his feet & that's it. Next thing I know, the women were getting ignored & they're giving him a full blown pedi. A five year old does not need calluses removed!!!! Despite the fact that we didn't ask for that and in no universe would he ever need that service, we were charged for it. \nI also thought it to be an exceptional business strategy that they were trying to upsell add ons to the pedis for the girls. Since when does a 7-year old make payment decisions?!'\nThey upsell you like crazy and don't take 'no' for an answer. At one point during my pedi, she was trying so hard to get me to do a manicure that she actually told me my hands looked terrible. They will look really terrible when I scratch your eyes out. Or maybe I'll scratch mine out if I ever decide to go to this salon again."
2,"I remember that cherub of culinary commerce, that leprechaun of EVOO, Rachael Ray, came here on one her $40-a-day shows and swooned over the abundance of flowers on display here. She may have said, \""Oh, my gravy!\"" or one of her other tired expressions. For some reason, I was expecting a much bigger atrium greenhouse, but in truth, it's actually squeezed in an inner courtyard of the Bellagio surrounded by fancy restaurants and upscale shops like Chihuly.\n\nThe good news is that unlike most anything else in the hotel, the conservatory is free. Granted the ornate glass ceilings lend a European flavor, Jamie W. and I were strolling when they ironically put out their Chinese New Year's decorations with panda topiaries and a variety of orchids and other exotic flowers, all immaculately maintained (see my photos). The challenge is maneuvering yourself through the throngs of tourists with their baby strollers and shrieking toddlers. It's just not all that bucolic a setting for personal meditation if you know what I mean. How much is too much? Just go to the Bellagio and find out."
4,"Oh wow.... Yum! I'm not vegan, not even vegetarian, but I will certain be going back to la Panthere Verte.\n\nA vegan friend brought me there on a Wed night for a quick bite. The place was about half-full. We split a veggie burger and a tempehtation pita, which were ready in less than 10 min. The portions were quite generous and both were delicious, but the veggie burger was just a bit better with the pickles and ketchup. Didn't try any of the juices or smoothies, but certainly will next time.\n\nPerfect location, with the 24 bus steps away, the Guy metro just around the corner and a Bixi stand a block away.\n\nLoved the relaxed atmosphere and all the greenery."
4,"Needing a quick snack, we decided to try out Hubee D's. We shared a tenders basket and found the chicken to be fresh with a crunchy but not overly done crust. I tried each of the sauces and would have been content with any of them. The best part? THE FRIES ARE PERFECT!! Thin so they each have a good crunch - I could eat a bag of 'em! This place has the service and the food - I'll be back!"
0,"so many freaking 5 star reviews. Something is incredibly fishy.  And it stinks - I know this because I just ate there yesterday and it was NOT NOT NOT that good.\n\nI repeat it was NOT that good..\n\nAnd I'm Asian...I know Asian food and this was GROSSLY overpriced for an allegedly high end Chinese Restaruant.  \n\nI thought Blossom was 6 on a 1 to 10 scale.  On that same scale after eating at Jasmine, I would rate Blossom at a 9 and Jasmine at a 2 or 2.5 - no higher and 5 stars?  WTF are you guys smoking? Seriously. \n\n1. Trio of dumplings - BLEH.  Really $18?  Small and tasteless\n2. Corn chowder soup - no real flavor at all. $18? Yikes\n3. Salt and Pepper Lobster - this had to be one of the most disappointing dishes of all.  and for $68 bucks it stunk.  I rate it a 1.  The waitress highly recommended noodles in place of rice - how can you screw that up? Oh man you did - bland and (wait for it) terribly over cooked - there's an apparent theme going on here. \n\nEven their specialty drinks were small in size and watered down. \n\nSad.\n\nVery Very Sad and DISAPPOINTING.\n\nOnce again - beware of all these 5 star reviews.  After having eaten there I think either these people have been eating dirt for the last few years or they are fake fake fake."
2,"The place is huge and empty.  So I ordered 5 chocolates to go for 10$.  It is actually cheap as I buy chocolate all the time for much more (Godiva, Grandbois and Laura Secord just to name a few)\n\nMy main concern is about presentation and it was weak.  By the time I got home everything looked like a mess, That is 1 block away.  Why not like everybody else in the chocolate business have dividers so when you open that box you are happy with what you see and then start tasting each of the gems you just purchased\n\nMaybe charge a bit more and make sure the presentation is there.  \n\nFriendly, hipster staff, quick service.  Acceptable since it is 5 minutes walk from my home.  I would not sit there as it feels too big and lonely.  I can buy on my way to work a  much much better overall experience\n\nGood luck!"
3,"If I worked uptown, this would definitely be a go-to for an inexpensive, healthy meal. This is a Chipotle-style eatery where you pick your basic protein-and-carbs delivery device (salad, wrap, sandwich) and then shuffle down the line picking your various toppings and dressings. Energy Caf\u00e9 has fairly fresh ingredients and tasty dressings.\n\nThe best thing about this place, however, is the service and the people. Everyone is very friendly and willing to take the extra step to make sure you enjoy your meal and dining experience. \n\nI definitely recommend Energy Caf\u00e9 for a workweek lunch."
3,"I enjoy this place when I'm craving Korean type food in my neighborhood instead of driving to Chinatown area.  The menu has since changed since we've been there a few months back. We always enjoy the complimentary wonton cinnamon strips.  My children enjoyed the spam musubi. As I mentioned in my tip, spam musbi was tasty but they add daikon to it which my daughter picked out.  My younger daughter is allergic to soy.  The server was very accommodating to her allergies and separated her plate from the soy!  The bento box was a perfect serving and very tasty! The bulgogi sandwich was soggy after a while as the juices wet the bun too much.  They need to serve it on another type of bread. My husband has the garlic squid and steamed egg.  He enjoyed both although he was expecting to taste the garlic more in the squid dish.  \n\nI always enjoy the food here.  Whenever I go here its never that busy.  I hope it remains open for a long time!"
2,"This is simple the food is awesome. The service is kinds lousy and for that -2. Every time I go I see my self getting almost the same thing(carne asada burrito add cheese) unless hungover I get menudo.(very seldom) but every time they forget that cheese I am all like I paid for it, so I want it. The food is awesome. :)"
4,"I tried this place about a month after the grand opening. Its a sister company that Sushi mon owns, I think, anyhow the place is beautiful and servers were ready to serve. All you can eat style, sushi was fresh & hella tasty, sushi chefs were speedy but precise , servers were good in keeping up with orders and maintaing a clean table. Another real good sushi joint to try."
4,"My very jaded parents were in town and honestly they've seen nearly every major show on the Vegas strip (Love, Jersey Boys, Mystere, O, Phantom, etc, etc) and were looking for a \""unique\"" show. I nervously booked this puppet show based purely on yelp reviews!\n\nNone of us had ever seen America's got Talent or really heard much about this guy. The whole puppet thing looked pretty hokey to me, and I was pretty nervous about convincing my parents to drop $80/ticket on this guy! We were absolutely blown away. He's one of the most talented performers I've ever seen. He has a great voice with or without his mouth closed. It was funny and moved very quickly. It has great \""mass appeal\"" if you will. I'd recommend it to nearly anyone.. it's such a great show. \n\nThanks yelp!"
3,"Mandy's is really delicious. They're not skimpy on the delicious items in every bite. It's very yummy but way, way too expensive."
3,"By far the best condo complex in the Old Town area.  Great architecture and landscaping make this an oasis between Rancho Vista and Highland off of Scottsdale Rd.  They have a great area underground including raquetball and basketball courts, an indoor pool and jacuzzi, and steam rooms.  An on-site restaurant, cafe and market round out this place. If you ever get down to the parking garages, it's an Audi/BMW/Rolls Royce/Mercedes/Range Rover dealership in a sense.  Everyone here drives a nice car.\n\nYes, it's expensive.  Yes, you have floor to ceiling windows so you have to understand people can sometimes see you.  Yes, these are condos, so you can sometimes hear neighbors (I rarely have).  \n\nOverall, hands down the best non-maintenance place to live in all of Scottsdale."
1,"My son and I are split on this one. As a vegetarian, I was not impressed with the selection.  In fact, found only one entree-type item that didn't have meat of some kind. It was basically a vegetable burrito. Unfortunately, none of the vegetables inside were cut into pieces that could be eaten without taking out of the burrito and cutting separately. Seemed to me that the whole thing was thrown together without much concern for whether or not the customer would have to take it apart to eat it.\n\nMy son on the other hand had the spicy chicken wrap. He said it packed a good deal of spice and was extremely flavorful. For my money, there are better places than this for Med food - Pita Jungle down the street, for example. Better vegetarian selections as well."
0,"Slow service the food um just low ok. If you are going to Teriyaki please don't. Chicken, Beef , sauce really just stop not Teriyaki this only gives Teriyaki a bad name and if no one think so go to seattle and try there teriyaki you will say holly Shi!!!!. Sorry only want good food not bad. And if you think this is good than your adventures haven't taken you far or tast buds are shot."
4,"Loved it!  For an AYCE sushi place, the menu is extensive.  We especially enjoyed the Grilled Pork Belly, Scallop sushi and Sweet Shrimp sushi.  They added the shrimp head to our miso shiru so it had a wonderful flavor."
3,"Tr\u00e8s bon restaurant de sushis de quartier, o\u00f9 la nourriture est bien faite, les recettes maisons ing\u00e9nieuses, l'ambiance charmante et le service sympathique.

4,"OK I surrender.  I was frankly expecting some slip up by this restaurant and would you believe it, it was all five stars through and through\n\nFOOD: I had the mussels marinara, others, the pescatore linguine, the chicken piccata, and the eggplant parmigiana  All four shared cheesecake with raspberries and chocolate.  (BTW, Gaspar's wife made the cheesecake that very afternoon)FANTASTIC!\n\nWAITSTAFF: Nikita (our server) was helpful, swift, cheery, and at the end nicely talkative, making our experience GREAT!\n\nAMBIANCE: it started a little off putting, but once inside it was like a fine restaurant in Italy - even though next to a used car lot and on a busy street.  The decor was charming.  Admittedly it was a loud restaurant, but what restaurant isn't?  We loved it.\n\nPRICES: the expectation was a really expensive place with all of the publicity it has received.  Not true.  Our foursome's bill, even with a 20% tip was around $100.  Not bad.  \n\nI can't think of any reason to give less than a 5 star rating\n\nIn addition, the owner (Gaspar) personally met us at the door when we left and wished us well and to come back.  Indeed we will"
1,"It started out promising enough.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated promptly.  Reviewing the menu, many of the dishes looked good.  Our waitress seemed nice (despite the really long red sparkly fingernails - maybe not appropriate for food service?) - she brought water and took our order.  Then things went sideways...\n\nWhat we ordered:  Eggs Benedict with well-done hash browns, and the Arizona Burrito.  \n\nWhat we received:  Barely warm undercooked hash browns and poached eggs that were left sitting too long - the yolks were rock hard!  How long did those poor things sit before being served?  Ick.  The Arizona Burrito was supposed to contain eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes & cheese.  While it was large and impressive to look at on the plate, where was the meat?  A few paltry pieces could be identified amidst the egg/potato filling.\n\nI would have liked to be able to ask to have my hash browns cooked a bit longer, or for my eggs to be cooked correctly, but our waitress DISAPPEARED.  Gone.  Where did she go?  Busy staff came and went (walking right by empty water glasses time and time again), but she was nowhere to be found.  She never came back to check on us, refill water or even give us our bill.  Another waitress passing by took pity on us, and went to find someone to bring our check.\n\nBreakfast is supposed to be a good start to the day, not an exercise in frustration.\n\nOne more note - please remove the Christmas decor - it is the end of January."
1,"This is a very large location with plenty of tv screens to show the latest sporting event which was nice.  The family and I have been here twice so far and had fair experiences both times.  Service has been good; however, the food is not as good as I would expect a typical bar and grill would be.  I ordered the French Dip my first time and a Bistro Burger the second time.  The fries that come with the meal was nothing special and both sandwiches were on the bland side, again, nothing special.  I had a craft brew on my first occasion and that was enjoyable.  I think this would be a good place for friends to meet up to watch a sporting event and maybe order a couple of appetizers.  The food doesn't make me want to return with the family."
1,"I love their bagels, they always taste good.  I don't know a single person that doesn't love their bagels and cream cheese.  The place is always clean also, the prices are a little high, but it's not so high that it's stopping me from going.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is one of the girls that works there.  She's just awkward towards me every time I go in there and rude.  She can service 5 people before me, and then walk away when it comes to me and tells me to wait.  Even when it's dead and there is only two people in the whole building, she'll service the people before me and walk away for minutes ignoring me. \n\nLast time I was in there she serviced everyone before me, and then walked away and I heard her ask a coworker to take my order, make it, and ring me up.  I'm way to old to know this girl, there's no way we went to high school together, I'm 100% I am NEVER rude to staff anywhere I go cause I've been in there shoes at some point before (work wise).  And I've ignored her little attitude for months now, but it's getting old, and I think I just might be willing to start driving the extra miles to a different location where I don't have to put up with this anymore.\n\nAnd it's not just her attitude towards me, I've seen her be rude to her coworkers before.  Snapping at them acting like she's the only one working and she feels everyone else is lazy.  It's an appetite killer to be treated poorly, and it's an appetite killer to watch someone treat their coworkers like dirt too."
3,"Jason's Deli is great!\n\nThey have a fantastic menu with food that will keep you begging for more, actually, with the size of the sandwiches that are here, you will make yourself sick if you get more. In addition to the sandwiches, Jason's Deli has a plethora of good drinks and salad bar accessories. In addition, they have a soft-serve ice cream machine, which is free when you get the salad bar. \n\nDefinitely a borderline 5 star restaurant, but the one major thing that holds me at 4 is the fact that they do not have sourdough bread (my favorite). I think sourdough is a pretty common type of bread and I don't think carrying sourdough bread is not a whole lot to ask from a deli of all places."
3,"Target stores seem to be very similar in layout, product placement and obviously, pricing--so the differences between them do not usually stand out to me. This store is in a great location. For the most part, the staff seems helpful although the general attitude seems to have diminished in recent years. Their lane management also does not seem to be on par with what it used to be as there is usually a wait. However, overall I like this store. I can say with confidence that I will seek out a Target before succumbing to the dark side of Wal-Mart."
2,"This Taco Bell takes so long, it's not the best place to go for munchies because you'll be sober by the time you get your food. \n\n1:00 AM, only car in the drive through on a Wednesday night/ Thursday morning. 5 minutes to get our food. We didn't check it there (our bad) but we got home to find out we were given the wrong item despite having the order repeated back correctly. I'm not sure how this happened as there literally no one else in the drive thru and dining room closed. \n\nThey do have a happy hour from 2pm-5pm with $1 loaded grillers and drinks, so I would be willing to deal with the wait for that deal, as long as my food was correct. \n\nThe drive thru is a really tight turn in if you're coming from the right, it's almost easier to circle through the parking lot so you're turning left into the drive thru."
0,"Please go here if you want a rude front desk clerk, have them tell you to REPACK your stuff IN THEIR BOXES as you obviously are too stupid to do it yourself and then have them charge you enough to ship it all over again.  RUDE.  Never going here again.  Hispanic short heavy set woman at front counter is a waste of $9.00 an hour.\n\nWish her the best at Mcdonalds.  UPS for me consider me a fed-EX.\n\nOh just read another review with same issue.  Me thinks there may be a THEME. RUN TO UPS or at least another FEDEX store."
4,I love this place!!! I was desperate to find a dress and I didn't have much time and a limited budget. These 2 made it happen. They were so friendly and helpful. If it wasn't for this store I don't know what I would have done!
1,"We ordered the chicken katsu and the loco moco for dinner.  First of all, the chicken katsu was cold and you can tell it was not fresh at all.  It tasted like it was just heated up in the microwave and not fried like it should have been.  The loco moco is not nearly as good as L & L's.  I will never come back here again!!"
3,"We recently moved down the street from here and were pleasantly surprised by this little place.  Though the food portions could be considered small (come on people, we as a country could stand to lessen our portions a bit!) I find them to be enough.  The carne asada is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had.  The margarita's are really yummy and the fact that they are on tap makes me love them even more.  The horchata is also note worthy and if you want, they'll even add some booze to it for a small up-charge.  Hey-o!"
1,Recently I had a slow leak on my front tire. The place I bought the original tire was a distance from my house so quickly stopped into Pahl Tire as it was near by. The technician did a very good job and found the source of the issue. In the end they had to put on the spare tire as my original tire was bad. It was initially flat when they put it on. They pumped it up and I asked if it would stay inflated. They said they were sure it would as they rushed me out the door as it was closing time. When I got home less than 2 miles away the tire was flat. While I appreciate the service of the technician and his attention to my car initially I am disappointed that they let me go with a tire that was flat and did not verify the spare was good. Now I have to have my car towed to get a tire put on my spare. Very frustrating. I did not really care for the Manager. When I mentioned to him where I bought the original tire he made some negative comments about the place and guys. I just think that is something you don't do. Say bad things about your competitors. I plan on going back to the original tire place where I was very satisfied in the first place. I won't go back to Pahl.
2,Great concept. A little pricey for this type of  restaurant. Service not great. Would go back again not sure how long they are open may improve with time.\nFood had mixed reviews at our table
4,This was a specular experience for me.  No 3 inches of snow on the ground or frigid wind was going to come between me and my bowl of steamy hot Ramen. I credit my boyfriend with the idea to try Ramen Bar and it was well worth the two buses and tramping through the dirty sludge to get there. \n\nRamen has been a dish I was curious about for so long one that I have seen my favorite TV personality Anthony Bourdain enjoy. I had the Tom Yam Men I made this choice because I saw in the menu description that it was Thailand inspired hot and sour broth.  I added egg and shrimp.   The shrimp was plentiful in the dish however I found myself wanting more mushrooms and the egg was hard boiled I had been hoping for a poached egg one with a runny yoke. \nThe service was very friendly and the other dining guests there were of various ethnic backgrounds.  Ramen Bar is an A + in my book.
0,"So places that sell subs sometimes do salads and I stopped in for this.  This place is close to my new place and I'd never been before so I decided to check it out after work one evening.  I asked if they did salads and the worker told me they could make any sub into a salad.  I chose the chicken teriyaki and was shocked when I got home and opened the box.  They literally cooked chicken, cheese and mushrooms on the grill like they would for a sandwich and put it on top of chopped iceberg lettuce! Yuck! I will never go back! Gross, I had to throw it away."
4,"My 2nd visit to Paymon's was even better than the first, thus the coveted 5th star has been added.\n\nIt was a late night visit and I needed a pick me up, so I ordered the Turkish coffee ... Thick, strong, and a fabulous energizer. Turkish coffee kicks Red Bull's perky little ass!  \n\nService was friendly, attentive and prompt. For the hookah, we really enjoyed the blueberry blend this time around. We ordered their awesome fries again (man, that dip is goooood) and they rocked as hard as ever.\n\nCheck it out for the very cool atmosphere, super service, yummy nom noms, and the killer Turkish coffee that will keep you boppin' til dawn."
3,"If you're the type of person to complain about a venue being soulless, characterless, or lacking in atmosphere, then one would think you would know not to come to an out of town leisure complex. Soullessness is a requirement of such complexes, and in some ways is a benefit if you're looking for an evening out but can't face the thought of using your brain or imagination.\n\nCinema, chain restaurants, bowling, casino. It's all here, and all perfectly dull and acceptable."
0,"Horrible food.  I hate to rag this place but...\n\nThe sushi is \""mall-quality.\""  It's not horrible, but it's just C-level fish.\n\nThe huge problem is the teppanyaki...just awful.  I ate there over the Christmas holidays.  I love this style of cooking and it's kinda hard to screw it up.  Here's how Kabuto managed:\n\n-  The chicken was so salty it was inedible.  I ate 3 bites and had a headache for the rest of the evening (and I like a lot of salt and seasoning).\n\n-  I also had a problem that neither the cook or the server questioned if there was a problem with the food since I hardly touched my chicken.  They probably didn't notice since...\n\n-  The cook just GLOPS piles of noodles and rice on your plate (and on the table) like he was slopping hogs!  Only a 3 year old could be comfortable eating here.  Just crap.\n\n-  I didn't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there.  If not for this, I'd have talked to the manager.  The food was awful and the presentation was worse.\n\n-  Our cook even screwed up the \""onion volcano\""...first time I've ever seen this botched.\n\n-  Kabutos wasn't always bad.  I used to eat there every few months back in the 90's (before I moved away).  It's really gone downhill.  They now serve mostly rice and (now) noodles, and only a few bites of vegetables...all of which are completely over-seasoned.  I honestly think the cook just doesn't know any better."
3,"I ate here a couple of times for breakfast on vacation and really liked  it both times. The interior is a lot like  an off-the-center of the city Parisian bistro. I have no way of knowing that, of course, since I've never been to France, but trust me. I'm right on the money with this. It's got a really nice inside part. And the outside part is awfully nice if it's not 110 degrees out. \n\n    The food is exceptional and reasonable for the Strip. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and they were freakin' awesome. The homemade engrish muff, the hollandaise, hell, even the hash browns were spot on and don't usually like hash browns. Good! Throw in a mimosa and you've got yerself a nice breakfast. \n     The other time I had muesli with fresh berries. Again, really good. \n   I've seen a few refer to this as a tourist trap, but I didn't get that vibe at all. Give it a shot."
4,"I have a total of 5 pups, some more challenging than others.  I usually groom the pups myself but had slacked off because of my schedule and I wasn't up for the wrestling match.  A friend of mine treated me to the grooming session with Kay and Allie.  Although I was initially apprehensive about the stress level of the pups since I've been their groomer for so long, I have to say that it was an exceptional experience all the way around.  I handed them off and waited to see who would win the wrestling match.  Coming back into the house, I sat on the sofa and looked at the brochure Kay had given me before the hand-off.  Among the list of included treatments was a blueberry facial.  I couldn't help but laugh.   I was pretty sure this wasn't going to be an average experience.  I was right.  There's nothing average about Kay and her crew.  Not only did the pups come back looking perfect and smelling wonderful, but if they could talk I was pretty sure they'd thank me for the spa day.  Rocco, who is Mr. Picky when it comes to treats, devoured the cookie the girls gave me, only after asking permission if it was ok.  Rocco and Oddie were happy. . . and the fact that Rocco looked forward to his cookie after grooming was 100% proof positive that these are professionals with a compassionate touch that animals recognize and trust. I've got to find out what those cookies are. . .My grooming days are over.  Thank you Kay and Allie."
4,I think they have great coffee and pastries.  There hasn't been a time I visited that I wasn't happy with the results.
4,"Really good - I gave them barely 48 hours notice for two dozen cupcakes and they responded very quickly by email. Called me the next day to confirm payment information, and by 10 am the next day the cupcakes were delivered to our hotel.\n\nThe cakes themselves were beautifully presented and very tasty. The inside is quite gooey so it's a good idea to provide napkins! I had the Mojito and the Bailey's flavours and they are delicious.\n\nMy only slight quibble is that the pink cupcake pans used sometimes give you sticky pink fingers (they're not 'colourfast' I guess). Overall a very stres-free and professional experience! I wish they had a shopfront where I could try some more flavours :)"
1,I went here for lunch and thought it was going to be amazing . The lighting was SO bright it made you dizzy . The burgers had barely and meat and the shake was not what I expected I ordered the cookies and cream and the oreo was just on the top the rest was just vanilla ice cream . Not impressed
4,I took my teenage daughter for a haircut today at Hair Pollution.  She is thrilled with her cut and could not have been happier.  WayCool aka Hair Pollution is an awesome shop.  We researched other salons before choosing this one and I am so glad we went there.  So many salons are about promoting themselves and who and what they know.  This salon is about getting the job done without all the fluff.  Chris did an amazing job and took a ton of time perfecting her cut.  The salon has a cool artsy vibe that doesn't usually exist in Phoenix.  We will definitely return again in the future.
1,"So this review is based solely on the chinese food and not the donuts. \n\nI wouldn't say this was bad, although I definitely wouldn't say it was good either. We had the sweet and sour pork with fried rice and the sesame chicken. Pretty basic stuff for a chinese restaurant.\nI'm not saying these are \""healthy\"" items, but typical of most chinese restaurants in this city its just too oily, and the flavors were fairly bland.\n\nThe prices are on par with what cheap chinese food should be, and of the 3 items the sesame chicken was the best.\n\nThe donuts look fairly decent and next time I'll probably give them a shot with some original options, but I definitely won't be back for the chinese food."
2,"I had some kind of grilled chicken sandwich with arugula on fococcia bread. It seemed bland. If I went back, I'd try a burger or rueben. Atmosphere and service were good, though."
0,RUDE!!!!! this guy never showed up for our appointment!!! Seriously how can he be such a badddd businessman...not even a callback to me to apologize nor did he call the receptionist back! Won't b getting my business nor my 50 friends I always refer! Glad u didnt get my awesome tip: YOU SUCK DOUCHBAG !!!!!!
0,"I wanted their Maine lobster roll, but they run out so I decided to try the popcorn shrimp ($9.99). All I can say, Popeye's popcorn shrimp taste  better to me."
1,"I think for the average person I would give it 4  stars but for the reasons stated below it dropped significantly!  If I cannot be safe then what's the point?  First off a yelp check in offer appears for this restaurant stating a deal on gluten free toast.  According to the Manager they don't advertise with yelp and think that yelp is a rip off because if you don't advertise with them then you get less stars...so that is why she'd never advertise with yelp. So I don't know why that comes up on my phone app.\n\nI am a celiac so it is dangerous for my health if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, etc.)  This restaurant offers gluten free toast and pancakes.  Most people would assume that since they offer these choices then they would follow cross contamination guidelines and know how to prepare food to keep people with Celiac safe.\n\nThis is not the case. Yesterday, I had an excellent waitress.  I asked her point blank if the gluten free toast (which is more expensive) was toasted in a dedicated toaster.  She said that yes, it was toasted.  I then said again specifically, \""So you have a toaster JUST for the gluten free toast?  And you are using separate utensils and butter?\""  She looked at me like I was speaking Russian (and that is NEVER a good sign when addressing these issues.)\n\nShe stated, it's toasted in the big toaster we use for the toast.  AH!  So then I asked if they prepare the gluten free pancakes on the same griddle as the regular ones and prep those in the same area as well.  And the answer (that I figured was coming) was yes.  No, there is no other prep area in the back for keeping gluten free items apart.  No cross contamination education imparted.  She didn't even understand that there needed to be any procedures followed. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong, this was a very nice waitperson.  She was very concerned when I was asking her these questions.  I asked her if she could make sure that someone with clean hands (not having touched regular items) could get me my slices of gf bread and just put them on my plate and not toast it?  And she did that for me herself!\n\nPretty soon the Manager came over to follow up on the gf toast issue.  I asked her again if they had training and separated areas for the gf products and she said that they did not.  I asked her why they didn't if they were offering gluten free toast and pancakes.  I told her that I get sick when the toast is made in the same toaster from the other bread crumbs being on my gf toast.  That I had eaten it there before and now understood why I had been sick!\n\nHer answer (I kid you not!) was that people with Celiac Disease should just KNOW that a restaurant like theirs wouldn't follow protocols or that a person should ASK how they were prepared.   They just offered gluten free items for people restricting gluten from their diet for lifestyle.\n\nREALLY?  Advertising something gluten free and charging significantly higher prices for it do NOT get you access to the safety of training your employees?  NOT stating that on your menu?  I now KNOW that she knows there is a difference since she said that she expects Celiac's to know they won't follow safety precautions!\n\nI told her that I think that she is endangering people's health and that her answers were not acceptable.  Her entire explanation was that I couldn't possibly hold her responsible for my issues if I didn't explicitely state my needs to her so they could tell me their gf foods are unsafe for me to consume.\n\nI won't be back!  But if you don't have gluten or other dietary issues.....go ahead on!"
1,"Not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars.  I gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere.  I live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular Mexican place was closed, salsa cabana. \n\nI had the chicken chimi with rice and beans. It was ok, could have been better, temp of food was warm not hot.  Wife had the veggie burrito.  This was a bean burro with lettuce?  The rice and beans were bland.  This place is not for me, I like my Mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell. Wait I would have gave taco bell 3 stars because it's fast food Mexican and I know what to expect there.  \n\nWe had to buy chips and salsa, really?  Every Mexican food restaurant gives you this. For me this is why I go to get Mexican food."
3,Edit: \nUpgraded from one star to 4 and removed my scathing review with a long and boring problem. In the end the manager Chris called me back and talked to me to make it right. It is nice to see a business take the time to fix a customers problem. I still prefer my membership at Clean Freak car wash but in a pinch this place will do nicely.
4,"These guys are great. Knowledgable, honest, and great prices. Smokes Leslie's all day every day. Look forward to working with them again."
0,"Terrible service.I have had problems everytime I come here, first time, they overcharged me (didn't find out until I looked at my bank statement, they charged more tip then I wrote down) second time they overcharged my drink, there is a difference when I actually say 'happy hour drink' and they still charge me full price.I will not be returning."
3,"Great food, great service, great margaritas ... what else do you need in a Mexican restaurant. The Chips and Salsa were fresh and arrived quickly as did our drinks and food.\n\nJust moved to the area and will be returning!"
1,"Oh Dumplings! is Montreal's newest dumpling venue attempting to wrestle the top spot from Mai Xiang Yuan. \n\nRather large and situated in a fairly good location right on Clark, the decor is new and even decent with a pseudo open kitchen and big windows letting in tons of light.  Everything seemed pretty clean, but that could have just been the fact that it is new. Only time will tell.\n\nIt appears as though they've given some thought to marketing and branding.  They already have a website and according to the QR codes and Icons plastered on the front door they are all over the Web 2.0 sites including Yelp. Sadly with a quick review of their menu it's apparent that their marketing budget didn't include a spell checker.  They could have gotten a bit more creative with the food photos. From the outside dumplings look more or less the same, so the single isolated dumplings seemed a bit silly to me.\n\nA nice try I suppose with all the marketing collateral, but restaurant's need to also consider service and of course the food.  Other reviewers seemed to have problems with the service, but I found it OK.  Granted we were the only customers at the time. By the end of the meal I could have used more water but all in all that's about par for the course in Montreal.\n\nFinally, on to the food. When I glanced at the prices I seriously considered walking out and just going to Mai Xiang Yuan.  Expect to pay two or three dollars more per dish than the aforementioned restaurant.  Others mentioned the rather thick skin on the dumplings and yeah they are some thick skins.  I've eaten a lot of dumplings both here and in China and never have I had dumplings with such thick skin.  \n\nTo their credit, each dumpling was absolutely stuffed with filling.  It was a sickeningly sweet filling unfortunately.  I can only guess that they've made the filling a bit sweet in an attempt to cater to Western palates, but it sort of ruined them for me. Tellingly I actually left a couple dumplings on the plate, I just couldn't stomach any more dough or sweet filling.\n\nClearly somebody poured a bucket load of money into establishing a brand. Unfortunately they spent way too much time fiddling with the marketing and not nearly enough time nailing down the food.  Hands down Mai Xiang Yuan has better dumplings at better prices. Oh Dumplings! has a lot of work to do if they want to be a serious contender in the Montreal dumpling wars."
4,"Tacos & Beer had an awesome Groupon for chips & guacamole, two sides, and six tacos. I went to try it out for the first time with my boyfriend, and it was more than enough food. \n\nI enjoyed the guacamole and chips as a starter. The guac had a nice hint of lime, and the server was really great at refilling our chips. I ordered the shrimp, baja fish, and al pastor tacos. The seafood tacos were flavorful, and my boyfriend, who doesn't fancy seafood much, helped me finish my baja taco. I loved that the al pastor had pineapple chunks it. The only little downside was that it was a little saucy for my liking. \n\nOverall, the food was amazing, the portions were great, and the service was on point. I definitely will be coming back again, and I'm looking forward to checking out the happy hour specials!"
1,"This is a really basic place with a fairly large menu.  They serve breakfast, burgers and sandwiches, and I think most people could find something to eat on the menu.  I ordered the cheese steak and it was very good. And just so cheesesteak purists know, it came with your choice of cheese (rather than cheese whiz), with peppers, onions, and mushrooms, on a crusty sandwich bun. \n Our waitress was exceptonally rude. I actually thought it was quite fun. One of the people I was with asked for mayonaisse and she threw the packets onto the table, scattering them all over my place.  She also discouraged questions about the menu, and I thought she was going to lose it at one point, though there was only one other table during lunch time on a Friday. They have a lunch special that offers your choice of an entree with a drink and fries for $6.00.  I asked for no fries, so the waitress charged me $0.50 extra, presumably since it wasn't *really* the special.  Instead of questioning the logic behind this, I took the $0.50 out of her tip. \nAt the end of our meal, the cook (and maybe the owner?) came over to say hello and to thank us for coming in, which was nice of him, though he kept looking down my shirt.  So maybe it wasn't so nice of him. Another plus is that they serve both Coke and Pepsi products.  There really is something for everyone here, and I'd probably go again for breakfast. In a turtle neck. And only if I was in a decent mood."
0,"First of all- we had to argue with the manager about the ad on their website for $10 all you can drink Mimosas until 3pm- the waiter said \""oh that's not during the Winter.\"" Well your website doesn't say that at all. Then the manager said \""oh that's for the Lake Norman location.\"" Well NO- the website says it's at the Charlotte location. Plus we got there at 2:15ish and began asking about the special then the manager said it was until 2:30 which by this time it was 2:30 and on top of all that he was terribly RUDE.\nWe ended up getting the watered down Mimosas for #10. But this place is NOT where you want to spend your hard earned money- he didn't appreciate our business at all! \n\nI DONT RECOMMEND FIREWATER. \n\nFood was Mediocre."
1,"Yikes. \n\nI remember a couple years back when I was moving, and took in a bag full of clothes...and got a measly $15. And included in that bag-o-clothes was some nice stuff! Like a $200 (barely-used) coat. I was shocked, but took the cash and ran.\n\nBut today, all I needed was the cheapest t-shirt they had. I forgot my gym shirt and just needed something to get me by. I struggled to find a t-shirt under $9. These are ratty, used t-shirts we are talking about. I found a terrible green shirt for $5 and got the heck out.\n\nOh, and the staff? Terrible. I've worked retail before, so I get it. Retail sucks. But at least fake it. The two young women in there today were rude and looked uncomfortable. \n\nFor men's clothing, your options are limited. The prices are also too high. There seems to be a great selection of women's clothing, but I reckon the prices are still a bit high."
4,"The most delicious lox I ever tasted, and the bagel tasted like they made it after I walked in the door. Delicious! Wish they had a Facebook page."
3,"all suite hotel\nvery  \""W\"" type\nParking lot right in front of lobby\nno casino"
4,"I love their full-service car wash.  You can get everything done here, and I think I'll start to.\n\nI got both of my cars washed the other night, and they did an awesome job.  You go through the car wash to get the outside sparkling clean, and then they do the inside while you get to shop inside.  I took my kid inside to get the all-important icee and had time to check-in too.  I'm going to use my check-in special for next time.\n\nThey also do oil changes there, so I think I'll go.  You can really make a day of it at this place, and there's a lot of great shopping nearby to keep you busy while they work on your vehicle."
0,"I will never be visiting this place again.\n\nSNOBBY EMPLOYEES\nOVERPRICED\nMEDIOCRE FOOD\nMINIMAL DRINK SELECTIONS\n\n\nHands down the worst beer selection and drink pricing I have seen in downtown Phoenix. Two of their beers that were supposed to be on tap were out. They were out of iced tea. The frier was not working.\n\nI visited here with a group of friends so I did not cause a scene because I wanted us to have a good evening. But honestly, when my girlfriend and I asked for more chips when the small amount we were given with our guacamole appetizer ran out - 1st, the waitress forgot about it - 2nd, when i asked her about it again she said ok, then came back and said that it would be the price of another appetizer to get more chips.\n\nAre you kidding me? Really? Tortilla chips are costing your shag business $9.00 to refill? \n\nOn top of the mediorce beer selection, another friend in our group ordered a cocktail and stated that it was not strong at all and even felt watered down. Reading other reviews, I see that other people have felt the same way.\n\nThe waitress was the snobbiest thing I've ever seen. I'm not one to put up with that when I go out to eat because I don't go to restaurants on the top of Camelback Mountain. You would've thought little miss thing was working at the Ritz Carlton. She was rude, unhelpful and deserved less than a 10% tip.\n\nWhich brings me to my next issue with this extablishment. They automatically grat 20% for parties of 6 or more. that is a VERY LOW number on a party. Most restaurants do automatic grat on parties of 8 or more, and it is usually 18%.\n\nIf you visit this business, expect to not be informed of what they DON'T have until you try to order it. You will receive mediocre bar food for insanely expensive prices. You will not get the drink you want and if you somehow do, it won't be what you expected. You will leave feeling robbed, cheated and wishing you went somewhere else."
2,"This place was pretty cool.  They had a nice little dance floor, a decent bar (a bit pricey for the feel), a Dave n Busters style game area, and a bowling alley right next to it.  From an out of towners perspective, it was a fun time.  BTW, if you want to drink and park, the parking attendant downstairs leaves at 4ish and doesnt return till later.  So just a hint.  You have time to sober up and then not pay ANY parking fees.  I had a hotel, but yeah....oh they had these circus dancing chicks....like go go dancers but hanging from a ceiling."
2,"We loved almost everything about the Wynn.\n\nThe rooms, the baths, the room technology, the service, the beds, the restaurants (pricey but good), the decor (amazing!!!!), the casino, the stores (! the stores! Penhaligon at Apothecary...I hadn't found it in the US and always have to order online). Beautiful place and we got put on the 60th floor with a stunning view.\n\nHowEVER. Our stay was seriously marred by a bunch of really young kids in the hot tub at the pool. We mentioned something to the lifeguard, who followed us to the hot tub, looked at the large group of 7-10 year olds in the hot tub, and walked away. About a minute after she \""took care of the situation\""?  One of the kids started doing snot shots in the hot tub. \n\nYes, really, a 10 year old doing snot shots in the hot tub at the Wynn. It would have been funny if we hadn't been IN THE TUB at the time."
3,"I like this place. My friends and I have off-and-on frequented this place for the past year and we've never been disappointed. While they'll continue to truck their staple brews up from the Bisbee location, they are finally brewing small batches here in Tempe.\n\nOnly a couple blocks down from the always busy Mill, Dave's Electric is a nice change of pace with a chill patio, never overly crowded (if you're day drinking, you might be one of only a few people here) and the waitstaff are pretty awesome!\n\nMy favorite beer is the OK Ale and the pretzel bites are good little snackers."
3,A great coffee house. The muffins are awesome and my personal favorite is the choc chip. The baristas are friendly and efficient . So much better than sbuks in every way
4,"Great Food - Great Service - every time I come here the employees are fantastic- they always get my order correct and the food is FRESH. It is a  good old fashion \""SUB SANDWICH\"" -   Employes are very helpful too-"
1,"We did not eat at the Road Kill Grill instead we Came here to pick up my 5 bone standing rib roast. It was good, but it wasn't great. Didn't have any more flavor or tenderness than a supermarket brand and it was expensive."
2,"*sigh*\n\n2 Items I really liked... the sizes for one were XS and S. Out of 30 peices.\n\nThe other were XXL and XL ....\n\nI settled on a different color. A great deal, but sheesh."
0,"After reading the reviews here and a few local papers claiming this as the #1 breakfast place, we decided to give it a shot. If this is the best Charlotte has to offer for breakfast out, we'll stay home.\n\nThey were very crowded, but we didn't have to wait long at all for our table. The waitress was attentive and friendly. I do agree with other reviewers who've said the decor could use some freshening but that's not a deal breaker for me.\n\nWhat made us decide this is not a place we'd return to was the food itself. I ordered the chiabata french toast with bacon and grits, while he ordered the Italian Omelet Brunch Special (3 egg omelet with mushrooms, sausage, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce) with hashbrown and cheese grits. \n\nMy bread was soggy in the middle, and the texture felt like the bread had soaked up too much egg and not been thoroughly cooked thru. The bacon was rubbery, and the grits were tasteless and seemed slightly undercooked. \n\nHis hash browns were soggy and greasy, while the omelet was watery and rather bland. His cheese grits suffered the same undercooked texture as my plain ones, and while they had an orangey color to them, had no cheese flavor at all.\n\nWe hold out hopes of finding a good breakfast place someday, but for us, Eddie's is just not it."
3,"I visit one of the YC's locations almost every month. The process of picking your own ingredients and sauces, having them grilled for you, and the ultra fresh taste of food just cooked is unique. An amazing value at about $10! Their hot mustard sauce is spot on."
1,"A long line at an Einstein is to be expected on a Saturday morning.  But a more than 15 wait for two toasted bagels with smear is not.  That, by the way, was after a five minute wait just to order and pay.  I know that the biggest part of this issue is that a chain like Einstein has set ways of doing things, but it would've been nice to see some of the workers have a little more urgency to get food out.  It was so backed up that there was barely a place to stand and wait at 8:00am.  I don't even want to know what it may have looked like at 9:00 or 10:00."
0,"I have heard their commercials on the radio for some time so decided to try Zerorez. Upon making my reservation I was not informed of a $5.00 per stair fee.  As I have a tri-story home with 48 stairs this would amount to a fair amount of money. \n \nThe technician informed me of the fee upon arrival and said he was sorry that I had not been informed but I could pay or he would leave.  I decided to have my downstairs cleaned so I could see if there is any difference from my original service.  \n \nI stayed out of the tech's way so he could do his job.  However, the three times I came to check on him he was on his cell phone but promptly got off when he saw me.  \n \nUpon completion I completed the customer service form via email stating that I was not impressed and felt like it was a 'bait and switch' scam as I was not informed about the fee for stairs.  Two days later I received a call from a young lady in customer service.  After discussing the situation she stated she would pull the tapes of my initial conversation when I made the reservation and call me back.  This was approximately 3 months ago... I've yet to receive a call. \n \nOverall, I don't believe my carpet is any cleaner than when I've used my original company and their customer service is absolutely not up to my standard.  I do not recommend them and will not use them again."
2,It's ok. Menu maybe a little too southern authentic for me.  Steak sandwich nothing to write yelp about :  ).
2,"Love the space and ambiance, was underwhelmed by the food. \n\nI had the flat iron steak and the mashed potatoes...My steak was overcooked, but the mashed potatoes were pretty good. For a party of four, other things ordered at the table was a beet salad, sea bass, mac and cheese, a salad and the cast iron chicken. Everything was received pretty well, though no one raved about their meal. I think I just picked the wrong thing on the menu. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was a side of bacon cheddar biscuits that were really good. I would 100% get those again. \n\nI'd come back, but the menu overall didn't speak to me that much, and I didn't have anything that really wowed me. Service was attentive, they were great with refilling drinks/waters as well.\n\nIt was an OK experience, with some high notes, but the food fell flat."
1,"Don't you wish this place was cheaper? And faster? And didn't have such a garish color scheme? Nicer employees? Maybe better food too? Well, actually a place like that exists. It's called schenley park cafe."
1,"What a let down! I had my hopes high... I like Chinese food but I had been afraid to get it anywhere in Champaign for fear of being disappointed. But after reading the menu I thought I'd give it a try as it looked authentic enough (to me...). Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (Hunan chicken), but it was really disappointing: bland Chinese American, nothing tasty, nothing original. I took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash (... I can't believe I'm confessing to this!...). Kudos, though, for: the very extensive menu, the friendly waitress, and staying till 11pm (which is rare for Champaign). Maybe I'll give it another try."
0,"I was astounded that there were so many tables available at dinner time on a Saturday...today I think I am learning why. Only ate sushi. Partly my own fault for thinking sushi in the dessert was a good idea. Today I have enjoyed several bottles of pedialite for the 'common' effect associated with food poisoning. And Tylenol to ease the stabbing pains in my gut. Should have listened to my instincts... Called them to let them know what I ate, hoping that I could stop them from poisoning someone else. Manager said he would have another manager call me back.... Never happened. I guess this is a call they are accustomed to getting. \nNeedless to say, I will not be going back.\n\nUPDATE****** The owner had an incorrect number for me but was able to contact me through yelp and offered an apology. He also gathered information that could help him in finding out what happened."
0,"Worst breakfast ever!\nwent over Monday morning for a breakfast with some friends. Over priced omlets/salads, took the food about 45 min. to come out, and tasted like airplane food... the best part of my breakfast was the toasted bread!"
2,"My husband and I went to Dos Caminos for our \""day-after our wedding\"" brunch. I used to come here when it was Agave and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was a tiny bit apprehensive. I'm glad we decided to give it a go!\n\nI will have to leave an update for this restaurant because we didn't have THE BEST experience, but it wasn't awful either,...so just the 3 stars will have to do for now. First of all, the seating on the patio is much better than it was under previous ownership. They have more tables outside and it feels more open. I've always loved that patio, but now it is a much more comfortable feel.\n\nWhen our server mentioned to us that we were there for brunch so we receive a complimentary cocktail if we would like, we were all about it. We took advantage and my hubby ordered a blended margarita and I ordered a Bloody Mary. I ended up having to send the Bloody Mary back because it tasted like peppered tomato juice. They had no problem substituting it though and I replaced it with a mimosa which was delicious. \n\nThe part that bothered us was that after we ordered our complimentary cocktail, we then found out from the server that our drinks were only complimentary if we ordered from the (very limited) brunch menu section. We were already half way through our drinks so we had to stick to that menu and there are really only a handful of options. Had we known this, we would have forgone the drinks and ordered from the lunch menu. \n\nWe ordered the breakfast quesadilla, one without bacon for myself, and we waited about 20 minutes after we placed our order and munched on the trio of salsa's in front of us. For those who don't like spicy food - STAY AWAY FROM THE orange salsa. My husband can't handle spice and he mistakenly thought that might be a mango salsa and he was wrong. It was incredibly spicy even to me and I loooove my spicy food. We were both pleased with our meal and the portion siize of these quesadillas are enough to feed 2 people easily. \n\nI will be back mainly for the lovely patio, but I also want to give their lunch and/or dinner menu a try."
1,"We ate at Palm for a friends birthday.  They were accomadating to a large group of 12 people.  I did not like the lobster bisque at all but had Chilean sea bass that was very good.  We also had the 3 cheese potatos which were fanatastic.  One major problem came at the end of the night.  We were walking out of the restaurant when the manager came over to us and said we were short on the bill.  We went back to check how much we had left and noticed that a $100 dollar bill was missing.  There were several of us that all saw the $100 go into the check presenter yet the waiter said that there was never one in there.  After being forced out of another hundred that we did not owe, I will never go back to this restaurant."
3,"The wait may discourage you. The location is not the most central. But it's all worth it. La Banquise is one of the first places I go to after a long trip away from Montreal.\n\nFor the \""classic\"" poutine, I don't think it's the best one out there (that would be Ashton's in Quebec City) but the choices of poutine is incredible, the cheese and fries are fresh, the portions are huge and the prices are decent. Go and satisfy your poutine craving. I wonder why is there no other places like this in Montreal!"
1,"The first thing you notice is the smell.   If I hadn't have been starving, I would have walked out.   The place is dark and dreary, with a wait staff to match.  Clearly they have their own little dramas going on that trump customer service.  But to be fair, they do all call you \""sweetie\"" and \""honey\""  once they get around to showing up, there's the consolation. My meal came fairly quickly, so no complaints there.\n\nThe food was actually decent.  I had the smoked whitefish salad appetizer, which was a nice plate for a single diner like myself.   The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.\n\nThe problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.  I just kept wondering what state the kitchen was in.   So, despite the decent food, I have to give this place a two star rating.   Maybe call Robert Irvine!   Unless it's freshened up and the smell is gone, I'm not going back.  Not even for such good whitefish salad!"
4,"In town for work, brought the wife along. Decided on a Tue night that it would be fun to rent a bike for the next day and do the Valley of Fire/Hoover Dam loop ride. Called early (7:00am) to try and see if they had a bike available and a rep called me back PROMPTLY at 8am when they opened. Nice!\nAfter a few minutes on the phone the rep found me a black 2013 Street Glide with a backrest, the exact bike we were looking for. They sent us a shuttle a couple hours later and in no time flat we were off!\nWe did the loop, took a little longer than expected (7 hours), but we stopped a LOT! The Valley of Fire is beautiful, hot (bring water), but really amazing, the Hoover Dam, impressive, the bike flawless. It was interesting to ride such a big bike, I have a Sportster at home. \nAnyways, we're here dropping off the bike and awaiting the shuttle to return us to our hotel. No problems in, or out. I highly recommend. The experience is well worth the rate, very affordable in my opinion."
2,"This store is pretty good. Yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products, particularly beef. We've been very happy with their produce, which we find noticeably better than Trader Joe.\n\nI wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection (we are used to the larger stores in Chicago). Also wish there was a liquor department but I'll probably have to run for state office for that. Frankly the worst part is often parking. Don't know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot (myself included) but man it can be a mess. \n\nAnyway we'll keep going at least for meats and produce."
4,Best cappuccino I've had in Charlotte. Counter Culture Coffee (I ordered this coffee when I had my machine and imho the best around) and baristas that know what they are doing.  Will be back to try the drip and/or pour over.
3,"I didn't think much of the place nor was it on my radar for restaurants I needed to try, but I was pleasantly surprised! Luckily for a holiday Sunday, it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. Ruben and I ordered their very large omelets and could only eat half! The portions are ridiculously generous and the prices are very inexpensive. That completely earned them another star. I tried the \""Plymouth Rock\"" with huge chucks of turkey breast, a lot of guacamole, and jack cheese with egg whites (I'm pretty sure there it was four eggs). Delicious. I got their \""Spuds\"" with my meal, which are like housemade potato chips just a little thicker, so it still had their texture with some crispy parts. Little under seasoned, but good! With your gigantic omelet, you also get a choice of toast, Pumpkin Bread, or Banana Nut Bread. You must get the Pumpkin or Banana Nut. We ordered one of each and really enjoyed it! I preferred the Banana Nut (yum!), but both were good - moist, just enough flavor and sweetness, and of course, a generous serving. Service was really great and overall, great experience."
1,"I have definitely been to better diners.  The decor was cute and the place was clean.  During the lunch hour on a Sunday, I was surprised to see only 2 tables taken.  The service was good, our waitress was friendly.  The menu was too \""busy\"" for my personal liking.  We got burgers (I had the bacon and cheddar cheese) and a grilled cheese sandwich for the little one.  I lost all hope for this place when we got our food.  Our burgers were far from \""fresh, handmade\""....they were obviously the frozen patties that I can buy at the grocery store.  The bacon and cheese were good but the lettuce and tomato were wilted and warm.  I have no idea what their \""special sauce\"" was made of, but it was the nastiest thing ever.  They mayo was sour.  Now, the bun was fabulous but everything else was a joke.  And the prices.....for what you get, definitely over priced.  Even the grilled cheese was gross.  Let me just say, it's hard to mess up a burger and grilled cheese, but I'd rather go to Burger King than eat here again."
2,"My first visit to Grazzianos was a bust do to some poor planning on my part and confusion on the part of the restaurant. Needless to say I was convinced to give it another try and I'm glad I did. I did the Monster Pizza Challenge (which I proudly failed) and the rest of my party had purchased the buffet. \nThe Monster Pizza challenge was fun and the pizza itself was really good. This thing is an enormous pizza. like table covering big. The crust is pretty think but the cheese and all the toppings (especially the bacon) all come together to make it a good salty cheesy fun experience. The buffet had a bunch of different pizzas like bbq chicken and pepperoni, plus they had salad and mac and cheese. The apple pie pizza was pretty interesting and they also had fresh brownies. very nice value. \nThere is a play area for kids to earn tickets for prizes but its off to the side and not annoying like a chuck e cheese. Plus they serve beer by the pitcher for the grown ups. Dave and Roberto were very attentive and friendly and the service was they provided was great. \nMy only gripe is that they air fake oops i mean fox news on their TVs. Minor complaint but c'mon guys us bleeding heart liberals like pizza too:) I would recommend CNN for a neutral news vibe or maybe just ditch the news all together and put food network on or just make all the TVs ESPN 1 and 2. Anyway good pizza, fun place."
0,"Anything they say is vegan is not! Everything has fish oil, or oil that has been used to fry fish. There is a lot of cross contamination, and some of their employees are not being paid properly."
3,"Went to visit my son and daughter in law this past weekend. We were at some casino which was a little lame and my daughter in law said let's go to The Big Bang. Dueling Pianos reminded me of Dueling Banjos and not something I am overly interested in. Got there and while my daughter in law and son were looking for some coupon at the newspaper rack the cool bouncer let me in with a stamp on my arm and a smile. Thank you kind sir. Kids finally met up with me and downstairs we went. What a trip, it was busy and everyone was having a great time. The crowd was mixed from college kids to older. The music was fantastic. I have to say it was one of the best parts of my vacation this trip to Arizona. It was good fun all the way around. I also want to mention our waitress was just a doll. Loved the bouncer on the side of the stage doing dance moves as were the bartenders. Just a gret evening and I will make sure to go back every trip out there."
3,"Their hot chocolate is heaven in a cup made with a shot of real chocolate sauce!  When i went it was the perfect way to defrost after walking the streets of Edinburgh.  But i have to say, drink in moderation!  Their hot chocolate was so good that i had a second large cup and i wasn't even thirsty.  It was just that good.  I ended up walking around Edingurgh feeling sick and bloated, but it was well worth it.  I learned my lesson the next day and got 2 small hot chocolates instead of 2 large ones."
3,"Stopped in to get a quick coffee between meetings at CMU. The staff is friendly, the space is nice and casual, and the coffee is hot. Espresso drinks available, along with regular coffee, pizza, and sandwiches."
1,"Oh, Gus's.  For the past 2 1/2 years I've lived within a couple miles of this place, so it's near inevitable that I eat here occasionally.  And honestly, it was okay the first couple times.  Except I finally had to ask them to please put the onions on my pizza BEFORE cooking it, and they grudgingly obliged.\n\nThe pizza tastes okay - sometimes.  They will bring you food at 3am when you are too drunk to get it yourself.  And there you have the nicest things I can think of to say about this place.\n\nService is always slow and sometimes bordering on curt.  Even if you go in to the drab establishment, it can sometimes take ten or more minutes to get a single slice.  Their pizza drips grease and will soak through the box.  The wings are mediocre.  I only eat here if it's 2am and my neighbor wants pizza.  Even then I can only handle one slice."
3,"This was my first time at the Carnegie Music Hall of Homestead. I had heard a lot of good things about it, but never saw a show that perked my interested enough to go. UNTIL Sara Bareilles announced she was coming to Pittsburgh. My friend and I bought the tickets the moment they went on sale. We planned to meet for dinner at the Waterfront before heading over to the show, and there's a ton of options to pick from. We decided on Bravo (see review) which was really good. We thought we'd be too early, so we shopped around a bit, but we should have gotten there early if we would have known the parking situation ahead of time. There is no parking lot, only street parking around the venue itself, and all of the houses that surround it. We had to park 3 blocks away and neither of us were familiar with the area. This is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars. \n\nWalking up to the building, it has this grand staircase that welcomes you and it's very old-world looking. Kind of like where you would imagine men would wear tuxes and women would wear gowns to go see a show. The theatre inside has this huge red velvet curtain on either side and at the top. It had these old wooden seats, and this beautiful balcony. The thing I was most impressed with were the acoustics. The sound in there was amazing, and for a small venue that can be challenging. \n\nThey set up a \""bar\"" on concert nights in the library area, and where you would check out a book is now where you get a drink. People were standing around all of the books. sitting in the reading chairs with their wine. It was a really cool set-up and atmosphere to add to the experience.\n\nI would definitely go back here again for another show, and I would DEFINITELY get there earlier than we did for a better parking spot! I give this venue 2-thumbs up!"
4,So darn good.    Owner very sweet too.    Better than the other donut shops on the street.    Blueberry Apple fritter my fav
2,"Half-price pizza 9-12--good deal! Didn't love the pizza though. It was just ok. I got three kinds--the Bianca (which isn't as good as it sounded), the veggie pizza (which had a strange paste on it, the consistency of which made me kind of feel like gagging), and the peppers and sausage pizza (the best of the three). I've also gone a few times for drinks. Service can be either good or just rude. There is one guy there who clearly hates all his customers. The salads there though are to die for. I have had two salads--one was a salad with ramps and duck. The other was a honey mustard chicken salad. I loved them both so much that I often think of them. They were on special I think though (haven't seen them since). If all other salads are that good there, I'll definitely keep going back!\n\nAlso, their breakfast sandwiches at the pick up window in the morning are very good and LARGE!"
0,"I give this place less than a year before they close thier doors. Horrible customer service by a young blonde girl that works thier ( must be owners daughter) because I would have already fired her. Cupcakes are dry and don't taste fresh, to be honest Smith's has better cupcakes. I really used to like this place before new ownership but they really need to step it up."
4,"Mike and his associates at Wilhelm's Scottsdale shop have always provided reliable, fast, and, most importantly, honest service. As my auto approaches 100K miles, I know I can depend on them for dependable advice and repairs."
0,"Roberto's isn't really my choice place when going for Mexican. The food is decent so it always passes when in need. \n\nTwo big complaints for this location. I've heard of refilling horchata at a charge but $1 to refill a medium sized Pepsi cup? Better off ordering a soda.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they charge $1.25 to use your card. Be sure to bring cash. \n\nDidn't know merchant services were charging restaurants a flat fee to process credit cards. It's always been a small fee plus the percentage. Is my money not good?\n\nI don't appreciate them making profit to take my money. Won't be coming here especially if I don't have cash with me."
3,"Good place to go for men. A little upset because the barber only did a royal shave and he forgot to shave my husband head. However, the royal shave left my husband's face as soft as a baby's bottom. For lack of attention to detail, that's why they only get 4 stars."
0,"I have been to this location many times to get propane in my truck, and every single time, I have left there feeling very frustrated. To get propane, you pull up to the propane tank area and ring a doorbell to let the employees know that you need assistance. There is no way to communicate with the employees without going into the building, and you can not see to the inside from the propane tank area. There is no way of knowing if the bell worked after pressing the button, and no way of knowing if anyone is at the register area to hear it.\n\nI have never waited less than five minutes for someone to respond at this location, and today it took me more than 25 minutes to get out of there. I went inside the building and could not find ANYONE manning the 'store' and no way to signal or summon anyone, but many employees were standing around in back. I called out to the nearest one, who was cleaning a truck, and told him I needed help. He said he would send someone out, so I went back to my truck to wait. Another five minutes passed, and the same employee drove the truck I had just seen him cleaning to the front. I made him aware that I was STILL waiting, and he said he would send someone. Another five minutes and I felt like I was being held hostage. not being able to leave because my tank was empty and I didn't know if I could make it to another station that sold propane. Yet another employee drove a truck to the front, and I let HIM know I had been waiting a very long time, and he said he would send someone out. Oy. \n\nAfter waiting in 104F heat, someone FINALLY came out and filled my tank, and then the \""pay at the pump\"" gadget failed to work, and I was asked to go inside again to pay. Once inside there was some other computer problem and I had to wait another few minutes for that to get sorted out. Twenty-five minutes to get gas in my truck is ridiculous.  I have never rented a truck from this location, so I can't speak for their customer service in that area, but I will NOT be using this location again except in cases of extreme emergency. VERY disappointed with my experiences here. \n\nLuckily I work near the Gilbert location, and their customer service is outstanding. I will have to arrange my schedule to fill up there from now on."
4,"Awesome. Awesomeawesomeawesomeawesomeawesome.\n\nOur waiter was funny and personable and patient. He was quite a gent.\n\nThe food was awesome and there were vegetarian options as far as the eye could see. I loved it.\n\nMy only complaint is that the patrons next to us seemed way uptight but that happens.\n\nLoved it, can't wait to go back."
1,Service was ok but not inviting. The country fried steak was terrible. We also has the BLT sandwich which was good. The fries and hash browns were plain. They have a cheap lunch menu but I will not return to try it.
3,"Despite the stunning lack of originality in the naming department this is a bar that Leith Walk has been in need of for some time.\nQuieter in terms of atmosphere than the likes of Boda etc. you feel under no pressure to neck as much booze as possible and stumble out into the night  chilling out in the comfy, dark wood surroundings is fun enough.\nGiven the larger premises there is a larger range of drinks available than at the Drummond Street branch so the opportunities for trying something new are greater. Innis & Gunn's new Rum Cask brew goes down well at around the \u00a33 mark (7.4% so plenty of bang for your buck) and they also stock a couple of Stewart's bottled products as well as a bunch of others.\nI can see myself going here quite often in the year ahead.\nThe tortilla pizzas on the menu are a great invention & the Monday night quiz makes for an enjoyable start to the week."
3,"I've done several arrangements with Flora Unique now and it's nice to say this place still rocks. I unfortunately know these things because I am a very frequent patron of the doghouse.\n\nRachel is very helpful, and will be more than happy to do arrangements with a more modern feel that really set themselves apart."
3,The food was excellent as was the service. However it is hard to hear as the acoustics were not so good. The owner came by the table and told us it was going to be fixed in the winter.  Highly recommend this restaurant
4,By far seeing Dr Naiman has been the best experience ever for myself and my son...originally we had interviewed a different doctor in the practice but once we delivered Dr Naiman was the doctor from the group doing rounds for those few days...my husband and I made a decision to continue to see him because he was so knowledgeable. ..had a great bedside manner and made us feel extremely comfortable and took the time to answer or questions and educate us... you cannot go wrong with Dr Naiman as your pediatrician for your child....
2,"Clean dining room with a.friendly corpus courteous staff.\n\nFood quality was good, but it was a bit on the bland side."
0,"WOW! That was really bad! This has got to be some of the WORST food I have ever been served. Brought my small family of 3. My wife and son left in the middle of dinner to go eat somewhere else. We were hungry so almost anything would have tasted good, but so many things were done so very poorly here. The first batch of cornbread we were served looked like scraps off a plate. We asked for fresh cornbread and it still tasted dry and tasteless. It looked bad, it tasted bad. \n\nThe grilled side of veggies for my wife were all greasy and tasted awful. The BBQ Baker tasted like an old reheated microwaved potato. I could only describe the flavor as \""stale potato\"". The side of mashed potatoes were a brown yellow color. They tasted about as good as they looked, which wasn't good. \n\nThe meat in the sandwich was okay. I wouldn't call the meat good or bad, it was just okay. The buns for both sandwiches were dry and 'bready' tasting. Not good. My wife and son didn't like the barbeque sauce. I thought it was okay, but i found myself trying to eat as little of it as possible...just enough to get the dry sandwich to slide down...so not a good sign. \n\nIf it couldn't get any worse, we took the nasty grilled veggies and \""baked\"" potato back to the counter and traded it in for the BBQ Salad. The menu reads \""Crisp Mixtures of Greens\""...um no...the salad was completely iceberg lettuce out of a bag with a few traces of shredded carrots and 2 slices of tomato, then will a scoop of beef thrown on top. The box of salad had a \""Friday\"" sticker on it so it was made at least a day ago. The tomato slices were noticeably stale. ...$6.99 for some stale iceberg lettuce out of a bag???...are you kidding me?! \n\nAlso, ironically, the menu describes the BBQ Baker as \""Fresh Baked Potato\"". How can you say that when it was clearly a Reheated potato in the Micowave? \n\nLastly, I found it really annoying that i asked for a water cup and was given a styrofoam cup the size of a shot glass. When I asked why I can't get a regular sized styrofoam cup, the register girl said the owner gets mad if they give out the bigger cups for water. The counter guy then tried to explain to me that the bigger cups have to be charged for because since they are bigger they cost more. Please!...Sorry if I don't subscribe to the \""soda with every meal\"" corporate America brainwashing philosophy. Personally, I like to drink water. I think it's healthier...just my opinion. \n\nAnyways, I commented to my wife that the ridiculously small cheapy-sized water cups showed to me that the owner cared more about himself than the people he was serving. Then the food was brought out to my table and my eyes about popped out. I'll eat almost anything, but 90% of the food at this place is just plain garbage."
1,"Steve could use some more CSR training. Decent PSL, clean bathrooms, good parking but focus definitely seemed to be on their drive thru and not the walk in customers."
0,"Went here last Saturday since it was in the same hotel where our show was. Big mistake! Husband ordered fish tacos and it was ok but not much different from any fish taco ordered through a fast food drive thru. I ordered chicken tacos and it was by far the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. It tasted like chicken boiled in water with a sprinkle of cheese on top. Nothing else. Sure they gave little cups of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole but it didn't help it taste any better. It's like they forgot to season it or something. I only took a few bites and gave up. When you spend $80 for two entrees and drinks you expect some edible food.  Oh and they tell you that you get a mini appetizer with every order so I got mini nachos which consisted of three tortilla chips and it took 30 minutes to get. This place was such a joke. Never again!"
0,"When your host says your rooms will be comped, I don't think that means you have to pay for the rooms.\n\nFirst off, that is completely misleading and false information.  And basically baiting someone to come.  Then, after you get there, they say oh the first night is comped by the rest isn't.  Well you already made plans to be in Vegas, what the hell are you supposed to do at midnight.  When the managers are conveniently out.  Well, you sign the paper acknowledging because the person at the front desk says the rate is negotiable and we can talk to our host about it.  FALSE.  The host changes his story and says, oh hey, it depends on how much you gamble.  \n\nWait.  I thought we got the comped rooms cuz someone spent thousands gambling LAST time.  There was no contingencies or clauses that stated we must play a certain amount... shady Mc Shades.\n\nI'm pretty sure my friend, who booked the rooms, could win in a legal battle in court, you lying scumbag hotel.  He has all the phone conversations in digital la la land.  But alas, a couple hundred bucks is not worth the waste of time.  \n\nMe and my friends will go back to Palazzo and enjoy our sometimes (but never lied about) comped rooms there.   I will never come back here except to spit on the dirty management.  Is this how you run a business?  Idiot.\n\nP.S. The rooms are small."
2,"CPK, as some know it, is an upscale pizza chain.  Upscale from say a Pizza Hut but not too upscale, as you can dress casually.  At one time CPK was kind of special.  Now you can get their pizza anywhere from standalone locations, to airports (Chad E.) to your grocer's freezer section.  So, it was on this visit that I decide to NOT get the pizza.\n\nAs typical for any place near South Park mall at lunch, the place was packed.  Fortunately, we were seated quickly and promptly waited on.  Upon pursuing the menu and not wanting pizza, I came across my selection...Carnitas Tacos.  The order arrived at the table as two flour tacos w/ not too spicy shredded pork in the middle of each taco.  Topping these tacos was salsa verde, shredded lettuce, cabbage, red onions, and cilantro.  The dish does come w/ avocado but I nixed that topping.  W/ a squeeze of lime, these tacos were pretty decent.  Great flavor and filling w/out leaving you stuffed.  The side of tortilla chips was the only part of the meal that tasted overly processed...like corn flavored Baked Lays.  \n\nAll of this for $10.75 was a little pricey for two tacos and chips.  But then again, you are in SP and everything here is a little pricey.\n\nI recommend this dish as a great healthy alternative to a cheese laden pizza."
2,"I had been coming here for about  2 years and I notice they sold the place. I went to eat with friends and every plate is different. Las Vegas roll, ninja roll, cherry blossom. Another not in a good way. Sorry to say but it was better before. And I think the prices went up too. Even with the happy hour. Only thing I can say is the new waitress is really nice and friendly very pleasant."
0,"This will be concise: we requested a quote for my iPhone issues, and were immediately sent a text by the technician, Eric.  I wanted to support him because he is a UNLV grad and had good reviews.  He gave us a reasonable estimate but said he could not do the repair until the weekend was over because he was missing parts.  We told him never mind because we needed it done over the weekend.  He wrote back that he located the parts and gave us a time frame.  We agreed to a specific time and location on Sunday.  He said he would text us when he was on his way.\n\nWe never heard from him, so at the scheduled appointment time, we texted and called him.  We did not get a call back or a text back.  So he is unreliable and I still have a broken phone.  Don't waste your time."
0,"An hour and a half later and cold, over priced for bad service. I used to really enjoy this establishment, however; I've been coming here for years and the service has been getting progressively worse, regrettably I will not likely be back, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone"
2,"a wonderful neighborhood place to do crossword puzzles and drink great coffee.\n\nvegetarian sausage? why yes, yes i will."
3,"Delicious! I started with Conundrum Mixed White from Cali, then had the Chilean Sea Bass Ponzu (FREAKING AMAZING) and the Jalepeno Tuna Shashimi... Both are amazing appetizers. I then ordered the Sea Scallops and the side of brown butter Brussel Sprouts... I've never had a side as good as THOSE BRUSSEL SPROUTS! Addicting. I was dreaming about them last night! The Scallops are in a butter sauce that I could drink! Thankfully they serve the dish with bread to soak up some of the amazing sauce! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and visit this restaurant! The staff is amazing!"
2,"I went there with my girl today the restaurant itself was really nice. Food was alright we ordered crying tiger, coconut lemongrass soup and chicken pad thai. Everything together was around 40 bucks. A lil bit more expensive than other thai restaurants I've been to but it's understandable since this location is very nice and decorated well. Staffs were friendly. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I had the option. Food tasted alright. Soup was too sour and so as pad thai. Crying tiger was good though."
3,"Tr\u00e8s connu, le Venetian est un tr\u00e8s beau casino et ses galeries int\u00e9rieures m\u00e9ritent autant le d\u00e9tour que ses canaux \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur. J'avais peur de l'effet un peu kitch, mais finalement non, le lieu est assez charmant. Passez-y si vous \u00eates \u00e0 Vegas."
1,"Are Koreans really giving this a half decent review? NO. Because it kinda blows.\n\nOn Service-food and beverage is not a natural skill, but it would be good if they trained their staff to be more attentive (and friendly)\n\nThe food: Poor representation of real Korean food.what Korean place doesn't have kimbab outside of the lunch menu? When I went here it was considered only on the lunch menu and way overpriced and wasn't even that good. Wtf??? Their panjan is not fresh. Not to mention that they are stingy with it. The deji bulgogi (spicy pork) was not at all good and their kalbi was very fatty.\n\nI honestly think this place is good for people who think they know Korean food (who really don't) because their friend's friend was Korean or something but most Korean loving hungry souls will go straight to Takamatsu."
4,"The best place in Las Vegas to buy quality high-end jewelry.  My husband has bought all my fabulous rings, earrings, watches etc. and I bought his engagment ring and watch here as well.  It's the only place in Las Vegas to jewelry at great prices.  Make sure to speak to Tanya, she consistently gives great customer service and continues to help my husband and I with all our jewelry needs.  We'll never go to another jewelry store again."
4,"Great Indian Food here. I have eaten here several times now (always the buffet), and it is great! What sets this apart is the quality and selection. There are many different dishes, veg, and non veg. They have several things that I have not seen before at a buffet, including several different types of sweets. I have always received very good service. This is not a fancy place,  but the price is right. I really like that they are not afraid to have some spicy dishes. Most other places in town are very boring in that there is very little spice. Here, at least you have a choice. I would recommend this place to anyone who really wants great food at a great price."
2,"Chaser's all in all definitely isn't one of my favorite bars in Madison. The cheaper \""specials\"" are served in tiny plastic cups, and rather than using a normal 16oz glass for taps, they use a skinny glass with their logo on it and charge you the same thing. When you order a burger, they nickel-and-dime you by asking you to \""upgrade\"" for the cost of lettuce, tomato, and fries. Shady business practices like that are fucking unacceptable, and make me want to never come back.\n\nHowever, I think may keep doing so just because I was so impressed by the last burger I had here. It was the first bacon cheeseburger I had ordered in perhaps ever where I could actually taste the bacon - and it was so good. The burger was also so huge that I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. This was some of the most expensive bar food I'd ever had, but at least I feel like I kind of got my money's worth.\n\nChaser's has a lot of space and decent music, which really improves the atmosphere and sets it just a cut above a lot of the surrounding campus bars. It's just a shame they think we're all idiots."
2,"The Sushi here is not as good as Sumo Sushi 2 BUT it IS pretty darn good!\n\nPlus: You can order half rolls\nMinus: The rolls did not taste as good as Sumo Sushi\n\nEvery roll seem to have had Spicy Tuna in it. I love it but it all begins to taste the same... \n\nI was going to list all the rolls we had and rate them to taste but everyone has different tastes so I suggest if you are going to Vegas and do not wish to stray too far from the strip, this is the place to go!\n\nIf you want to stray a lil, go to Sumo Sushi 2!"
1,Went here exactly one year ago and got my 16 yr old daughters nose pierced. Today we went there because her nose stud came out 24 hours ago and there is no way to put them back in yourself because they make their own jewelry and it needs to be put in from the inside. The piercer tried to push through her nose with a blunt piece of niobium. Blood everywhere then he told her to lay back  and blood started flowing into her eye. So i grabbed kleenex cause he didnt stop it. He then says it was closed and would need to be repierced at a later date because now it was swollen. I went home and cleaned it up with some hibiclens. There was a whole new parcial hole next to her original piercing. just went and bought a stainless nose ring and tahdah went right through. I am a better piercer. Now to let the other hole heal.
2,Wasn't impressed with the food I the restaurant...save your money by ordering your Frozen Chocolate at the outside window and lounge in the outdoor cabana tent. The Frozen drinks are a yummy break from the alcoholic beverages. My favorite is the white chocolate...it's piled high with whipped cream and white chocolate flakes sprinkled on top. It's expensive...but worth it. I ate in the restaurant and the server was super! She talked me out of a certain dish with her honest opinion of it...and made recommendations of others. She didn't write anyone's order down and that was impressive. The food was mediocre and overpriced. I'll stick with ordering just the frozen drinks and skip the unnecessarily long line for the food.
2,"It's about average. My complaint would be how the entry is setup, and how cramped it is when you get inside. They could let about 25% less people in, and it would still be pretty tight. We had a bad experience with a promoter there that lied to our faces. He's a typical douche so I blew it off though. I made it to the dance floor once, and I was getting pushed way too much trying to dance with my wife and friends. So I stayed closer to the bar where I was almost as cramped but closer to the alcohol."
3,"Attempted to make reservations via Open Table for 2 weeks leading up to my trip to no avail.  We got there at about 5p on a weekday (Wednesday) and attempted to get seated.  The lady at the hostess stand said they \""were not accepting reservations any longer for tonight.\""  She invited us to Lounge 107 which is above the restaurant and does not spin like the restaurant does down below.  Below the lounge there were many open tables which were vacant, so why not take reservations?!  We sat upstairs where the waitress was good and the food even better!  Martini's were GREAT (Happy Hour 4-7p Buy one get one free!) and cold!  I would go back but for spending $200.00 for a meal at a bar table I rather have been downstairs."
4,Awesome pizza & wings! Great specials and great prices.
1,"I don't know what this bar was in it's past life. Probably a really awesome shithole where you could grab a drink and chat up a mentally ill local. Unfortunately what it is now is a place that harbors the highest concentration of douchey hipsters I have seen outside of Williamsburg....ever. Weirdly this fact did not totally bother me here. Yes all the guys have ironic facial hair, yes they also are all wearing ironic band t-shirts while the ladies are ironically dressed like they bought all their clothes out of a Delias catalog in the early 90's and yes they ALL use the word 'ironic' CONSTANTLY and out of context. But none of this really irritated me to a point where I felt like I had to find the next closest bar to get shit faced at. The bartender is a dick who makes it his job to let you know how 'uncool' you are (as if anybody after the 7th grade gives a shit:) and the barback is, I am almost certain, partially retarded or doing a really long running impression of Beavis. The patrons are pricks and nobody here has the slightest inkling of a sense of humor but the drinks are cheap and the DJ is pretty cool and that's all that really mattered to us last night. Farewell AZ, you will not be missed:)"
2,"Great outdoor patio & live musics--super sweet & romantic. Good wine--but it was super spendy for not that great/size portion of food. Also, the \""free snack\"" option from yelp is inactive apparently. \n\nIt was OK. Not as good as Salut Wine Bar in Tempe, AZ."
2,"Good, but not exceptional. \n\nIf you like it spicy on a scale of 1-10, order an 11. \n\nI've been there a couple times and the pad thai and tom kha soup are the only note worthy dishes I have experienced. It is a bit pricey for the small portions. If it was an extraordinary dish I wouldn't mind the prices, unfortunately that's not the case."
2,"Not bad ... Beautiful building, but confusing floor plan. Young crowd abounds. Beautiful silhouette on the exterior drive-up at night."
1,"I was extremely underwhelmed.\n\nThe decor fit a higher end Persian restaurant and the service was average. I am not normally a fan of basil but the basil and onion with their homemade bread was good.\n\nWe started off with the hoummos and eggplant but they messed the order up! As the entr\u00e9e, we ordered the Tour of Persia and a large Greek salad with a skewer of chicken. The portions were good but it all went down hill from here. The rice was undercooked to the point that it frequently got stuck in my teeth. The chicken was undercooked,  as well,  but was seasoned well. The salad was extremely poorly cut and was difficult to eat because of that. \n\nThen at the very end they kept both appetizers on the bill, even though we only ate one! \n\nI had heard a lot of good things about this place but I won't be coming back anytime soon."
0,"The only reason we went to this dump is cuz we couldnt get into Tao (at the Venetian) because we were wearing sneakers (which wouldnt have been a problem, but because of some issues, it was). Anyways we got in here for free and I seriously would have been enraged if I had to pay anything more than $1 for admission. When I first walked in the first thing out of my mouth was \""wow this place is small\"" and \""damn no one is here\"".... that was pretty much the theme of the night. The only saving grace for this place was that they played half way decent music. I should have known not to come here after reading the reviews on yelp, but i was stubborn and i paid the ultimate price."
0,"NOTE:  This was a 4-star review, but the food quality and ESPECIALLY customer service have gone down the tubes.  See update below.\nComplaining I can't find a good meatball sub in Phoenix, I was referred to Santisi Brothers.  I was told that the meatballs are still made by the brothers' mother, so I was intrigued. \nSantisi Brothers did not disappoint.  That sub was so freaking good!!!  I got the 1/2 sandwich, which included two meatballs smothered under mozzarella and marinara on a toasted baguette-type roll.  Amazing.  The bread was soft inside with just the right crust, the meatballs were sizable (that's what she said!), and they did not scrimp on the mozzarella.  Since this is their only location in the valley, we will be sure to be back.  (It's right off I-17, close to the 101, so that's not hard.)\nIf you like sports, go!  This place has each wall covered in TVs - huge to 13\"", they don't spare a bit of viewing area.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the seating leaves a bit to be desired.  We sat at a hightop table with stools.  Next are a row of tables with nicer chairs (with backs), and the row closest to the TVs - who wants to sit there?  Music - we could hear each other, but agreed a table of four might have to shout.  Our server, Ariel, was very enjoyable, nice, and attentive.\nBig beer and bar selection.  Husband's Kiltlifter was in a huge beer mug and he was happy to see a few IPAs.  I had a John Daly that was verrry tasty.  It's one of those sneaky super-yummy drinks...  Sweet iced tea, lemonade, and vodka - I'll be stealing that recipe this summer!\nHusband had the turkey club, which was large enough to be funny to watch him eat, but he said it was unremarkable.  Side of fries were also really, really good.  Perfect amount of potato, crispiness, and salt.  We also had garlic knots, which are served with marinara and pretty tasty, but left me wishing there was a little ball of mozzarella in the middle.  House salads were... house salads.  Nothing special there.\nTo review: great for sports (I'm sure they can spare a TV for your game), may want to go early for good seats, good bar, and some great food.  EAT/DRINK:  Meatball sub, french fries, and a John Daly.  All wonderful.\nPS - Kitchen is open till 11pm Sun-Thu, midnight Fri-Sat."
1,"I went here yesterday for Sunday night football.  They are a \""Chargers bar\"" and I am a chargers fan to say the least.  Lots of chargers fans there but the last time I go there again.  The drink and food specials were a joke. $3 bud light bottles but they dont tell you the drafts are $4.50 for a 12 oz draft!! Really??!! The place is loud and the TVs are in hard to view spots when sitting in booths.  We left halfway throught the first quarter and found a great spot called Bluehawk with awesome specials and tons of flatscreens.  Maybe a good place to hang out but horrible to watch sporting events at.  Cute waitresses but slow service.  Goodbye Al's garage get some better specials during football because enough bars have them them to keep me away."
0,"With guests in town wanting an ice cream treat, we passed on visiting local favorites Sweet Republic and Sugar Bowl and chose this Cold Stone location instead. We arrived to two employees to handle our order of 6 desserts. The female employee spilled the chocolate sample offered down the front of the display case (and never took the five seconds it required to clean it, the entire time of our stay there). In an order that added strawberries, the frozen (not fresh) strawberries seemed to be a significant challenge, because as she attempted to mash the frozen fruit with her scooper (rather than slice them), she twice only succeeded in propelling them across the restaurant. This caused her to laugh about how she couldn't handle them. The replacement berries proved only half as challenging, only sending one into the atmosphere. She moved on to the banana, and had to be asked to include a second strawberry into the cream. The second order that included strawberries did successfully manage to keep any from escaping, but the strawberries themselves weren't so much \""folded\"" in to the mix, as the less frozen outer layer of the fruit was just assaulted off the fruit's frozen core, leaving behind strawberry-tinged ice chunks.\n\nFinally, It was time for them to make a simple chocolate shake with heath bar. Small. The attendant poured an excessive-but-unmeasured volume of milk into the blender, and scraped the sides of the chocolate cream tin and added it. She then moved on to another order in the back (I think she went on a quest for a cookie). This left the other clerk to take over, and he proceeded to blend the shake for well over a minute. One in my party said, \""I hope you wanted chocolate milk, because that's what you're going to get.\""  The clerk affirmed my suspicions of this by complaining to the first, \""This is way too watery.\""  Then, he turned and offered it to me!  \""Would you like whipped cream on this?\"" he asked. I said, \""I'm not taking this,\"" certain that if whipped cream were added, the shake didn't have enough consistency to keep the added cream from sinking to the bottom.  \n\nMy refusal didn't elicit any apology, or an offer to start over. The first clerk did ask, \""do you want me to make something else?\"" But her initial effort and the now-long line (at least 10 patrons deep) were enough disincentive to keep me from giving this dynamic duo another shot. My out-of-town guests said, \""We'll never go to another Cold Stone.\"" And we locals will have a story for a long time coming of our Bogus Cold Stone adventure, every time we treat our guests to Sugar Bowl or Sweet Republic."
1,"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with my stay.  From what everyone said about the place, I was really excited to finally stay at a 5 star resort on the strip.  The room itself was 5 stars--the bathroom had a great shower and a separate room for the toilet.  The bed was probably the comfiest I have ever slept in.  I went to bed early just so I could sleep more in the bed.\n\nHowever, that was about where the good stuff ends.  We stayed in the Venezia tower and whoever designed that should no longer be designing hotels.  It was a freaking maze to get to our room!  My mom was with me, and she has pain in her legs, and the walk was way too far to get to the room from the valet.  I would not recommend this hotel to people with ambulatory issues.\n\nAlso, when I went to the Venezia pool there was no one there to serve drinks.  Someone collecting towels by the pool told me to go to Bouchon and walk up to the bar.  I started to, but two separate employees told me that I was not allowed inside because I only had shorts and my bathing suit top on.  I would have gladly not come in your restaurant if I didn't have to!  And then the bartender made the wrong drinks, and very rudely insisted that I did order what he made and reluctantly made me a new drink.  Eventually, a cocktail waitress did show up and we were able to get drinks from her (which she made by hand and were much better than the ones from Bouchon).\n\nI couldn't believe that room service charged a delivery fee.  This may be standard at hotels and I just don't know, but it seems silly.  It's like a drive thru charging you for using their drive thru lane.\n\nLastly, the folks when I checked in were very firm that if we used the mini fridge and even so much as moved stuff around, we would be charged a restocking fee.  First, it is stupid to not allow folks to use the fridge in their room that they're paying for.  Second, there was stuff still leftover in the fridge from a previous guest: half a thing of milk, leftover beer and two open water bottles.  I called the maid service and they said they would be right up to get it.  When I checked out it was still there.  Ridiculous.  I will very closely be watching my credit card statement to make sure I wasn't charged for the maid service's mistake.\n\nI would never stay here again.  For what they charge, I expected a lot more."
0,"I wanted to wash my car myself and my boyfriend said absolutely not take it to Danny's and get a VIP wash. What a mistake, I wasted my afternoon doing that rather than taking an hour to make it spotless myself. They did nothing no vacuum no windshield not even a wipe down, he literally threw a air freshmen on the seat and tried to send me off. So super pissed I drove back up and said this is terrible redo it. I just think it's unprofessional to do a crappy job to begin with, you have 100 people working right now this shouldn't be an issue. I will never come back here."
4,Just plain awesome!  Love it.  Have visited the Jade Monkey and thought we would give the Atomic a try.  Will spend our money at both places!  Tremendous job ! will cocktail there every chance we get!
3,"I like to read real books and physically turn the pages.  Reading an e-reader just doesn't feel right.  \n\nAnyhow, B&N has a great selection.  If you want to read in the store and have a cup of coffee, you can do that too.  A little music store to boot.  \n\nThe employees that I came in contact with were kind and helpful."
1,"The hostess was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Granted, I did not have a pizza which looked and smelled great, but the food was average at best. I was disappointed."
1,"Marbella, a Spanish tapas restaurant, just opened in October.  Great location in the former Ruth's Chris @ Flamingo & Arville.  Not much has changed.  It still looks about the same.  I checked this spot out with my friend for Happy Hour, which is 50% of apps.  We ordered 3 apps & a couple glasses of wine each.   I have to give the apps 2 thumbs down for complete lack of flavor.  If you come here stick to the drinks.  The food just isn't good.  On the upside, they are new and have time to improve.  If you want to delight your taste buds with tastylicious tapas, Firefly is still the go to spot."
4,"We bought a Groupon and my husband went there for a lunch date and were told the groupons were only good after 3 but they made an exception anyways, the food was wonderful, huge portions and great staff"
4,Great stuff if you can afford their prices.
0,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  While our puppy is thankfully healthy, she is now nearly a year old and we've continually gotten the run around from Kristen about her AKC paperwork.  Just gives excuse after excuse- sent to wrong address, problems at AKC, out of town, asst was supposed to take care of it... on and on and on.  I would never go back to her for another puppy, total scam.  Find another breeder."
3,"Press Coffee is a great Sat/Sun morning stop. My boyfriend and I had a lazy day several weeks ago and stopped in. I had a chai latte and he had a smoothie for our \""breakfast\"". Both were very good! I love a good chai latte and it is difficult to find a place the serves the right blend of spicy and sweet (most are made way too sweet for my taste). I think their chai tea rivaled my favorite in NYC. Then it was on to the \""lunch\"" portion (hey, I said it was a lazy day). We each ordered sandwiches which were both tasty. \n\nThey have an outdoor patio and the windows are open for nice weather. I love having a local coffee shop nearby to support!"
4,"Excellent food.  Period.  No frills just good barbecue.   The staff if friendly and the service is good.  It's a good value and one of the few places in the valley you can get a beef rib!  Don't confuse \""can't stop smokin\"" with Rudy across the street.  I have eaten at both and this place completely outdoes rudys."
0,"Recently purchased a car here. Thought it would be decent, due to average reviews and featured on an app I downloaded for recommended dealers. By far not the best experience. They will tell you what you want to hear during the dealing process, and then make all sorts of excuses not to follow through with promises. \n\nHave had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. \n\nCame time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it \""threw up red flags\"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up \""red flags\"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  \n\nThese people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, the car blew a head gasket a month after we bought it. They want $2600 to fix it, and will not do anything in good faith. Waste of a lot of money $1700 to be exact (down payment, first month worth of payments and all the towing)... Words of advise...STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. There are way better dealers in the valley that will help you. We now have to save up for another down payment for a different car. They can eat s**t."
3,"The Red Hawk is a locals bar that is good for gamers during the day and for the partier at night.  Come as you are, casual.  Great food and great people."
4,This is a beautiful restaurant! It has beautiful high ceilings and is very well kept. Went there for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was delicious! Our waiter was very polite and attentive. We will definitely be back!
4,"Tobin Hearing center made my hearing sense so natural , mostly I forget I have them on .these group are personable caring precise , love them with bottom of my heart. Thank you for genuine service .you will have my blessings every day"
3,The place has reopened under a new owner.  They have cleaned it up quite a bit.  Prices are good and I will be checking it out again.
4,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would!  Jeremy was awesome and made our Las Vegas trip the most memorable ever.  We had a group of 7 people and of course we all had different opinions on what to do and when and how much to spend.  I emailed a few other companies along with this one and out of all of them Jeremy was the most helpful, was constantly emailing back when I emailed him or text him, didn't seem to mind when I asked a million times to requote and had the best price.  He delivered exactly what he said he would, was on time even when we were late, and was very patient :).  I can't thank him enough for helping us have the best Las Vegas trip ever.  We will definitely use his services from now on.  I used a different company before and I am glad they never returned my call which forced me to look elsewhere and find Jeremy.  Thank you!!"
1,"This was my first time at Cafe Boa and I happened upon it while looking for a late morning breakfast place. Bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry. No butter or jam was offered. We had to ask for it. \n\nOne of my big pet peeves: memorizing orders. I'd rather you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up. Of course our server did. He forgot our orange juice and I had to ask for it. I was really in the mood for what was advertised on the menu as \""Fresh Squeezed OJ\"". A large glass of OJ was brought to the table but if it was Tropicana, they'd be doing at least better than they were. It wasn't fresh squeezed. I asked our server about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender, etc. and sounded surprised. Big mistake to be blaming others. So he finally brings back fresh squeezed and it's a glass about a third the size of of the original.\n\nThe food overall was tasty and hot. No complaints there. Service seems to be on par with the other reviews. Our chucklehead was no exception. When he did bring the bill, it was only a total and no itemized bill. Had to ask for that too. I wonder if he'll figure out he'll save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time?"
2,"I was completely surprised at the detail and execution of exhibits. I had never heard of this museum before and am glad I went. Learning about the Mob and especially the law enforcement strategies to take them down was fascinating. Toward the end of the tour it did seem to glorify these criminals a bit much, and all of the pop culture items at the end kind of left a sour taste in my mouth.  I mean, as great as it is, it's a museum about criminals."
1,"Same old, same old... my GF and I came here because we had the munchies and didn't feel like going into a noisy casino.  They have a sign out front advertising they had Wi-Fi.  But it didn't work.  :("
2,"this place is cool, cold beer, food is not great, but they do have OTB"
3,"Really tasty Vietnamese food. The place is very clean and the service was great. I really enjoyed my lunch and for eight dollars including tip, the price can't be beat.\n\nI had the pho with eye of round and it was flavorful, hot, and came with all of the expected herbs and toppings.\n\nI can give this place a solid four stars very easily."
0,"I went in to get an oil change and they sold me on radiator services as well. The very next day, my car started seizing coming out of stop lights and signs. I returned to JL and stated what was happening after my visit. The assistant manager was rude and told me that the car seizing had nothing to do with what they had done. Upon further inspection, they noticed the radiator was bone dry. They were the ones who flushed the radiator only 5 days before. So, they forgot to replace the radiator fluid. Sure enough, I have not experienced the car seizing since. I will not go here again......that is after I speak with a manager."
0,"This place used to be amazing, but now not even close. Everything used to be fresh and now the new owners use all pre made products that are not even quality. I used to eat her all the time and no longer. Ya maybe they fixed up the place but what they should have done was put that money towards the food the served. We miss the old owners!!"
2,"I'm sorry. I really am. I wanted to love this place. Not that I think donuts are anything to write home about, and I don't think a restaurant that stays open past 3 should be called a brunch club, but that's just me and the weird things that bother me.\n\nOur service was ok, an over-friendly waitress (they exist, I'm sorry. She was a bit inappropriate) And an order of ravioli that as horribly cooked. Turns out they don't make it themselves (but do get it locally). Traded it in for a sandwich and soup, which were both delicious.\n\nBut they didn't offer us any comp for the horrible first dish. The waitress even told us the chef tried it and agreed it was bad. I just feel like to get a customer to come back you should do SOMETHING nice. A donut for crying out loud? SOMETHING? But alas. Wine was meh (would have liked to see more of a selection or a cheap house wine). I feel like I'm being generous with 3 stars but I also believe in second chances and maybe a weird night/weird waitress. Bummer!"
1,"I am a systems/network admin so I've had to deal with Cox in both a home and business environment.  I'm also familiar with ISPs in other cities and states.\n\nHaving played around with both cable and DSL for home internet, I will give Cox my business... reluctantly.  Compared to the only viable alternative to cable (DSL) I have had less issues with cable than DSL in Vegas.  There is wireless here in Vegas but it isn't stable (subject to too many variables) and is cost prohibitive (as far as I've seen, better for businesses).  \n\nThe issue that really gets me is the price, which as of this posting they just increased with no warning or extra value.  Compared to other providers in other regions it is 20-30 bucks more expensive for 25/5 service.  When I lived in Portland, OR, my bill with Comcast (also a not highly rated provider) was 50 bucks less for TV, DVR, internet AND I had faster internet compared to what I had.  I dropped my TV service from Cox and went with DirectTV for better price and more value.\n\nFor businesses, you fair a bit better in service.  Their reps are usually pretty good but they will still bend you over a table for costs but it isn't in the reps control.  For the price I pay for for 100mb fiber service, I could pay half as much elsewhere.\n\nSprint/Embarq/CenturyLink whatever they call their company this month for DSL is worse in terms of service and reliability.  Their support is even worse (though their field techs know what they are doing).  They don't offer the same rate plans as Cox and max out at 10mb for home for most people though they say they have plans up to 40mb and hide the upload rate (which is only 1.5mb even for the big plans).  For my home needs, I can't even consider them because of the pitiful upload rate.  \n\nAs a business, I've never had an order placed with them provisioned right the first time.  They will eventually figure it out but still.  I swear that the reps, provisioning and field all have different databases that don't talk to each other.  Their internal communication between departments is bad.  If you can get a good rep, that will be half the battle.  I've had more outages with them than I've had with Cox.  Although Cox has been known to split a node and not notify their business customers that their static IPs changed over night.\n\nAs for Clear for home wireless - avoid it.  There are too many variables that can interfere with wireless so it isn't going to be reliable.  If you can get a wireless engineer to come out and test for LOS, signal strength (receiving and transmitting) then you might be OK.  Haven't tried it myself though for home.  As a business I have used wireless ISPs in this town and have had mixed results.  Avoid Airband (formerly Sparkplug) as a business.\n\nI have managed to find a worse ISP though but it isn't in Vegas thank god.  AT&T (used them in Reno).  Ya, lets just say that if they were to catch on fire I'd be there to roast hot dogs and marshmallows.\n\nSo to sum it up, for home Cox wins out over CenturyLink in service, reliability and capability but is overpriced (so is CenturyLink).  We are all still screwed by lack of good competition and choice in this town (bad or worse)."
1,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. \n\nI went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).\n\nThe presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2\""x 2\""-- a sad display. \n\nThe chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. \n\nThis was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! \n\nWe left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness."
4,"I saw a review that likened Gadzooks to Chipotle.  As I made it through the line and their staff assembled my lunch, I can see how that comparison can be made - in process alone.  \n\nI love that they have limited items on the menu (basically, enchilada, taco, tortilla soup) but then there's an option explosion for what you put in them.  I had a green chili pork enchilada and a bison enchilada.  Both were terrific. It was the best bison I've ever had, in fact.  The house-smashed guacamole was delicious also.\n\nI thought I was smart by getting there at 11:30 (avoiding the noon rush) but they were already very busy.  I got the last parking space and the next to last interior table.  Thankfully the tables seemed to turn quickly and the line moved in the same way.  There are misters on the patio if that's your only course of action.   \n\nI will certainly come back and I'll bring friends."
3,"Great location. I live in city center so I frequently walk down and get a milkshake or burger to-go. Prices are a bit higher than average, a few dollars more compared to other locations, but that's expected since it's on the strip. \n\nFries and onion rings are not great. Don't get the side combo. It costs more and you literally get two small onion rings.\n\nTry the pistachio milkshake!"
0,"This place is a nightmare . The first two IPAs recommended to me by the server were apparently out. She recommended them and them came with the reply of unfortunately these are out . Her third recommendation wasn't even an IPA. Then when we ordered our food they were out of the item my friend ordered . The nachos a friend ordered were brought out 15 minutes before our food came out . Then when we asked for ketchup, we were told they were all out of it ? What kind of bar runs out of ketchup ? The bus boys were spanking the girls with the same wet towels they use to wipe tables down , and the manager was a complete fool. Our server was very sweet and obviously embarrassed of all the poor things this restaurant had going for it.  Honestly, the bus boy was my biggest complaint . Specifically the tool bag spanking all the girls in the middle of the restaurant and poking their stomachs . Pathetic . We will never come back to this place . Which is truly unfortunate because the seating and abundance of TVs is great for sports."
2,"Cheap, old rooms, good location. They charge the resort fee (internet for 1 device, pool, gym) $29 per room even if you don't use it.\n\nThe poker room had some really nice dealers and pit bosses and the game seemed pretty friendly even at 2am. The rest of the casino seemed pretty sad and didn't seem nice until we wandered into Paris, which is connected to it."
2,"Do you like to play Bingo?  Well, you can't do it on the strip or you can't do it downtown.  As soon as you get off the strip, you can find a number of Bingo Halls.  Red Rock's Bingo is one of the better ones.  It is modern, clean and offers electronic boards to make your bingo experience a fun and less stressful one.  The nicest thing is that they make a smoker area so you don't have to breathe their nasty second hand smoke.  Make sure you check the times they are playing and have a more relaxing gambling experience."
1,"Don't be deceived anymore. This place just isn't what it used to be. Not by a long shot. I've been coming here for the last 9 years or so. It had been about 2-3 years since I had been to vegas (moved to Macau) I visited last night and I cant explain how disappointed I was in the quality and taste of food now compared to before. \n\nFlying in from Macau, I thought the first place I will stop at seeing how my hotel is in the Venetian will be Canonita, I had been craving the Chili Relleno for years. Our server asked if we had been here before we said yes. We placed our orders, got a taco platter for appetizer, margaritas, chille relleno, and the barbacoa. The barbacoa and margaritas were pretty much the same, but the taco platter was changed for the worse. And the relleno was just plain disgusting now. It went from being their best dish in my opinion to the worst. I'm really not sure what happened to this place, it looks a lot more corporate now and just was lacking these authentic flavors that it possessed in previous years. \n\nThe quality has gone down a lot and we dont know if thats because there is some new chefs or if the chefs just stopped trying. The taco platter took off at least one taco from the previous years and replaced it with \""carnitas.\"" The carnitas tasted like plastic and had the texture of it as well. I took one bite and its obvious they load it with that salsa on top to give it all the flavor because the meat was lacking taste. \n\nOverall im giving it a 2 star rating now because the margaritas were fine (hard to mess up a margarita) and the barbacoa for keeping the same recipe. But honestly, we wont be dining here again until they bring back the delicious relleno with nuts and fruits inside. I cant be the only one who thinks this new rendition is disgusting. There is way better choices when it comes to Mexican food in Vegas."
4,This plac is amazing.  We went during restaurant week and had a wonderful three course dinner.  I have celiac disease and they were very accomodating.  Their dinner rolls are gluten free and so delicious.  They sent me home with four rolls.
4,"\""Nobody knows the truffles I've seen.\"" \n George Lang\nThis shop is beautiful. Perfectly displayed, perfectly packaged product surrounded me as I went from shelf to shelf admiring the amazing pastries and chocolates. The truffles were beautiful with a perfect bite to them. Everything in the store looked incredibly edible. I ordered two scoops of Gellato since it was over 100 degrees and we were about to hit the strip again. The Mango was fantastic and the Coconut was truly amazing. Prices were very fair for everything that I picked up. Would definitely return when back in sin city."
3,"They had us @ the apps!  The only problem about this place is everybody around got bread and for some reason we got shorted. Other than that great food, great drinks, and great atmosphere.   We will be back!"
2,"The only reason I stepped inside this mini mart was because of the Krispy Krunchy  Chicken sign outside. So they have a small stand inside selling Cajun fried chicken. I got a 3 piece, comes with a biscuit. The chicken was decent, good flavor, not  greasy, I would get it again. The biscuit was horrible though, I think it may have been sitting too long. Oh well. The cost was about 5$. Staff was friendly."
2,"As far as I remember, this place is pretty good. A pretty unique restaurant for Champaign. Definitely sit at one of the tables where the food is cooked in front of you, it's basically a requirement.. or something. \n\nThe food was consistently pretty good but nothing hugely fantastic and not a whole lot of traditional dishes, unfortunately. \n\nNever had sushi here"
2,"I think that Pick Up Stix uses much better quality ingredients than Panda Express and many other Asian fast food chains and is fairly affordable given the quality. Their lunch special is a particularly good deal - you get a choice between 3-4 specific meat dishes, a choice of wontons or egg rolls, a choice between different rices or chow mein, and a drink for $6.99. The House Special Chicken has a really flavorful sauce and is great combined with sauteed veggies (for $1 more), and the crab wontons are much better than ones I've had at many Asian restaurants that have kind of a fishy or overly creamy filling. However, echoing what some people have already said, the noodle dishes are not great here and should probably be avoided."
2,All hype.. \n\nThe crowd is rich old geezers and broke college kids on ecstacy. Or Molly I think..\n\nThe line for guestlist is super long. But thank god for connections lol! I would hate to be drunk and in that line.\n\nThe club was ok.. huge.. I love the hip hop room on the 4th level!\n\nI would honestly rather go to another club with less hype.. \n\nI want to try out their competition next weekend.. The Light! I heard thins are better there..
3,"This location is consistently busy. If big sales are on, I wouldn't even bother trying unless you are prepared for war with moms and toddlers. The selection here is usually good and shelves seem well stocked."
0,"Finally was able to go in and have the facial I was waiting for. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing.. You get a first time deal and that price is good.. Their normal pricing is the same price as the high end resorts so since they don't have the same amenities I don't think it wld be worth the normal pricing. After I got home from my facial I noticed I still had foundation on my face. I took a remover wipe and got foundation off AFTER my facial! I couldn't believe it. They shld have removed my makeup properly before my facial. Very disappointed. I emailed them to let them know why I didn't reschedule because they called me to.. So I thought they wld appreciate the feedback on why I wldnt be returning again. I never heard back from them. I won't be returning for any services unfortunately, I really had wanted to."
1,"I was in Charlotte for a conference, and always noticed how busy Vida looked when I passed by. We decided to try it for our last night in town. We ordered the guacamole, which was not the best I have had, but was pretty decent. We also had margaritas, which were nothing to write home about. My main course, the shrimp and crab enchiladas with a side of roasted corn and plantain/black bean mash, was delicious! \n\nHad it only been for the food, I would probably rate Vida 3 or 4 stars. However, the service was horrible! The food took FOREVER to arrive. The chips and salsa took about 15 minutes after the server finally told us they were being brought out. The guacamole, which we ordered at the same time, took another 20 minutes or so to arrive. Drinks for some reason took at least 10 or 15 minutes to come out. The waitress made comments about our wait time but never once apologized or tried to offer something to make it better. She blamed it on the restaurant being new. \""We've only been open for 2 weeks so things are a little backed up.\"" Regardless of who's fault it was. hers or the kitchen's, she didn't try to rectify the situation. Even when getting the check, we asked for two separate checks and because the manager took $2 off 4 out of our 5 drinks, it took her three times to get our check divided correctly (food on one, drinks on the other should not be that difficult!)\n\nAll in all, decent-good food, bad service. Hopefully the other servers are better!"
1,"We've tried this restaurant twice during the last three weeks. It's somewhat expensive for breakfast but we thought it worth it the first time we visited. The first time the food and service were terrific and today it was barely mediocre-to the point we almost walked out.\n\nThe sign of a great restaurant is seamless service and the quantity and timing of the kitchen's output on a busy day-not an average day. Stay away from this place on a holiday or when the place is very busy and people are waiting for tables.\n\nThe kitchen could not keep pace with demand today, the  new waiter dumped food in my lap and had to be told to comp me something, our order was wrong, came in stages, and portions were cold and undercooked. Even people around us were aghast and some waited for their breakfast orders for 45 mins. The table next to us sat for 15 mins without their order being taken. While all of the servers were polite, some of the servers are very experienced and some are newbies and not well trained, which is management's fault. Father's Day is a day to to be well staffed.\n\nI'll be trying somewhere new. Today's experience was unacceptable."
0,Umm we were staying at the Palazzo and they said we still had to pay $20 to get into a club that looks hella dead inside??? You must be on crack Mr. Bouncer guy that needs to get the stick outta your ass. I ain't paying for that shit! \n\nI'd rather walk my ass to the V Bar where it's free and play better music.
0,"My family and I have been patrons of Richardson's & the Rokerij for over 10 years. The service has always been so so, with condescending waiters, etc. but the food usually made up for the bad service. I mean we even returned several times after my sister found a rubber band in her pasta Heidi and still had to pay for the dish. However, our past few experiences have been sub-par. Service is worse than ever and the food does not make up for it anymore. It is either too spicy or severely overcooked and dry. It will be a while before we return!!"
4,"Place is awesome. I'm a huge fan of gyros. I have tried the lamb, beef, and chicken gyro. All amazing. If you love traditional Greek food, this place is for you. Staff is friendly, service is quick, price is cheap, food is bomb. A++"
4,"Attempted to get out of the house and pressed the garage door button this Monday morning after Xmas day with no luck.  Here I am thinking I could manually slide the door with ease ended almost breaking my back.  I sat for a moment and wondered. . . .   did Santa took my super powers away this Xmas?  little that I know, that all this time there was this metal spring that assist the sliding of this 200+ LB of hunk'n piece of metal that I called garage door.   Spring is broke and now I stuck.\n\nLucky for me Express Garage Door Service came to the rescue.  Brian the garage door guru came by with in 30 mins of my distress call with no extra charge.  he masterfully replaced the both springs, pulley bearings and rollers.  Yes, new silicon rollers that cuts down the sliding noise by 95%.  My dogs can testify to this, highly recommended for those late night sneaks.  :)   and by the way all of this was done with in 45 mins at a very affordable price.  Thanks Brian!"
3,"What is there left to say when 653 other Yelpers have already spilled the beans about the Earl of Sandwich? There was only one thing left to do which was to see what the hype was all about myself. \n\nThe place is located inside the Planet Hollywood across from the sports book. It's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened Hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. The Earl just might be your savior.\n\nFor a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. There are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the Hawaiian bbq. Of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (I recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth. \n\nThe word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.\n\nOn our most recent trip to Sin City, we stopped by Earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at PH and so it was always a short walk away. On a random note, I would like to state that for some odd reason I enjoyed the sandwiches from Earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. Perhaps it was the hangover munchies?\n\nGive the Earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code."
4,"I would call this little gem one of Edinburgh's hidden secrets: although judging by all the positive comments on here perhaps it's not that well hidden? From the outside it looks like a ropey kebab shop, but step inside and you'll be treated to some of the best Indian food in town. The naan breads are big soft pillows and the currys are bursting with flavour (yes, even the korma!)"
2,"I checked out this place purely because it's location was the shortest distance to travel . Upon entering I walked in at the same time as this really old gentleman. We were greeted upon entry and carded. \nNow I get being safe rather then sorry but I am 30 years old and the other guy had to be pushing 60+ . So it took me by surprise. This isn't my first time coming to a adult store however it's the most uncomfy vibe I have ever gotten from one.\n\nMy personality is the type that when I get flustered I make jokes so I called myself old and pretended to be flattered. I forget for other females who may be older than I am it's offensive to call myself OLD because that makes them ancient . I quickly had to go on the defense explaining that I was joking around . It just was strange.\n\nI got a chance to walk about 5 steps before a male employee came up to me while I'm checking out this toy that you can create your own sperm for it to shoot out . I am laughing and he says \""excuse the mess we are remodeling\"" . Now I am all about customer service but I truly just was there to browse for any sale items  . I don't like being bombarded with tons of questions or shadows.  \n\nI have no shame in wanting to spice things up in the bedroom but I also don't really want to feel like I am a criminal that might steal or someone who needs help picking out xxx store. I'm guessing the staff is encouraged to engage every customer and to up sell products I just wish they would learn some tact as to when to use the charm. \nIf I was there for something specific I would of been able to get in and get out really fast because they have plenty of people working the sales floor and everyone was really nice.\n\nThe selection of items they have available and cleanliness of this store was good. They have everything spread out all over the store though so I didn't care for the layout .Price wise they are overpriced . Which is common at most adult stores I've been to but this was my first Vegas adult store so it's hard to compare . \n\nI'm notorious for being really cheap so I typically order my adult items online . I did find a few items on sale but the clearance section was very tiny. While I was looking at that rack the lady who carded me came (no name tag in sight )back and asked what brought me in today . I advised her that I was just looking. She started to try to probe me for more info. It almost felt like she was asking my fantasies. Point blank I ended up telling her I just want to browse and asked her to take the stuff I already decided to purchase up at the counter.\n\nThe last area I checked out was the lube /condom/edible/stimulant shelf. I didn't like the selection of that at all.  I ended up just going to the very front of the store and browsing the trial size lubes. They only had two different brands and as I was trying to read the info off the tiny little packets I was yet again questioned. This time though it was a wonderful chick named Jaime. She was sweet and knowledgeable about the products . She advised about her personal favorites and earned herself a tip by being genuine..\n\nYes I said TIP. They have a jar at the register that is soliciting tips. That's usually a pet peeve  of mine but all three employees i came across were at least trying to work hard for their tips. Be warned though tips are cash only you can't add it to your card.\n\n\nI'd recommend this place to someone who isn't super shy or has any shame about going to a adult store. I can see it going wrong in so many ways for anyone who has shame. I also don't think id bring my boyfriend there because the staff would end up butting in on any convos and would kill the mood. \n\n I will make my way to this place again only\nIf one of the fancy organic lubes merit a full bottle purchase. I ended up spending around $55 on the sale items I got. My favorite was the candy whip I got for 3.99. The look on my boyfriends face that I got a candy wip was priceless. The selection of bdsm stuff was a whole wall but it was sectioned by company brand instead of product type and I lost patience trying to find the prices. I don't like the placement or their price tags or their layout but I went with three stars because it was A-OK..."
2,"Is it me or does this place totally smell like a used cat box when you walk in? The prices are about the same as the other Mexican supermarkets around Vegas which to me are higher than some markets. If you need regular type grocery items (milk, butter, etc) I highly recommend going to another store like Smith's as the prices on those items are better there. \n\nOtherwise clean and neat claustrophobic aisles."
0,"I hate to do this as I go there a lot and I really do like it most of the time. My experience this morning though wasn't good . I stopped by on my way to work there were a few cars in the drive thru so I figured I could go inside. There was only one person ahead of me and she was already being helped. The girls working were nice and apologized for the wait..but then I kept waiting and waiting and all I wanted to order was a bagel and an Iced Tea. One of the girls was startled as they now had like 5 cars in the drive thru and in addition to making coffee one of the girls started cracking eggs for the breakfast sandwiches they serve.\n\n5 minutes had gone by and the woman in front of me still didn't have her complete order and I hadn't even been able to give my order, so I left. By that time there was 2 more cars in the drive through so, 7 total and another woman behind me who hadn't even been acknowledged.\nI went to the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf instead. Got to have my morning Iced Tea. I feel bad for the employees, they were obviously trying but there were only 2 of them and now that they make more than coffee it seems they should have more staff at peak times..."
3,I really enjoyed going to Fat Tuesday. It was a good deal I thought got the travel mug for $15.00 with the extra shot (190 Octane was awesome) and seriously about a half hour after I drank the drink I was fucked up. The room was spinning when I was in that casino playing.
4,"Inexpensive and quality Mexican food! \n\nThis is what I'm talking about!  I frequent this place and order either the Chicken Burrito or Three Chicken Tacos. \n\nThey are so generous in the chicken in the burrito, you could just eat the burrito itself for lunch and be full.  I love their green salsa as well.\n\nIf you order three chicken tacos, they do not skimp on the chicken and pour on the lettuce and cheeses. \n\nI've had other food here in the past (carne asada burrito, chicken chimichanga, Super beef nachos, California Burrito, beef and chicken tortas.\n\nThe point is, come in hungry, come out happy.\n\nThis location is the best one I've been to yet in Las Vegas.  There is a reason I keep coming back here for sure. :)"
0,I honestly don't know why I keep coming here (other than it being close to work) The service is terrible and they never have enough people working. There is no reason a smoothie should take 20 minutes to make.
0,"Don't shop here.  We go to Vegas twice a year.  Don't know why but we always seem to end up at the Forum Shops and stopping at this Fields of Dreams shop (more like Fields of Disaster).  Our last trip there, my son and his friend wanted to get a souvenier.  They're big baseball fans.  My son's friend accidentally bumped into a display upstairs and a framed/signed plaque fell over and the glass broke.  The two rudest salespeople demanded we pay for the broken plaque at $129.99.  Are they out of their minds?  We demanded to talk to the owner, but he was off and too busy to deal with it, leaving two dumb girls to call the police.  Police came and we explained the whole situation and showed them the flimsy display.   Needless to say, we did not pay for that plaque.  I guess when you have two dumb, rude people working at a store the best thing to do is to bring in somebody with a brain.  I guess this is their way of moving inventory.  They're just lucky nobody got hurt."
3,"I think Steve Wynn is a genius when it comes to hotels! He makes hotel, luxury, & relaxation go hand & hand (& hand). Las Vegas is around the corner for me, LA-LV only 4hrs, that's nothing! I've stayed at many hotels- I don't stay committed to one place, come on it's vegas, experience everything-even the hotels. Saying that, this is one of my favorite LV places to stay. I've been here twice & both times it's a ball! I feel like royalty! I don't even want to leave the room, because it's so much better than home & outside world, but I have to return to reality & eventually eat. If room service wasn't so pricey (along with the hotel prices), I do everything in the room; eat, sleep, relax & be in pure happiness! I've stayed in the regular Resort Suites; when it first open, and it was a pleasant surprise. Because I've stayed at Wynn Hotel & didn't think he (Steve Wynn) could top that beauty, but they did with Encore! I gave a minus for this beauty because we went during the soft opening and there were some issues; like messy walls (smudge markings) the bathroom had the dilemmas- temperature of water & cleanliness, but it was worked out and the remainder of the trip was good\n\nWould I come back? Sure, if I started to poop out money and didn't have \""adult responsibilities\"" to take care of, because it can get expensive staying here so we'll have to see if I can afford coming back. It is a place to experience, even if you're just walking to the casino or club/lounge."
2,The food here is pretty good. The ingredients seem fresh. I would probably compare them to Quiznos (maybe a little better).\n\nThe service is average. The prices are a little higher than normal.\n\nI probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Just an average sub shop.
4,"My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.\n\nAnywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.\n\nI ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.\n\nThe chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.\n\nIn Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.\n\nBIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!"
0,I can't believe the nasty and ghetto things occurring at this store.  Wear gloves!! I wouldn't recommend you walk away from this micky D's
2,"the dryers kinda suck, 4 dry cycles for 2 pair of jeans and some shirts/socks? ridiculous.\non the other hand, very clean. they have TVs, it's air conditioned and there are carts available.\n\ni probably won't do my laundry here again, but i may take advantage of their wash/dry/fold service for $.89/pound."
2,"Decent food. Not really authentic Thai food. You can pick your level of spiciness, which is good."
1,"Very disappointed to pay for covered parking and end up with large amounts of bird poop on the roof, windshield and one side of my car. The attendant refused to discount the bill. Will be parking elsewhere next time."
3,"A girl's gotta fuel up before embarking on a long shopping expedition. Thank you, Stack, for providing the much needed fuel! I enjoyed a heavenly egg white omelette at Stack along with a soy latte (soy milk is a rare find in Vegas). The potatoes/home fries were prepared brilliantly; seasoned to perfection and not at all greasy or overwhelming. The cheese was delicately melt atop the omelette which I've never seen before. It made for the perfect distribution of cheese taste. \n\nThe bartender/waiter (we had to sit at the bar) was attentive and thoughtful. He went in the back to dig up soy milk for me and provided us with to-go cups of ice water to withstand the rigors of our shopping trip in Ceasar's Forum. (He offered, we didn't ask).  \n\nOverall, it was a wonderful non-gourmet experience and by far superior to any other fast, American style restaurant we tried while in Vegas. Highly recommended!"
0,"The restaurant seemed nice at first appearance.  Appetizer -chicken potstickers were great.  The bowl size  wasn't too big. It was $9.99 a bowl  (dinner)and make bottom less bowl  ( repeat bowls) was another 4 dollars.  Not  a lot once cooked.  Could have cooked a little longer as broccoli was still completely hard and not even warm.   And the initial bowl is small.  For family of 4, it was expensive  for amount of food.  I was very excited for the restaurant to open up,  but overall  disappointed.  Felt like we rush thru the  entire process and  rushing us out the door.  Won't go again"
3,Today we ventured over to Geri's again for a Philly... I ordered a chicken and mushroom philly w/ beer battered mushrooms and cream soda... my son had hamburger ... Fries and mozzarella sticks and root beer... He said best ever... I encourage everyone to try there philly's best I've ever had in Vegas and the music reminds me of when I was growing up... Carpenter's... Beatles... Barry Manilow..       \n\nI love this little place... its a family own business that has been around since the early 70s... Go and try the food... Very very good
2,"Chose this location close to home to celebrate a parents' birthday.  Was pretty excited about it after reading a few Yelp reviews that the new owners had really improved the place...I wasn't that impressed...\n\nI really enjoyed the decor/ambiance and the many beers they had on tap.  I think it would be a great place to meet up for an after work drink or to watch an afternoon Badger basketball game.\n\nIt was not a great place however, for dinner.  We started with chicken nachos for an appetizer.  They took way to long to arrive and when they came, they were cold!  So cold that much of the cheese had not melted!!!\n\nThe rest of the meal was fine but the the service continued to be pretty slow.  I would say the tortilla chicken soup was the highlight of the meal.  All in all a little disapointing..."
0,"I go to Carrabbas frequently and this time happened to be the worst service experience I've had at a restaurant in recent memory. Server disappeared, manager was rude and the entire experience sucked!"
2,Good fun for kids at adventure dome.\nNo place to sit for non players \nNot possible to sit and eat com comfortably.
1,"Came for lunch and the service wasn't great.  The food was OK.  I had the sashimi Benito box. The miso dressing on my salad was watery and bland. I guess they forgot the seaweed salad I ordered.  I told the waitress and she didn't even apologize or ask if I wanted it.  When she brought the bill, she said \""I took it off the bill for you\"" with a big smile, like she did me a favor.  Of course she took it off the bill, I never got it."
2,"When I was living in Madison, there was somewhere I preferred more than Capitol Centre, but I didn't do all my shopping at the other place. Capitol Centre was within walking distance and was right off the square. It is open 24 hours, except for a deep cleaning on Sunday nights which  I can appreciate. They had very cheap bananas, but all other fresh produce was a bit more expensive than I would have expected for a non-organic selection. It is a basic grocery store, nothing too fancy otherwise. One of the greatest perks of this grocery store is the fact that they do delivery, which was nice when I was buying more than I would like to bike. They are efficient and were always at my house within the hour."
3,"My favorite Italian/Tuscan food in town.  I think it's far better than Allesia's in Mesa.  The lobster bisque is the best soup I've ever had in my life.  Not expensive, but reasonable priced based on the food quality.  Good wine menu and something for everybody.  Take the fam or make it a special night out with the wife.  This place will accommodate any occasion."
4,Honestly...This place has the longest wait for tables and food.....And it was worth it. Our waitress was awesome and eager!! Harley was the main reason we will be back. She kept the coffee flowing and had the best attitude. This review could have gone either way and her service was worth the 5 stars!!
0,"My son and I ate dinner here on 12/23/10. \n\nThe original plan was to buffet at the Bellagio or Wynn but then I came up with the idea that since the man-child hadn't been to Vegas since he was about 8, it would be better if he tried out the more modest venues in stuffing-one's-face so he wouldn't be too \""spoiled\"" or something like that in these days of particular hardship. (Yeah, ok, well whatever).  He's a good sport and agreed to try this place since reviews were mixed and not too horrible. And their \""Steak/Scampi\"" Thursday night special also helped convince him.\n\nLine wasn't too long. Signed up for their players club so dinner was about $18 each. Friendly, quick server to take our drink orders. \n\nThe \""scampi\"" was.....interesting. It wasn't awful but it weren't scampi e'ther. It was in some kind of bland creamy sauce which garlic had never met. Best to eat it first and fast because as it cools down .....well, just eat it as soon as possible.\n\nSteak - the 14-y-o man-child can grill a skirt steak that would be about 15x better than what was served here. It was tough, and full of fat and gristle. \n\nSalads - green salad was rusty and wilted. Didn't try any others but as far as presentation - very lacking.\n\nPizza was plentiful - just ok - like frozen grocery store quality\n\nMexican entres - looked bad, very bad, only tried the taquitos. Blah and if there was filling in there it was miniscule - don't try if you have dentures\n\nMashed potatoes - ok\n\nFried chicken - the man-child only rarely is allowed to eat fried chicken although he loves it - he excitedly ate a piece and that was the only piece he wanted. \n\nDesserts - if you LOVE pudding, then this is potentially your heaven. Didn't try it but there is PLENTY available in a couple of flavors.\nBanana cream pie - one bite - stop\nLemon meraingue pie - best thing that night.\n\nAgain, our server was very good, kept me in ice tea and took away dirty dishes in good time."
0,"The only thing was good about this place was the (mature) cashier very nice. The fried soft shell crab and the combo shrimp and catfish  with fries was nasty.I know you're saying how can fried food be nasty??? I wish i could tell you,but it was."
0,"I purchased two salads to serve with Stromboli..both were wilted, orange (old)..threw them away"
1,"Even though I didn't feel like I was \""floating in a magical world of crystals\"", nor was I mesmerized by the world's (allegedly) largest crystal chandelier, I did find this place visually impressive. However, all the razzle-dazzle cannot disguise the unfortunate shortcomings of The Chandelier. \nFor starters, the service (this word in itself is a very generous overstatement) is incredibly slow here. It took almost 30 minutes (sadly, we measured) for our cocktail waitress to approach us on a relatively slow evening when half of the floor was still empty. Then, it took an other half hour for three drinks to arrive. The second round was just as slow as the first. Then, to make things worse, I ordered some water. I know, I must have been out of my mind to request bottled water and our drowsy waitress made sure we knew how appalled she was by this senseless act. At first, she totally ignored my request and after a friendly reminder, she just threw a large bottle of water on the table. Without glasses. I guess she really couldn't entertain the idea of needing to serve plain old water; or it's just a really unusual situation and she wasn't sure how to handle it. Or maybe she was floating in an enchanted world of crystals... and occasionally disappeared into her own magical mindscape. \n(For her sake, I hope it's the latter.)"
1,This location has some serious AC issues.  It's either 20 degrees too warm or 20 degrees to cold.  Customers all talk about it but nothing seems to ever get done about it.  The building is really 2 separate rooms.  1 is where you order your drinks and the other is where the sitting area is.  It feels like 2 completely different temperature zones.  They would benefit from a visit from someone to fix their thermostat issues.
4,"I have visited this location twice, both times everything was delicious and service was great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone their cakes are absolutely fantastic."
4,I'm a figure competitor and personal trainer and have had great results with both myself and my clients with dr. Jain's food sensitivity alcat testing. no cookie cutter diets! Great fat loss results in record time!
1,"Starting with the good and ending with the bad. The salon is well decorated and had a nice atmosphere. I purchased the Groupon for an all over color and haircut. My stylist, Mae, did a consultation with me where I told her I only wanted to cut off 1 inch and add a few layers throughout my hair. Well she ended up chopping off all my hair, more than 1 inch, and gave me the worst haircut I have ever received. Even the bangs she gave me are terrible. Her lack of experience, she told me she had only been at this salon for a year, reflected in the haircut I received. The color came out ok, however, it was darker than what I wanted. On a positive note, Mae was very sweet and had a warm personality. I just wish she would have listened to what I wanted. I am very unhappy and will not be returning in the future. I guess you take a gamble with your hair when you purchase a Groupon. It is just hair and it will grow back, but now I know what a bad haircut FEELS like."
3,"Indian food is almost always expensive, so I won't even bother to complain about that.  But the food here is good and they accomodated a special request, so for that Copper gets high marks.  \n\nThe SAMOSAs are as expected.  Potato and pea wrapped in a nice fried crunchy dough. The chutneys are tasty.  Nothing out of the ordinary or that you couldn't get anywhere else (or make at home).\n\nCHICKEN CHETTINADU is not for the faint of heart (or palette).  My colleague was warned that the base was spicy, but she scoffed and said she loved spicy food.  Fast forward 20 minutes and there was sweat dripping from her forehead and her eyes and nose were watering.  I tasted the gravy, and thought it was great, but I didn't try to eat a bowl full of it.  \n\nAll entrees are served family style, with rice added to the table.  We also got a bit of naan free but ordered extra with the meal.  No salt or pepper on the table, but they're happy to bring it if you ask.\n\nThe ZESTY VEGETABLE BHAJI side was interesting.  Long julienned pieces of mixed vegetables, including beets, all mixed with a dry spice rub.  \n\nThe traditional vegetarian menu offers PANEER MAKHAWALA, which is a red gravy similar to tikka masala or butter gravy.  Very rich and flavorful but not too spicy. I asked to substitue cauliflower / gobi for the paneer, and the chef nicely complied.  Overall this was a very tasty and well balanced dish.  \n\nThe service was great, and the interior of the restaurant (located in a very old rehabbed house) is unique.  \n\nFor people looking for more Indian options, try the University area.  It's full of great Indian hole-in-the-walls.  My personal faves: Persis (everything is good, but the Gobi 65 is amazing), Tulips (varied weekend buffet and good a la carte ordering) and Passage to India (great gobi manchurian and weekend/lunch buffet)."
0,"Nice looking place.  Staff is friendly enough.  \n\nI won't be eating here however.  As a chef myself I know what food storage containers look like.  When the bar tender left the bar, to clean the ladies bath room with a cambro from the kitchen with soapy water in it I wanted to throw up. Not only did the lady serving drinks to me go to scrub the ladies toilet but she used food storage container as a bucket.  Totally gross.   Won't be back here ever."
3,"The nemo blue interior helps with the workout. Anytime fitness places could be open from $30k to $100k. This looks to be in the upper section.good equipment, showers, and healthy vending options. Diverse crowd.They also have water massage machine. Free one time use with Google maps offer. No WiFi password or network written on visible place inside the building. Lil dirty restroom and showers."
2,"Went just 2 days ago, was expecting greatness and was let down.  The things I enjoyed...prime rib (pretty good but the outside was chewy and had to get many slices to satisfy my appetite), shrimp cocktail, eggs benedict, cheese blintz, smoked salmon and some of the desserts (they were just ok). Didn't like duck leg, leg of lamb, or the lack of seafood, no lobster, or crab or fish that I wanted, also they started clearing the selections so I felt like we had less and less everytime I went back. Also Deb felt sick for the rest of the day and next morning most likely related to our food here. Maybe it was bad timing @230?!"
2,"It is with great sadness and a deep sense of loss that I must amend my previous rating of what was once the best sushi in all of Vegas. Once rated a 5 star, it now lies more around the 3 star range.  \n\nTo be sure, the crowds are still lining up for a seat at this one-time fine establishment, but one wonders if the restaurant's popularity may have contributed to its current downfall.\n\nSince my last review of Yama, the place has certainly gotten a lot busier. But management has not responded well to the rush of new business. \n\nHere is a few things that have gone very wrong at Yama:\n* The fish is no longer fresh. Rather than cutting the fish from the filet as it is ordered, they pre-cut several hundreds of pieces at a time - and the quality of the fish has suffered immensely, with most pieces having a soft, slimy film covering them.\n* The place is way too crowded. Rather than focusing on a great dining experience, management has decided to try and cram as many people as possible along the bar and around the tables. Turnover seems to be the most important factor. If I didn't know any better, I would say they have added seats to accommodate more customers in the same sized space.\n* The chefs are rushing. It appears as though the place has completely abandoned the 'Art' of sushi in favor of speed and efficiency. They give little regard to the presentation and balance of the dishes. Far too many times I have been handed a plate that has way too much or way too little of something, like so much vinegar on the roll that the rice crumbles at the slightest touch.\n\nBe sure that these issues were not a factor for the many years I have enjoyed Yama - that is until recently. Hopefully there is still time to fix them. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am happy for Yama's success - I just wish it was not at the expense of what made them great to begin with."
0,I took my parents while they were visiting Las Vegas.  Major diappointment.  The place was more of a gift shop than a pawn shop.  The guys on the show were apparently there but refused to come out to even say hello.  We were told that if we wanted pictures of them to buy a t-shirt.  Staff was rude and this place was a joke.  Ill never step foot in there again.  Dont waste your time.
4,Found this place by driving by - so glad we stopped. Food was delicious. We will definitely be back.
4,"I was one of the lucky attendees at the Devour event this past weekend (which was awesome) and had this awesome taco. That's how it all started. A simple fish taco that blew me away. I visited the original Joyride Taco Shop out in Gilbert several months ago when they first opened but it fell off my radar. How silly of me. \n\nSo one taco was not enough and I found myself up the street after Devour closed up shop and I definitely was not disappointed! What an incredibly beautiful restaurant! Chowed down on the Chilaquiles - enjoyed some cucumber mint aqua frescas (with vodka - so cool that they offer it with your choice of spirit), ate way too many chips, and shuffled into a cab that the staff was more than happy to call for me. The service was stellar, the food was amazing, and the ambiance after the weekend rain was incredible. (I still can't believe that I ate an entire meal after Devour - my waistline definitely does not thank me. Ahh gluttony . . . .)"
2,"Two Words = Fresh Quality.\n\nOne of the freshest high quality burgers I have ever tasted.\n\n1 star = Great menu. The menu has a variety of options. I thought it would be a simple menu, but I like the fact that they have more options than your average fast food burger joint. They even have 2 kinds of potatoes for their fries! Sweet! I had a bacon cheeseburger with avocado. Yum!\n\n2 stars = Freshness. You can really taste the difference in the meat here, and it's good!\n\n3 stars = They bring the food to you. I like that kind of service at Fast Food joints!\n\nLacks the 4th star because the SmashFries are super greasy! Sweet potato ones are not so greasy, and they are really filling!\n\nLacks the 5th star for this location because it smells really crappy outside (sewer smell) and it comes in the restaurant and ruins your whole dining experience. Yuck!"
2,"Business dinner. Nice location and atmosphere. Ordered a rib eye with no marinate, it was between ok to good. Creamed spinach and whipped potatoes were good. My knock is on service by waiter, we didn't see him much and had to flag people down for things. With all the choices on Vegas, won't be back soon."
2,This is a good place to get something different . The food quality is always good and their fat/happy items are all amazing . I was recently disappointed to find most of my favorite skinny/ healthy items are no longer on their menu . I loved the idea of treating myself to some healthier options after losing a few lbs and ended up going to another restaurant because there just wasn't anything left that I was looking forward to eating . If your looking for good food they still have plenty of options. I just hope they add back some of there salads and healthier breakfast options that are more vegetarian friendly and I might be back.
2,Good place to grab a slice of your favorite pizza for a couple bucks.  Can't go wrong with options like that!
3,"This is my #1 grocery store, one of the nicest I have ever been to, and I can walk from my apartment.  Has many of the organic specialty items as Whole Foods, but also has the cheap stuff to boot.  Be careful, though, produce and organic/natural items can be more pricey than Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.\n\n#1 rule:  bring loads of PATIENCE.  I am currently unemployed, and as such have visited this store at all hours on all days:  It is ALWAYS busy.  If you are driving, be mentally prepared not to find a spot in their parking lot or two levels of parking garage.  Aisles also seem a bit narrow, be prepared to get stuck behind slower people."
0,"The food was brought out HOT, just what you'd expect after almost a half hour waiting to be seated and an additional half hour to get our food,  which we ordered right when we sat down.... and after all that wait,  my food was overcooked (chicken and waffles). If you choose this venue,  definitely make a reservation; however, the water was great and the staff was friendly."
1,"First things first, this place is a fucking rip off, plain and simple. Almost twenty dollars with tip for a burger and a poutine to share with a friend; absolutely ridiculous. It's not even like the amount of food you get is substantial either. I could have eaten this whole meal by myself and I'm not a massive eater; just an accomplished one. \n\nThe poutine was a disappointment but alright. Not enough gravy to cover all the fries and the cheese curds were alright but not in enough abundance either. Their fries though are quite good and I do like the dips they have but I ordered a poutine, not fries and dip you bumbaclot...\n\nThe burger as well is a rip off and not fresh. They don't even try to hide the fact it's a frozen patty which to me is kind of lame...At least have some pride. It's a thoroughly decent burger though and they have good variety but to be honest I expect that if you eat here enough and try all the burgers, you'll experience the 'Subway Effect'; they all taste pretty much the same.\n\nI'm sure there is a better burger in Montreal and I know there is a better poutine. I also know you can get both of these for a better price. It's still worth it though if you want to go for fries and dip but hold onto your wallets cause this place wants to bleed it."
0,"If I could, I would absolutely give them 0 stars. \nAs for customer service they are very rude! We had booked a no - smoke room with a king bed and end up getting to their liking. (Which by the way they never informed us of any changes) We ended up getting a smoking room with 2 twin beds. I have asthma and I informed them the room smell was of extreme nuisance to me and then they replied with \""there was nothing [they] could do\"". I was not about to risk MY health and my daughters health. They became even more rude and hostile when I had no other choice but to resign the room and urge them for a reimbursement.  They wanted me entirely off the premises. They told me \""we need you to vacate the room ASAP and leave the premises\"" no apology was given for the unnecessary inconvenience. I will never come here again! And I would advise you as well to stay somewhere else."
0,"This buffet sucks. Horrible variety, no sides, only thing that was good was the roast beef. Save your money and eat somewhere else"
0,"if i could give this hotel negative stars, i certainly would.\n\nthe short story is:  twice now i have been charged $408 dollars (yes, total of $816) because of their incompetency, and they have done NOTHING to rectify the situation.\n\nlast year, i reserved two room there for ironman wisconsin.  they have a policy to cancel room two weeks prior or more.  fair enough.  two months prior, i called them to cancel both rooms. they said everything was taken care of.\n\nfast forward to two weeks prior to ironman, i double check the online system to make sure the rooms are cancelled.  they were not.  i call the hotel again to cancel  they said everything was taken care of.  \n\ntwo days later, i triple check online. still not cancelled.  i call the hotel yet again.  the woman says she'll look into it and call me back.  she never does.  a $408 charge is posted to my account. i call again.  the woman says again she will look into it \""but there's probably nothing i can do.\""  i hear nothing from her again.\n\ntwo weeks later, weekend of ironman, i get a voicemail from a different woman, confirming my room reservations.  i call her back, leave her a voicemail, clearly irritated at this point that the rooms were STILL not cancelled.  she calls me back, leaves a voicemail.  i call her back, leave her a voicemail, no return call.\n\nnow, today, a week after ironman, i get ANOTHER $408 charge posted to my account.  this is completely unacceptable!  how can you justify charging someone $816 for YOUR mistakes!?\n\nSTAY AWAY.  on top of that, it's an outdated hotel... clearly their reservation system reflects that as well."
1,"The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't rude, they just came off as if they were waiting till it was time to go home. \n\nI ordered the fish and chips and I have to say, it was the greasiest fish I've ever had. I literally had to soak up the oil off the fish with a napkin. Something I would expect from a home meal. Not from a place where somebody cooks for a living. \n\nI was also charged twice on my card for two different amounts. I was with a friend, but we had two separate bills and two separate cards. I'm sure they will take care of it but I'm not sure how that happened in the first place. Probably from the staff members who seemed to have other things going on other than taking care of their patrons."
3,"It's completely possible that we're just big dorks, but every time we go to Vegas, we stop by Television City and do a TV panel where we watch a television show and rate it, then complete a follow up survey.  For this free activity we get an envelope of coupons.  This last time, we not only got buy one get one free ice cream, but $5 off at Starbucks each.  Yea!  Free iced tea.\n\nThe staff at Television City is friendly... I think they have quotas and want to get as many people in the door as possible.  The spiel once you're in the door is the same and unfortunately they repeat the shows a lot, so you probably don't want to go more than once in a couple of days.  This last time was cool because the show we watched was Vegas and I actually really liked it and hadn't seen it yet, so, WIN!\n\nWant a free event while you'r hanging out in Vegas and like TV as much as I do?  Head on over to Television City at the MGM.  You can thank me later."
3,Recommend the beef head and tongue. The lamb taco is really two so well worth it. Very authentic and if you are looking for real authentic Mexican tacos then this is the place!
0,"MAGGOTS!!!! I wish I could leave a -5 rating on here for Chen & Wok; we have eaten takeout for here for years and always enjoyed it for our greasy Chinese fix. But last night we found fu\u00a2king MAGGOT in our broccoli. We took it back, got our money and raised a huge stink...other diners also came up to get their money back. That is by far the MOST disgusting experience I've ever had from eating out and I worked in food service for years so I've seen some pretty nasty things. NEVER EVER EAT HERE!!!! I will be calling the health department on Monday. I couldn't believe the girl said, \""Well it was probably just something from the vegetables but I'll give you your money back anyway.\"" Seriously?! It's a fu\u00a2king MAGGOT!!!! So for anyone considering enjoying good ole Chen & Wok, let me say it again....MAGGOTS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"We've lived close to this Ace Hardware for 6+ years & bc there's no Home Depot close by, we run in here for odds & ends quite often.  \nThis is a nice store, they've got a good (not great) selection & the guys who work here are usually helpful. HOWEVER, the girls at the registers are NEVER friendly & they lack the common sense to say \""thank you\"" after taking your money, This has been a consistent theme over the years.  We try to go to the True Value at 16th St & Bethany Home when we can. True Value usually has lower prices too.  \nThe clincher for me personally was when I bought several things (incl some firewood) at the front register & right after walking out a manager came up to my car asking if I had paid for the firewood. This manager walked right past the girl at the register, who I had just paid, to get to me!  She apologized, but I was really offended & annoyed that she didn't think to stop & ask the cashier if I had paid.  \nDon't expect exceptional service & you won't be disappointed."
1,"I'm pretty baffled by the reviews on here.  A friend and I went to try this bar out and made sure it was on a Steelers game night.  I will admit that it was a Monday but based on what I read here, I thought it would be packed with Steelers fans, beer flowing and boisterous fans.  Well, there were about 12 fans and 4-5 other people in casual attire.  I was pretty shocked.  Nevertheless, we decided to sit at the bar and grab a few cold ones.  So here are the pros and cons...\n\nPros: \n1) Nice, large space with plenty of TV's\n2) Pool tables for some bar fun!\n3) Friendly bartenders\n\nCons:\n1) Parking lot is small and likely overflows on weekends\n2) Very small, \""townie\"" crowd even on game nights (again, it was a Monday)\n3) Curb appeal of bar is slim to none.  It's in a strip mall.\n4) Women's bathrooms could use some TLC, although the important facilities were in working order :)\n5) Out of the way location - near the airport.\n\nI'm not saying I'd never go back to try this place on a weekend (game night) if given an incentive, but other than that, can't say I'll be back.  And, unfortunately, I must disagree with some of the current Yelp reviews.  We actually left at halftime to check out a different venue."
1,"Expensive, so red neck the meet is not god the ribs or no good coleslaw eww no espectacular i never ever i thinki not going to come back oh! Plus its flys everywhere is no let me eat  the most ugly experience i prefer drive a couple more miles and go to FAMOUS DAVES"
1,"Blech.  The menu is expansive, but many of the items are simply not very good.  It's clear that some changes have been made to accomodate the drinking crowd, which is fine, but a recent visit there is most likely our last.  The beer remains the attraction, but it's not a strong enough pull, I'm afraid."
1,ive been in here a couple times .  it's geared toward the college-aged / 20-something females that live in the south side commons and thereabouts.  nothing particularly outstanding going on .   Big Dog is a better spot for an high-level coffee/caffeine experience . delanies is as someone else mentioned very trend-aware which I can't stand .  it's better than no coffee joint in that part of Carson Street but ...
1,"I couldn't find anything worth eating, even for the inexpensive price. Dinner was only $9.99 with a Station's Card.\n\nI arrived at 7:30p.m. and most of the food had been sitting under the heat lamps for well over an hour. Dried out sub-par pizza, hot dogs reminiscent of a 24hour seven-eleven rotisserie, and a tiny tex-mex section that should never have emigrated from tex-Mexico are some of the fare options diners are subjected to. \n\nSave your money and get your fill elsewhere."
1,"I was part of a large group staying here for a weekend. Virtually every person was displeased with their room in one way or another. Our room had a solid strip of dust at the base of the wall.  The hallway on our floor looked like it had not been vacuumed in a long time. I ran into one of the housekeeping staff and expressed my displeasure in the lack of cleanliness in the hotel and her response was \""oh\"". Very disappointed since we have stayed at their location in San Diego and it is a top notch hotel so we expected similar from Vegas but we were wrong. Won't stay there again."
1,"This review is for the car wash only. I have great experiences with the gas station when I stop in once or twice a week after work. However today was my first time getting a car wash at this location. I have just driven a car I purchased home from California. It was sorely in need of some TLC from the drive and the recent monsoon weather. \""The Thumb\"" package seemed the best value as it included interior vacuum, tire pressure check, and a 7 day clean guarantee. The end result was a little disappointing as the trunk was not vacuumed, and the front and grill still had many bugs and spots all over it. I would have been happy to buy an add on if I was aware these areas were not part of the package or required special attention. My bad for not checking the trunk before I left, next time I will do a full walk around with the tech."
2,"Very good pizza, pretty basic, no bells and whistles or modern/gourmet pizza, just good, classic pizza pie. The rest of the menu is a bit limited, but if you're just looking for pizza, this place is a good bet.  The greek salad is also pretty good, heavy on the feta and black olives, which I love, and onions, which I don't, but are chunky enough to be picked off. If you are having a party for kids, you can go for the huge take out rectangle pizza, but I wouldn't order that for adults (as most pieces are inside slices, without crust)The restaurant itself isn't much in the way of atmosphere, so we've done take out, or in years past delivery.  If you want take out pizza in Mint Hill, this is a great alternative to Hawthorne's. And it's nice to support a local, small business."
4,The food and service was great. I tasted a bit of everything and nothing disappointed.
2,"I went in here looking for a few things and came out empty handed. Not because they had *nothing* I wanted, but the store is quite higgdly-piggdly inside, and the cork board I wanted was wedged between 5 others, and covered in sellotape, and the shop assistant was busy.\n\nIt does have a really big selection of paper, notebooks, art materials, crafty things though. I just wanted my cork board, meep."
1,Y'all are crazy.  I don't know how this place has so many stars.  I was not impressed.  Maybe I just had different expectations of what the food would taste like.  Korean and Mexican...I'd expect some spice.  Everything tasted sweet to me.  I don't think I'd try it again.
1,It's ok.\n\nPlayed from the tips and I got completely hammered. The landing areas are somewhat small and the course is in average condition. But then... I think I only paid 20 bucks to play there. Worth it for the money but not somewhere you go if you're on a golf trip in Arizona.
1,"Ate at this place today.  The food was mediocre at best.  I got a salmon roll, yellow tail roll and another type of roll that I can't remember the name of right now since I have dementia already stetting in.  Anyways, each roll was not cut correctly - some pieces were very big and some pieces had where the rice was not entirely covered by seaweed because of the improper cutting.   The seaweed also tasted very unfresh. \n\nIn addition, I ordered some three appetizers.   The first, appetizer was some roasted peppers.  Unfortunately, the description in the menu didn't match the taste.  The peppers were mostly tough and didn't have much taste, surprising for a pepper.  The second appetizer was a yellow tail collar.  The collar had an off taste indicating it was not fresh.  \n\nHowever, it wasn't all bad.  I got some tofu that was deep fried that was decent.  The only problem is that the tofu lost most of the crunchiness because it was swimming in some sauce."
3,"Very good, well priced and never have they messed up my order, which is rare...I'm picky and allergic to a lot! I always get the BBQ Chicken Pizza (no onions no cliantro), Tortilla Soup or Thai Salad. Those are guaranteed awesomeness. This location is great for a quick lunch while at Fashion Show Mall."
1,"Whenever I visit Canada, East Side Mario's tops my list of places to eat, as we don't have them in The States. Unfortunately, this location isn't one of the best. \n\nItalian Wedding Soup and bread are my must-have appetizers. We dined here around 7:30pm and the soup arrived tasting thicker and saltier than normal. The waitress informed us they only had bottom-of-the-pot soup left and would not be making more. We sent the soup back and had salads instead. The bread was piping hot, but took forever to arrive. When we needed a refill, the waitress disappeared for fifteen minutes before bringing more. \n\nSince the soup was a bust, we ordered the spinach dip appetizer with pita bread. This was delicious and devoured quickly. For my main, I had Spaghetti Primavera with shrimp. A beautiful array of vegetables mixed in with the pasta provided me with both dinner plus leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nWhile my main was delicious, the slow service (we were one of four tables) combined with the soup incident gave me no choice but to bump this down to two stars."
3,"Gigantic portions, great breakfast.  The hashes are served in an iron skillet, and it is more than enough food for 2 people.  I also had a kiwi-watermelon lemonade, which was served in a huge glass and was very pretty since they layered the different flavors on top of one another."
1,"While I would agree that the food was good, it's hard to get over first impressions.  After a much longer than anticipated drive from Chicago, we were eager to try out a place recommended by Chicago magazine; that - and the fact that chef is apparently a transplant from Chicago.  \n\nI called the restaurant en route to advise that we'll be 15 minutes late; \""no problem,\"" I was told.  When we arrived, hostess looked surprised that we actually showed up.  She shared a few whispering sessions with a couple of other people at the restaurant and not until I gave her a look to ask what's up that she told me that there was some \""confusion\"" with the tables and that we could either sit outside (not the best view) or wait 30 minutes for a table inside.  \n\nDesperate for some dinner since it was already getting late, we chose to take the outside table.  Needless to say, as good as the food was, it was hard to enjoy it when our table was next to a compost pail and our \""music accompaniment\"" were trucks parking on the street. For what they charge at this place, the manager could have come out, offered a dessert or something for the inconvenience or at least an apology.  Not the best way to start our Madison trip."
4,"I am really shocked at the reviews I read!  Maybe it was because they were some time ago!? I've never had a problem with this location or the Banfield inside.  They carry the food I like and when there was a voluntary recall they had no problem with my bringing all the food back to exchange for another brand.  Shauna has been our puppy trainer for 3 classes so far and will be for our last class.  She is friendly, works with all the pups equally, and will help give you tips if you need them.  My puppy walks in and is so comfortable with the staff and store she could be their official greeter!  :o)"
1,"The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the food was pretty good. \nNow the bad. \nFirst my friend and I sat at the bar to get something to eat, sat there about ten minutes, the bartender didn't even look at us. but we were there so we just opted to get a table instead. It was about 10:50 and we wanted lunch food.  WRONG. lunch there, for whatever reason, doesn't start until 11:00 on the dot. What's up with that??? and also once we got a table, it took a while to have a waitress come over to take our order. I will not be going there again."
3,"It's fashionable for students to knock the free university health center.  I don't know, walk-in visits, nurse practitioners with years of experience, a free pharmacy, free health classes, free physician care, labs, blood pressure checks, gynecological care, condoms etc., etc. sound like a good deal to me.  Maybe I'm wrong.  If the health clinic cannot handle the medical need, they refer to specialists in the community, so I can't go with the slander that they mistreat students.  Plus the facility is clean and modern, and most can walk to it."
2,"I just moved to the area and this is the second salon I have decided to try out based on reviews from yelp. I had never had a pedicure as luxurious as the one I received from Ballantyne and I was pleasantly surprised. They only have one type of pedicure available, which is $35 (a little more expensive than I'm used to), but I felt I got my money's worth. They offer a paraffin wax treatment at the end which was a nice touch. However when it came to the polish, unfortunately it looked like a toddler had painted my nails. I have never done this before, but I had to ask the owner to re-paint them. With all do respect, I think my technician was very new and she did give a great massage. \n\nI went on a Sunday at about 1pm and during my 45 min pedicure, the place became packed and very busy. The phone rang a lot during the time I was there and while they claim to take appointments (I thought I made one before going) they really just take your name and time and tell you to come without writing anything down. She must have told 4 people they can come at 2:00 that day! It seemed very unorganized and frantic when it got busy. I would go again during the week at an off time when the technicians aren't rushed and the environment is a little more relaxed."
3,"In between a 4 and 4.5\n\nThe last time I was in Vegas was several years ago when they were BUILDING the Wynn, so it I suppose it's only fitting that my first visit after a 4+ year hiatus be at the hotel that wasn't even open when I was here last.  It's almost as if they had built the hotel for me and my first visit was long overdue.  But that's just wishful thinking.\n\nThe Wynn being one of Vegas' more recent hotels, there are a few aspects of the hotel that follow an architectural pattern with some of the other newer hotels.  Take the parking garage for example.  Instead of parking garages where you go round and round as you ascend multiple levels of parking, the ramp to climb each level is on the exterior of the structure so the interior resembles more that of a supermarket parking lot.  Why I'm spending so much time talking about the parking structure I have no idea.\n\nWalking into the casino.... Oh look, slot machines!  Poker tables!  Scantily clad cocktail waitresses!  All these (and more) you will find in just about any casino, old or new, in Las Vegas.  *sigh* What a life....\n\nMy friend was able to score an upgrade up to the 52nd floor.  Yes, you heard me... FIFTY TWO.  All 3 of our rooms had great views.  The room I was in specifically had a view of the strip, and while the other 2 rooms were on the other side of the hotel, their room were overlooking a golf course.  The rooms were standard: bed, sofa and ottoman, wall-mounted flat screen TV, desk with a video phone and fax machine, and books and booklets detailing the room and resort amenities.  The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub, dual sinks with a vanity in between, a small wall TV, and a segregated toilet with a phone.  Hey, it solves the problem of answering the phone call while you're seated on the throne.  I'm just saying.\n\nI don't have to tell you that the hotel overall is just gorgeous.  The theme of the brown and gold exterior of the hotel seamlessly transports itself to the color scheme inside.  The layout of the casino and surrounding areas is not complicated to navigate and makes everything seem easily accessible.  All of the dealers I dealt with were nice, patient and courteous, except for maybe the late late hours when they're not as talkative and would probably prefer being in bed instead of handing out winnings at the craps tables.  Yes, I found my new poison of choice at the casino: craps.  I never understood the game up until this trip when a couple of my friends explained a few basics and I experienced some beginner's luck.  One session I had started with $30 and within an hour, I had quadrupled my money.\n\nWe did have a chance to experience any of the fine restaurants here at the Wynn, which include Mario Batali's Bartolotta or Daniel Boulud Brasserie.  We did however eat at their buffet for brunch for one of our meals (review to come).\n\nWould I stay here again?  Well, not unless I scored some sort of deal or promo (which my friend did) or we were in a larger group, like we were, bringing down the room cost for everybody."
0,Stay away from this store. Store credit only on returns which shows their fear of what they sell can't stand on its own.
2,Fun place to try out. I found the shrimp was a lot better than the crawfish. You just don't get enough meat from the crawfish. Overall the food wasn't really my cup of tea.
4,"Brought a friend here on a Thursday morning for her birthday treat. It was her choice and I'm sooooo glad she did! In a nutshell, Crepe Bar is a very cool place that serves delicious, well presented food with a side of awesome customer service. It's the small things that mean so much; from your decorative coffee foam, to your complimentary granola while you wait for your order, to your cute marshmallow dessert to wrap things up!\n\nMy breakfast buddy went for the tried, but true, Bananas & Nutella. Can't go wrong there! When I saw that the Grand Prix was served only at certain times (which fortuitously married with the time of our visit), I knew it was my destiny to experience the wondrous combo of savory pork belly, crisp pork jowl, sunny side egg, and sweet coffee crepe. Yes, you read right! Coffee. Who knew, right??\n\nUpon my very first bite of pork belly, my eyes rolled up into my head and I just had to close my eyes to fully enjoy the ... dare I say it... fatty goodness of the pork! There I said it! My kinda comfort food. I kept saying I should take some photos, even as i chowed down; the chance of a good picture diminishing as fast as the tasty morsels on my plate.\n\nTwo thumbs up! Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu, though not sure if I dare face the wait times on weekends as mentioned by the other reviewers."
1,"Just like reviewers before me who have the same to say...I desperately WANT to like Kiva Han. In fact, I always attempt to justify their low quality coffee, bitterly awful lattes, and subpar lunch food as \""Well, maybe this is just a one time thing?\"". It's not. It never has been. And today was the last straw.\n\nI met a friend for coffee because really what other choice do I have? Starbucks - a corporate overpriced coffee shop? Caribou - running into the same problem? Crazy mocha - if only the one in Oakland was bigger? So we settled for Kiva Han, it has a creative, funky atmosphere and we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful day. \n\nI grabbed their medium roast coffee, not because I wanted to, but because this was their only choice. They usually never have more than one roast *surprise*.\n\nTo my dismay, the coffee tasted like dirt. This comes as know surprise though, their coffee is always wretched. I've tasted better coffee in a Holiday Inn hotel room. They obviously do not put any care into choosing their beans (if they even use freshly ground).\n\nOn to their food. I have never ever eaten anything good here. I had a curry wrap once that tasty more like a mouthful of cumin and turmeric, rather than a spicy blend of well paired Indian ingredients. One friend perfectly described the food at Kiva Han \""It's like a bunch of hipsters got together and picked ingredients that sounded exotic and cool, even though they taste terrible together!\"""
1,"I was pretty dissappointed with my last visit to this location. The service was really slow and inaccurate (ordered a margerita on the rocks and frozen came). I can't really blame it fully on the waiter, the place was obviously under staffed. \nI ordered a green chilli chimmy with green sauce... and it was not good. The beef was dry and flavorous and the green sauce was bla... I couldn't finish it."
4,"I work in a office building right around the corner from them.  The place is small, but once you find it, you'll keep coming back.  Honest to God, the food is addictive.  My faves are the Italian Hoagie (reminds me of home back East) and the Chipotle Chicken sandwich.  And I also enjoy their flavored iced tea to go along with it.\n\nStaff is friendly too which makes the experience even better!\n\nI'm a fan!"
0,"Gross.  I knew it would not be the best, but I was here for a cheap table game, and I settled.  The waiters were surly and unprofessional, dropping off two of my sodas and leaving forever, arguing within earshot, not looking you in the eye.  The selection was terrible, salty, and of low quality.  The only thing I enjoyed here was the cotton candy, and guess what, TI has that too!  And somehow, it is a better quality cotton candy.  Keep walking!"
2,Went to Mc Cormick & Schmick's  on Thursday night with client the service was  good as well as the food. We had a good time.
2,"It's a good deal for the price:\nlunch - $6+\ndinner - $7-13\n\nAnd of course, for this price, you have to accept that it is not the most authentic Japanese food you will have. \n\nHowever, service is good. They provide complimentary edamame appetizer for dinner orders, where as most places charge you for that.\n\nNice interior decor for a restaurant like this. I'd say it's a place for a quick bite or light dinner."
3,"Went for lunch on a Friday in a small group during the workday.\n\nGot calamari for an appetizer round.  Breading was great, good flavor, and dip wasn't half bad especially when combined with their special hot sauce (I guess they also sell it at $5 a bottle - spicy / sweet).\n\nEach of us got a small burger (they're all available in large / small which is great), but unfortunately each of our medium ordered burgers came back well done.  I imagine such a smaller burger would be tough to cook appropriately, but I would hope that a place that specializes in burgers could figure out proper times on these things.  I had the same issue at another burger joint (not to be named in this review).  That sort of thing just blows my mind.\n\nIn the end, we'd prefer burgers cooked to order, but we're not terribly picky.  Everything else about the burgers was top notch.  Our server was very friendly, outgoing and helpful - when she overheard a comment about the burgers (seriously, we weren't ones to complain) she offered to comp the meals which we didn't want - ended up hooking us up with milkshakes (also quite good).\n\nOh, I can't believe I'm leaving this for the last item on my review - but the sweet potato tots.  Oh, the sweet potato tots!  I'll come back here often for those alone.  The texture and the taste, and the dipping sauces...  Amazing!"
3,"Stayed here twice with girlfriends already, and we like it here a lot. Clean, comfortable beds, and the clubs we go to are right downstairs. I like how the service is quick and good here. I also like that the bathrooms come with qtips, cotton wipes, etc. The views are always nice in the Wynn too. Will be back when I stay in Vegas!"
3,"This was our first visit to the Golden Corral in Las Vegas. We had went to another location in Arizona prior to our visit to this location. Here is our review.\n\nThe location/place:\nIt is pretty large inside this location. As soon as you walk up to the door, you can smell the food from outside. When we arrived during lunch, the line was out the door, and it was packed inside. When trying to get your food, it is difficult to navigate due to the high amounts of people walking around. Overall, other than the crowd, it was clean, and the seating was pretty comfortable.\n\nThe food:\nThe food is really good. Everything was fresh and tasted great. They have a salad bar, meat area, and dessert area with three fountains. They have a chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel fountain. They have strawberries, marshmallows, and other things that you can dip into the fountains. They also have ice cream and cotton candy. I like the great assortment of desserts rather just the same stuff that they have at the casinos. \n\nThe best foods that they have are the lasagna, rotisserie chicken, steak, roast beef, pizza, and the ham. Most of the food is good especially for the cheap prices.\n\n\nI give this place 4 stars because it was worth the price they charge and I don't really have any complaints. Service was good, the waiters are really nice and they make sure you are properly taken care of."
1,Nothing overwhelming here - seems pretty generic. Food was passable but I have had better. Was more chinese than thai.
3,"Great authentic Mexican food. They are known for their tamales but they weren't anything special- service is friendly, margs are tasty :) More on the touristy side and ok for families..can be a little pricey."
1,"I give this place an overall 2.5 stars:\n\nThe Pros:  Great customer service.  Large dining area that can accommodate lots of customers.  Delicious, juicy pork satay. Garlic pepper chicken was wonderful and they used all white meat!  \n\nThe Cons:  Prices are a bit inflated (expect to pay $2+ on all dishes), portions are tiny for the inflated price you pay.  Location is in a run down strip mall in a ghetto, shady part of Vegas.  \n\nMy hubby and I came to the conclusion that this place is overly hyped. We had better pad thai from The Thai Noodle House on Spring Mountain (Chinatown) for a few dollars less and double the portion size.  It was a good thing that we were not too hungry as the portions they served us were comparably smaller to what other Thai restaurants may serve you."
3,Great custard. Not as good as their location in St. George. A little rich for my taste.
1,"We live near the downtown area and decided to take advantage of the gorgeous weather on Saturday morning so we walked to Brunchies for breakfast. When we arrived my family waited outside and I walked in to put our name down on the list. There were 2 servers/hosts/employees at the stand and they were trying to figure who was next in line. They walked away and I stood there patiently while the manager walked up; no acknowledgement and called the next patron. Ok, fine - it's Saturday and busy. Then another employee came up to the stand and she looked at the list, doodled on it and didn't say 2 words to me. I stood there like a friggin' idiot but my fault, I didn't say anything but I really didn't think I had to because she is the one that is supposed to greet me! Or am I wrong? I don't know... Anyhow, she didn't acknowledge me so I left and walked across the street to Yoli's Caf\u00e9 and my family and I ate breakfast and we were happy. Sorry, Brunchies; you have horrible customer service. Biscuits and gravy can happen anywhere but damn, we wanted to experience yours but I ended up leaving with a bad taste in my mouth because no one wanted to say hi to me and put my name on the list. My feelings are a little hurt."
1,"2 Stars for being 24/7! First, I knew not to expect the best or even an average meal. This spot is good for a quick bite, to fill your belly, and in general just for a par to sub par meal. You shouldn't expect the best here. Second, the service echo'd that of a Denny's and same goes the food. I would have rated this 3 stars but to be honest its lower than average. The food will not kill you here so no worries. The diner looked fairly worn. It has seen better times but overall to be open 24/7 you can't complain, I guess."
3,Came in for lunch and was seated quickly. I ordered the beef / lamb Gyro with salad and a beverage.  \n\nMy food arrived quickly and my Gyro lamb & beef meat tasted on the dry side and the pita was overcooked to crunchy - but edible. My salad was fresh and I finished both items. \n\nOn a side note I used the restroom and it was spotless clean as is the dinning room.
0,"One star is being generous by 3 stars. My wife and I have been in here 4 times. The first time, we just had drinks so no big deal. Second time, we went to eat and after sitting at a table for 15 minutes with no acknowledgement, we left. Third time, had a good experience so we decided that the second time must have been a fluke. Nope. This was our fourth and last time there. Ordered a beer and iced tea and asked for sweetener, Had to go to the bar to ask for it again because she forgot. Then she completely forgot about us.  No menus, nothing. One went out to smoke then so did the others. Never did get a check so just left some cash on the high top and left. We will never be back. By the way- there were never more then 5-8 people in here on any of the times we went so the service had nothing to do with them being too busy."
0,"the food quality is not consistent. the wait is oh so looooonnnggg, every single time. once, i called in my order and gave them 45 minutes to prepare my food, and when i arrived at the restaurant, i waited another 20 minutes. and while i paid as soon as i got there, i was asked by staff if i had already paid before handing me my food. today will be the last time i set my foot here, because you made me wait again...oh jasmine express, you keep breaking my heart!"
4,"Okay so we're engaged, been a year, busy with work and we decide, lets go to Vegas, IN 3 weeks. Dress...check; suit...check; rings....check; great....now where to get married.\n\nDo we want Elvis and Cher as witnesses? Definitely not...\n\nWe came across the website and found a REAL wedding chapel, ya know...flowers, people who care, a coordinator (Brittany) and 2 amazing make-up artist who made my bride look prettier than I have ever seen! (Thanks Glam Squad). And from the our limo driver, Tom to Minister Al, the wedding was perfect. AND 100% STRESS FREE. \n\nWe had an incredible caring minister who really showed us he cared by giving us time and attention to personalize our ceremony (Minister Al) and then 2 beautifully talented photographers (Shanna and Pete) who gave us THE MOST AMAZING photos, spent time and an artists eye to ensure we both had shots that made us happy!!\n\nDefinitely, if you plan to have an amazing wedding, just the two of you (like we did) or whether its a whole crowd, please visit the Chapel of the Flowers! You won't regret it!"
1,"SLOW. Slow getting propane, and was surly. slow renting vehicle (took almost an hour). Tire was low and then needed replacing. On the upside they took a day off rental."
4,"I've been eating here for 20 years now. And the biggest compliment that I can them is that the food is incredibly consistent. There's never a surprise. You get what you expect every single time. Best souvlaki in the montreal area. Don't let the amateurs tell you differently. You can take your Marvins, Village Grec, and Arahova and stick em where the sun don't shine because that's where they belong."
1,"At the end of the day, its a pizza like substance."
3,Great place to spot for a drink or quick bite to eat while downtown.
0,"Tried them out at the Southpoint food truck festival a couple weeks ago after I saw very high marks here on Yelp.\n\nSucked.\n\nHow can you report to a food festival with EXTREMELY stale buns???  The old, cold, crumbly bread made everything else taste like crap.  What was worse is I waited in line for it.\n\nNot going back."
2,In town for the weekend and trying to adjust my schedule from EST. Decided to get the Vietnamese Coffee to wake me up. It woke me up but very disappointed with the portion. I finished my coffee and 3/4 of the cup full with ice.
0,I keep giving them chances and they continue to fail. All my husbands shirts are ALWAYS wrinkled and with stains on them. This shouldn't be the case because I'm paying for my clothes to be cleaned and ironed! I tried to address the issue the first time this happened and one of the girls there was really rude. I honestly don't plan on coming back ever. Really bad customer service and they don't do what a dry cleaner is suppose to do.
0,Very nice but looking at the crusty layer on the mayo and mustard I should have walked away. But here I sit on a porcelain throne regretting that meal! The owner was very nice and Im sure they will get things back on track. I also had a franchise coupon and they wouldnt honor it saying it wasnt from them. They wouldnt honor a franchise coupon? Find a store with corporate standards as your digestive tract will thank you!
4,"Look, crispy crust, we'll cooked toppings and cheese, and a Pepsi to wash it down.  This place makes real quality pizza pretty much from scratch. All toppings sliced fresh, cheese grated everyday, and sauce whipped up like butta baby!!! Order any time of the day, yea that's right, 24 HOURS A DAY!!!"
1,"The customer service here SUCKS! They've messed up orders. I've gone back in to get the things they've missed, and they look at you like what do you want me to do. In the drive thru, they don't ask what you want with your order, they just toss you your order and close the window. This used to be one of the best locations."
0,"It took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasn't even busy.  When the food finally came it was bad.  We never received an apology.  The prices are cheap, but it's not worth it."
1,"The food was great, but the service bad enough for me to say something, which I normally don't.  I work in the service industry, and customer service is everything. Coconuts doesn't understand that . I came in for dinner, there were maybe 15 patrons, and staff standing around. It took ten minutes for someone came over and take our drink order, then it took ten minutes to get the beers. Sadly, I was sitting close enough to the bar that I could see our drinks just waiting to be sent out. Then someone came and asked what would you like to drink, we explained we had already ordered and that they were sitting at the bar... then no one came back for ten more minutes.\n\nAfter an hour waiting for our food, they brought it out. It looked great, but with in that one hour timeline, no one brought napkins or silverware. As an employee walked by I asked for the silverware and napkins.... nothing happened. Then I saw a manager walking around. We flagged her down and explained  the issue, she ran and got us the silverware and came back with one napkin...we had burgers and tacos. Mind you this was after our food had been on our table for almost five minutes.  She came back with a pile of napkins, then the guy I originally came back about fifteen minutes with them.   \n\nFinally, the meal was over, the manager brought us our bill, which was all wrong. She felt pretty bad, gave us a few free rounds. Maybe they had an off day or something, but the service would make your grandparents roll over in their grave.  The food was good though, good luck trying this place out."
0,"A Waste of Good Steak!\n\nOrdered: Australian Wagyu ribeye (~$135 for 8 ounces), US Prime Wagyu ribeye (~$80 for 10 ounces), Kobe steak sashimi\n\nI was on the hunt for the best steak in Las Vegas with no price limit and picked CUT based on some research (other places we considered were craftsteak and delmonico).  \n\nThe basic beef at the restaurant is absolutely top class, but the preparation totally overpowers the natural flavors of the meat.  This a steakhouse that combines top quality meat with very mediocre cooking to produce mediocre tasting fine steak.  i.e. a total waste of fine ingredients.\n\nCUT uses the same intense 5 spice rub for all its steaks.  This marinade is delicious and does a great job on adding flavor to a nice cut of steak you'd pick up at Safeway or Whole Foods.  But when you are ordering a $135 cut of marbled and hand fed wagyu beef that or corn-fed prime Nebraska beef this is NOT the right way to prepare fine meat....we could barely taste the beef underneath the intense spices so but for the texture it might as well have been a $25 cut of sirloin from the corner store.  \n\nUnfortunately this overcooked style is common to most Wolfgang Puck restaurants.  As another example, the Kobe steak sashimi was prepared with a lovely soy vinagrette but then doused with so much of the sauce and with added salt so that  it was basically impossible to actually taste the steak underneath the small pond of sauce in the plate.\n\nAfter having dined at many fine steakhouses around the world we were looking forward to a great meal with some great local and imported cuts of steak, but instead paid almost $200 a person for a mouthful of spices smothering some otherwise  fine meat.  What a shame!\n\nOn a positive note, the service was very good and the decor and ambience of the restaurant are top notch."
4,"I met one of my best friends here... she was a server and she would just up and chat like we'd been friends forever, that is how the staff is.  I became a regular for lunch since I worked right down the street.. Phenomenal food, great atmosphere.. don't work down there street anymore and don't get there as often as I'd like.. Pizza Cookie.. one word: AMAZING!!!"
1,"Good stuff in here but expensive. Go up State Street and find t shirts, hats, etc on sale."
2,"I hear a lot of people bragging about growing up in \""insert your northeastern city here\"" and how great the pizza is there.  Pizza should be like this.  Pizza should not be like that.  Blah, blah, blah.\n\nThe way I see it, I had it good growing up in the middle of nowhere.  I grew up eating chain store pizzas and loved it!  And now that I'm all grown up I not only appreciate great pizza (hard to find), but I also enjoy good cheap macro produced pizza.  It all has its place.  And when I want a fast, cheap pizza Domino's does the trick.\n\nI prefer the pepperoni and salami (recommended by my fiance who will never admit to it), but also really like the double bacon.  Two mediums two toppings for twelve bucks.  Home alone for the weekend?  Boom.  \n\nFive star it ain't.  But if you aren't snobbish about pizza and what you think it ought to be, Domino's is a tasty way to spend a meal."
3,"Fat G. coming from Ayrsley. Having got off the plane in Charlotte and looking for a place to eat in town, we came across a place that looked nice and different and was actually open Sunday night.\n\nHarry's is a combination bar/restaurant in the town of Ayrsley. Surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. When you go in, there is someone to greet you. Directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. On the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.\n\nThey have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. I ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that I can't remember right now. The burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.\n\nWhat surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, I would consider it a positive aspect to mention.\n\nI wish I were able to review other food spots in the area, but even considering this was our only place that we went to eat out, it was a good choice. The place is good for watching the game, or hanging out with people."
2,"Bummer that Lisa had such a bad time here. My experience was much better.\n\nA friend of mine comes here most Saturday nights for their karaoke set up and since I've never done karaoke (I still haven't!), I thought it might be fun to come down and watch my friend and the others. It was fun and the waitress did a fine job of keeping our drinks filled.\n\nCarolina Bistro is a one-off not-chain family-run restaurant. The menu is focused on Italian-style entrees. Decent variety of beers - a dozen bottled and a dozen draft - which is unusual."
4,"So I don't normally give out five stars, but really, what the hell do you have to compare Cowfish to?  Nothing.  There is nothing out there in the Southeast that I know of that is coming even close to this place.  Being from Atlanta where the burger craze is in full swing, this place puts some of our burger spots to shame.  Did I mention the sushi is bad-ass?\n\nI mean, even if you know of a place in Charlotte to get better sushi, or burgers, or milkshakes, or Burgushi (doesn't exist anywhere else, seriously), or tea, or cocktails, or good wine, you can't get them all under one roof like this place does!\n\nWas only in Charlotte for a couple of days, and I had to come twice just because I would have felt bad if I came here any less..  The menu is huge!  It would take you at least a couple of years dining  casually at this place to even try half of the menu.\n\nBurgers I had were great and cooked perfectly.  Sushi rolls, although expensive, were awesome.  Burgushi, was strange but good and I would try it again.  Milkshake was tasty.  Didn't have a chance to try the \""adult\"" milkshakes that contained booze, but I'll have one next time.  Seaweed salad was one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThese guys are booked pretty solid for dinner, best bet is the bar if you can't get a table.  Less crowded for lunch, but not by much.  \n\nIn a great part of town that had a great little community.  Man, I didn't realize that Charlotte was such a foodie town, I'll be back for sure."
0,"Now that I had first hand experience with some of the management I will not be going back. And in case anybody wonders I went to the management, they didn't come to me."
3,For attached to a mall it is good food and classy decor.  Reasonable rates.
4,Good food and good service. We waited a half hour for just two of us but worth the wait. We loved it!
4,"Went here on a date and had a great time. The atmosphere and decor was very classy. When I entered the restaurant I was greeted immediately and sat down at a booth.  I received a wine list on an ipad and I thought that was pretty neat.\n\nVincent was our server he was very knowledgeable on the different cuts of meat an told us all the great deals that were going on. We chose to get an appetizer which was the BBQ shrimp which was amazing!! The sauce just melted in your mouth!! I got the taste of season entree and my date got a steak that he loved with a side of potatoes.\n\nWe had four different people stop by our table to make sure everything was ok.\nWe overall had an amazing time and the food was great. The prices are up there but worth it. We want to check out the happy hour, it looked like a bunch of good deals."
3,Excellent variety of trails. Easy/moderate climbs to three summits and the circumferential trails are in such good shape I was able to run them.\nI parked on the street near Coral Gables and 7th Street. Four stars since there are no facilities. Great area though!
1,"Visited in April with my family and boyfriend.  Again, the atmosphere and service were nice, but my spanakeftedes were so dry they were basically inedible, even with the accompanying tzatziki sauce, and the cacik on the side was not impressive either.  I still do really like the atmosphere and I WANT to like the food but the fact that my dishes have been too dry on both visits means that I don't know how many more chances I'm willing to give."
4,Wow!!! I may never be able to eat regular food again.  Have the toffee pudding for dessert!!!!   It was to die for. The only thing that could have made it better would be if Ramsey was there!
4,"I have been a client of Mill Avenue Travel and Sue for nearly twenty years. The level of service, creativity and ability to find the best deals has kept me coming back.  I have used Mill Avenue for business travel as well as personal and the professionalism, personal touch and reliability has paid off so many times.  Recently my husband and I decided to start checking off our \""must see\"" vacations.  We have always been independent travelers, making our own plans and going by the seat of our pants.  Definitely not \""tour group\"" material.  Sue suggested to us that we consider personalized tours when we went to Machu Picchu and Eygpt -- that meant we had all the benefits of being on a tour, but the tour group was comprised of only the two of us, a drive and a guide. It was amazing on both accounts and less expensive than booking with a tour company and being hauled onto a bus with 20 or 40 others.  Sue and Leah understand our needs, preferences and desires, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel each time.\n\nMy most recent inquiry was on behalf of a bereaved family member who needed to get home on short notice for Christmas this year.  I had shopped the Internet, as you do, to get a feeling for the cost.  I called Mill Avenue and they were able to find a better fare at a more reasonable time.  It was amazing and greatly appreciated.\n\nUsing a travel agent actually can save you money more often than not in these Internet driven times.  If you have travel needs, give Mill Avenue a try. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Okay first things first, the server was super rude. Made us seem like we were straight douchebags for picking this place to eat lunch. We are in the industry, we are not demanding and we tip really good. The food was 70% on point. We were literally the only ones in here and it took near forever to get our food. Overall I give this place a C+."
1,"I was terribly disappointed.  This place has nothing on Smeeks.  We weren't even acknowledged as we walked in the store despite it being mostly empty in there.  That was rude.  The candy selection pretty much sucks and none of it was anything I hadn't seen before.  Prices were fine I suppose, but this place just left me underwhelmed.  I don't do vinyl, so I can't say anything about that, and there were some shirts there too, but again, I came in for candy so I left empty handed.  Sadly, this place just reinforces my belief that Grand Avenue is full of businesses that just don't care."
4,"We visited this restaurant off the cuff, we happened to see it as we were driving by.  We were seated outside on the lovely patio.  Our server, Jesse, was gregarious and cordial and helped set the experience off to a wonderful start, explaining the tapas, dishes, and deserts with enthusiasm and excellent knowledge.  \n\nWe started with 3 of the appetizers that were vegetarian (she is vegetarian, I am not), and a cheese plate.  For our main course she had the tomato soup and I had the skirt steak.  The tapas were excellent, no two ways about it.  The cheese plate was good, the pear jam a nice touch and balancing everything well.  \n\nShe wasn't a big fan of the soup as it was very rich, dark, maybe a little towards paste.  I had the skirt steak which was ridiculously good.  The fries were also great.\n\nDessert... I had a cup of coffee (great) and the peanut butter/chocolate special.  She had the apple crisp/sandwhich thing which was highly recommended by Jesse.  I have to give the nod to the apple desert, it was near perfect.  The peanut butter/chocolate concoction was also good, although a bit rich for me, and slighly spoiled by me tasting how damn good the apple desert was.\n\nThe service was great.  Jesse made the night.  He was entertaining, helpful, and we had a nice (brief) conversation prior to leaving.  Good service helps.  Reading some of the reviews it appears that others haven't had the same experience; I guess maybe it was luck of the draw for us, but we'll definitely come back."
0,This place sucks. Bagel with butter or cream cheese means you have to put in on yourself. So the pricey fee for a bagel must be for all their manual labor. Not. I waited 15 minutes for a plain bagel. Unacceptable.
4,"Loved the foie gras yakitori (since CA banned it, this is heaven!), age tofu was out of this world and they made the tofu in house fresh, topped with ikura and seaweed and the broth was just nice, not too salty or sweet. Very delicate! Poached egg with sea urchin and ikura was very tasty and super duper fresh! Chicken teba wing was juicy and crispy on the outside, nice. Kurobuta pork cheek was the best, tender and not too salty, and crispy. Oden was just ok, I had better one. The butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce was devine (a bit small for $7). We came at 11:30 midnight because they were super small and busy. A lot of items were sold out, so bummed. We wanted to try the juicy fried chicken, steamed foie gras egg custard, kobe beef tongue, oyakodon, green soba, the little hot pot on small fire stove, and crispy fried shrimp. Oh, they had 2 bathrooms, the prettiest I have ever seen! The sea ocean theme with aquarium and nice ocean ceiling, lighting and wall, and nice bedat seat. The other bathroom was a jungle theme with rose petals, big tree trunk and leaves flowers ceiling, with bird chipping music, so soothing! A definite must try in Vegas!!!!"
2,"First Indian Place I have been to in las vegas and i was excited. I had read the reviews on yelp and was anxious to try the place out.\n\nYou walk in and immediately you are succumb to a dark, woody, quiet environment. It is calm, soothing and relaxing. The booths were nice and big and very comfy.\n\nI deducted a star because as an American, I should always have the option to American drinks. No tea, no lemonade, no soda. Water or Lassi seemed to be our only option and I was disappointed in that.\n\nThe food was good, not great. I have had definately had better Indian Food. I was extremely happy that they had Butter Chicken but in my opinion it should have been a little more creamier. \n\nThe tandori chicken didn't seem authentic either. So that was big a NO for me.\n\nThe naan, wasn't the freshest or softest I have had either. \n\nMaybe it was the day we went but I felt they should have had more variety for chutneys.\n\nThe buffet itself was a bit pricey for the amount of different choices they offered. \n\nI did like most of what I had. Very filling. Ate one and half plates.\n\nNo indian people eating there either. That should have been my number one sign.\n\nI would go back - maybe."
4,"Perfect pizza!  We practically had the place to ourselves so our service was attentive and efficient.\n\nIf you like the chain places that make their pizzas in a kicked-up Easy Bake Oven with a conveyor belt, this place may not be for you.\n\nThe pizza and house salad were made with high-quality, fresh ingredients and I thought reasonably priced.  Pizzas are priced similary, if not less than the chain places, and is a million-percent better.\n\nThe small salad ($5) was a good size for 2 and included crisp romaine, mushrooms, red onions, terrific roasted red peppers and we added fresh mozarella for an additional $2.  The mozarella was so tasty!\n\nWe ordered the 16 inch cheese pizza which was $13.  It was the best pizza I have every had, and I have eaten alot of pizza!  Thin crust was crunchy, but still a little chewy, the crushed tomatoes they used for sauce had a very nice tomato flavor, and we had 2 bubbles, which I've found you can only get at places that are cooking their pizza at high temperatures.\n\nThe menu said they are opening a new location soon in Gilbert.\n\nI'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area.  If I could have, I would have eaten there twice while I was there!"
0,"Pretty disappointed. Didn't get the room that we booked (king size), instead we got a 2 queen that's a shared room since they have our room away! (a door in between). And the neighbors were loud! \n\nNot to mention that we're on our honeymoon for the weekend. \n\nFront desk is aware and comp us with $100 credit worth of anything in the hotel (buffet, etc) upon check in. They said if we booked with a diff company (Expedia) which is incorrect 3rd party btw; there is a guarantee in a spot but not the specific room. Wth?!\n\nEven with the comp credit - disappointed with the experience thus far. If it's any other day - fine. But it's our honeymoon.\n\nIf anything upgrade us, not downgrade us. \nShould have gone with other hotels."
0,"I loved Dr Turner herself, but ended up changing doctors about 3 months into my pregnancy because i couldnt handle their office staff anymore. It was problem after problem with them and they are EXTREMELY unfriendly. When i called to complain to the office manager, instead of them taking care of the problem, i received a letter from this practice that they could no longer see me. I was very upset because instead of taking into consideration the problem at hand, they booted me. I was treated fairly and i just think this is bad practice. Dont ever tell them you have a problem and you should be ok."
2,Went there for a wedding. The food was mediocre (Canneloni) and the service was below average... I would never go back there because the quality of the food was average and I don't eat at average tasting restuarants if I can help it.
4,"There is a huge menu. Lots of omelets, crepes (crepes are made witha very thin layer of egg), waffles, sandwiches, and more. I started my meal with a banana muffin. It was large enough to be a meal by itself. Moist and very delicious. They accommodate changes in the menu items including half orders, egg whites only, etc. Service is  consistently friendly. Highly recommended."
2,"Clean, friendly family place that sounded like a great idea but was not what I expected. The waitress was obviously new but that didn't bother us that much except she got our drinks wrong. I think it might of been what we ordered but when we opened the lid it was cold, and had way too much flavoring. However, the part that didn't suck was that we got $11 off our appetizers from an email coupon. We're not really planning to go back based on our visit."
1,It was ok. Too much of a chain feel to it for it to be considered authentic Greek food. Try Pita Jungle instead.
3,The food was really good along with the service but the prices were much too High. I loved how the place gives you such a comfortable feeling though. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS.
0,WORST PIZZA EVER. really bad food. terrible service.
2,"It's alright, nothing special.\n\nTotal hole in the wall in a sketchy part of Central... obviously there won't be ambience.  Food was fine -- injera was spongey and not too sour; wots were flavorful; coffee was nice and strong.  Service was what you would expect at an ethnic hole in the wall.  \n\nWe opted to get a hookah after dinner... this entailed walking through a sliding glass door to an attached \""bar.\""  It was really tacky and hilarious and once it got late enough, people were actually coming to hang out there.  Unfortunately, one of the bar patrons kept taking phone pictures/videos of me/in my direction... so I left.\n\nOh yah, don't get the homemade honey wine.  Unless you're a bear and like things to taste like straight honey.  Then, get the honey wine."
3,The food was well worth the wait. We ordered a variety of things and were not disappointed!
3,I'm really glad I found this place. Not many decent Boba spots in North Vegas. This one always delivers. Great variety of boba & tea. Even the food is good and portioned just right for a quick snack. Such friendly service. They always seem so patient with me while I'm taking forever to figure out what I want to order. My only gripe: it's always a bit too warm for me inside. I wish they'd turn up the air conditioning just a tad more.
0,"I ordered the Sammy's L.A. Style Pastrami and the garlic Romano fries. Both was too salty. The pastrami sandwich was too plain. The fries was too oily and salty. The wait was long because there was only two guys working. One was the cook and the other took the orders. I expected so much more since it had 4 stars. The only good thing that I got out of it was that they were nice and I received a small free strawberry lemonade. Sorry, but I'm not going there again."
1,"This place couldn't make it at McCormick Ranch and I predict that they won't make it through the summer at their Arrowhead location.  My wife and I went in on a Saturday night but were tentative to do so since neither the name of the restaurant nor any of the signage provide any clue to the type of cuisine they offer.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant I was I immediately optimistic because the decor and layout were very appealing.  However, my period of optimism was short lived when a waitress told us we had to go to the counter to order.  Was I in a nice restaurant or Carls Jr.?\n\nMy wife ordered a fried seafood basket which she seemed to enjoy and I had an oyster po boy that was very good.  The oysters were not overcooked, which is usually the case, and the heirloom tomatoes as topping are a great idea.  \n\nI wish them the best of luck because I really enjoyed my meal but unfortunately a place in the Arrowhead area that only has 10 customers on a Saturday night isn't going to be able to keep the lights on for long.  I would recommend the owner really consider changing from counter service to table service so the full bar they tucked away in the back can begin generating some revenue and hang some more descriptive signage so people walking or driving by have an idea of what awaits them inside."
0,"You never get a second chance to make a good first impression. My wife and I walked into the lobby and the VIP desk (which we paid for so we wouldn't have to wait in the long line trying to check in) was closed. We then waited 20 minutes in line to check in. Then when we finally got to the counter, got our room keys we took our bags upstairs as their was no porter to carry the bags, then when we got to our room, there was someone else in it! LOL! So we had to take our bags back downstairs and stand in line again to get another room! On the second trip up the elevators we were assigned room 1625 in The Gold Tower which was right near the elevators. Which we heard every night, all night, for all 4 days of our stay. Out of the 4 days we stayed, our room was only cleaned twice, one of the sinks in the bathroom was clogged and they finally got maintenance to come unclog it the second day. One of the lamps in the room didn't work, and the way the bathroom was designed, you had to close the bathroom door to open the closet. Why they had the closet in the bathroom I still couldn't figure out. Then when you opened the closet doors they wouldn't stay open. Then when we checked out which was early in the morning on a Monday the VIP desk was also closed so we spent money upgrading to VIP for nothing. This lack of service also cost them thousands of dollars in gambling revenue which they lost because after dealing with some of the staff at the hotel and the casino, I refused to do any gambling at The Nugget and caught a cab to the strip. This hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel and has a very nice pool area and casino. The Fremont Street light show is also nice. However this hotel is not a four star hotel based on the customer service which was seriously lacking and the overall design of the rooms. The rooms are very cheap compared to staying on the strip, however you are going to sacrifice service. If you are someone like me who doesn't worry about price, then spend the extra money and stay on the strip. In all my trips to Vegas I have always stayed on the strip, so this time I wanted to try staying downtown since people had told me about the great renovations at The Golden Nugget. Although they spent a lot of money on the pool area and the casino, they would have gotten more bang for the buck firing the staff and hiring all new people!"
3,"It was fun to leave reality and experience zumanity! If you blush easily and hate foul language, this might not be the show for you. I really enjoyed it! It was super sexy and creative. It was fun to go to a show and feel like anything goes. My best friend and I got tickets at one of the half price outlets for $68 each and had first row balcony seats. The only reason I would like to get any closer was to increase the chances of my easily embarrassed friend being pulled up on stage and being placed on \""the lazy susan of sex.\"" The music was awesome, and the costumes (well, what costumes there were) were fun too. This is definitely \""different.\"" If you're curious and think you might enjoy it, then GO! You'll be pleasantly surprised!"
1,This hotel was ok. It was good value for being in Vegas especially located in the middle of the strip.  The room was not too good.  The beds didn't even come with comforters and at the end of the bed was a rug like thing that was pink.  The bathroom was alright the shower had a little rust in it and there was a soap under the sink and the maids never picked it up while I was there which was disgusting.  The casino part of the hotel was pretty good when you have a low budget where table games start at 5 dollars and blackjack is 10.  You will get some good benefits if you have a platinum total rewards card or higher which can jump the buffet line or get discounts off of the hotel store. Overall this hotel is below average. I probably won't be staying here next time.
4,"When you have impeccable service and phenomenal food, you will always have my attention and adoration. THIS place is my fave spot for every excuse possible to frequent it. It hits the mark every time. I love sitting at the bar or patio area because Hillstone just attracts quite the crowd of movers and shakers because what's the fun in a staring contest. \n\nDefinitely start with the house-smoked salmon. That in itself could be your entire meal with a couple of glasses of wine, but then I would be short changing you a review of their offerings wouldn't I? On a side note, always order the grilled artichokes if they are available. It will seriously ooze goodness all over your mouth. The last thing I think about is salad at a steakhouse, but I will say that the Blue Cheese Wedge Salad,  Chicken Kale Salad or the Yellowtail Sashimi Salad are my fave side dishes to accompany the Hawaiian Rib Eye, or the Prime Rib. \n\nHere's the crazy thing. They have sushi and I haven't even tried that because I am so smitten by the other choices. Says a lot for me to give 5 stars without trying everything.  I actually will have to venture back strictly for that feasting. While their sister restaurant Houston is a fave, Hillstone takes the spotlight. It sits in a class of its own, maybe because every outing has always left me with a dazzling smile. Parking can be nuts but I promise it's worth the walk and you'll appreciate the stroll after gorging on their culinary delights."
3,"Had some delightful nibbles in here , plenty to buy however EXTREMELY overcrowded due to the high spec and quality in the shop but none of these people seem to want to buy stuff"
1,"I'm not impressed. I came across this restaurant when looking for a location to hold a team breakfast for my department, and this was close to the office. Because we were celebrating I bought a party pack of Eggees to share with the team, and I requested that the restaurant put the sealed container in their walk in to keep it frozen. I was immediately denied, and cited health code. I was confused, and asked if they would hold an \""outside\"" cake in their walk in for a birthday party, and the manager told me \""That was different.\"" The ignorance and indeed the unwillingness to be helpful will scratch this place off my list from now on."
1,"Two small rooms that hold the poker tables. Often filled towards midday and past with little mini-tournaments, the atmosphere here is fun, albeit it can be filled with locals at times, and so going into one of those games can leave you a bit high and dry.\n\nThey do have high hand bonuses, which is nice."
4,"Angel is absloutely Fabulous!! Our Office Shines!!! \""Scent from Heaven\""- Literally! We are so happy our office found her! Thank you so Much for all the work you Do!!! We will be and have been recommending \""Scent from Heaven\"" to our patients, and Business partners! \n\n;-) Dental Works P.C.\nScottsdale, AZ"
3,"Too crowded down the street and late for a Gammage production, we stopped in for a bite and were SO pleasantly surprised. The service is attentive and friendly and the place is super clean. Pizzas here are both unusual and mainstream. You can go either way and be happy as can be. The crust on that barbecue chicken pizza was undeniably tasty. Sauce that's not too sweet or salty and cooked perfectly. I can't imagine trying anywhere else when I have a pizza craving. Need to work on that spinach salad though - all spinach and the extras were hard to find. I'll be back though, and I can't wait."
2,"This is a good place to get a well priced coffee, tea or hot chocolate, but I wouldn't come here for anything more than that as the prices can be a bit steep when it comes to food. \nFor a cappuccino, it only costs \u00a31.75, which is very reasonable and tastes nice and frothy. But when I looked at the food menu, I thought that I would wait and go somewhere cheaper for my lunch. The cheapest sandwich that they do is \u00a34, and although it has a lot of fresh ingredients in it, i would much prefer if they would do some basic sandwiches and charge these more modestly. They do a range of other food such as baked potatoes, soups and all day breakfasts.\nThe shop itself is pretty small, but there is a couple of tables outside, which could be put to good use on a nice Summers day."
0,"Never again....\n\nApparently, in Treasure Island, they charge double the tax of Nevada because of unknown reasons. The manager explained that it was just the policy of the casino. The food is overpriced and it was not worth the money paid. My wife ordered the grilled chicken, hoping that it would be healthy and delicious. Instead we got a piece of chicken that is not seasoned. Anyone with a frying pan would be able to cook that same meal. We were expecting more. It also came with a  side of horrendous cole slaw. My wife loves cole slaw and she took only one bite of it. BUT on the upside, the fries were good. \nErnest our was waiter was polite and attentive."
1,"They say 3rd time is the charm, but unfortunately not for Pink Taco. Everytime I've come here the service is slow. I've been seated at tables inside & outside, as well as the bar. The service was the same everywhere. However last night took the cake! Came in about 830pm & sat at the bar. Immediately greeted by one of the bartenders. That was the last interaction w/ that bartender. Mind you we were 2 of 5 people on his side of the bar. We had to ask the bartender on the other side for another round. The guy next to us got up to pay at the front because the original bartender never bothered to check back in w/ him for payment. A request of lemon wedges were made on every round of drink, however on the 3rd round the 2nd bartender said 'sure I'll be right back' & never brought any. Instead the bartender brought a lemonade, but didn't give it to us it stood on the wet bar in front of us. When I asked what it was, the bartender replied 'I thought you ordered this'. I placed my card in the glass so I could pay. It stood in the glass for about 15 minutes. The original bartender never even bothered to look over. He was too busy cleaning up to handle the last 2 customers on his side. I had to get up & take the check to the front to pay. HORRIBLE SERVICE! \nThe only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because they do have a good happy hour 4-7pm. The food however is nothing special. I'd recommend going someplace else. If you do eat here expect slow service, ok food, & to probably have to talk to a manager about it all."
0,"40% of games were out of order...on their first Saturday?  Trying to redeem card points is awkward at best. You walk into their retail room and hopefully someone will ask you if you want to see what you can get!  We had to ask to find out how many points we had.  Redemption is fair, at best. Games aren't great, most don't work.  Restaurant is large and expensive.  Pretty disappointing in comparison to the Gameworks we had on The Strip."
2,"I like the chopped salad and club sandwich.\n\nNot necessarily \""healthy\"" but wholesome.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is nice in the fall or a spring day.\n\nI throw this in to the mix for lunch once and a while, but only on days that I have more than 60 minutes available."
4,"WOOOOOOW \n\nUMMMMMMM... did I already say WOOOOOW??\n\nWe waited about 25-30 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon/evening/ My group ordered Jalapeno Poppers, and I ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger for myself. \n\nThe Jalapeno Poppers- I can't really say it was good or bad although the sauce was really delicious. Out of the 6 poppers, I got the \""special\"" one, which turned out to be EXTREMELY SPICY!!! OH CRAP. I never got to taste a regular one so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like.. \n\nHell's Kitchen Burger-  my mouth was still burning from the special popper, and I don't normally eat spicy food, but I really wanted to try Hell's Kitchen burger, which is supposed to be somewhat spicy. so I asked our attentive and energetic waiter to put less jalapenos in my burger. The burger still tasted amazing even with less jalapenos. I was a little worried if it was going to be bland, but it wasn't! Oh, how I wished I could finish the burger...I only ate half of it and forgot about the other half and left it in my suite for 2 days! I had to throw it away of course.... I wanted to cry. :'( \n\nI must come back here..."
0,"We were going to try this place twice, but each time when\nI presented a local coupon they refused to accept it.\nI don't trust businesses like this who play games to try to\nget you into the restaurant ... kinda like bait & switch."
2,"Vegas was amazingggggg!!! The Stratosphere itself was just ok. Hardly spent any time there so nothing great to say or not to say. Had to call twice for towels which was a pain. Room service was stupid expensive. The room itself wasn't terrible, but the bathroom was crazy small which really sucked. Overall, its cheap, its close to the Wynn and Encore and we all slept just fine, at least the very few hours we actually got any sleep! Party like a ROCKSTAR BABY!"
3,"The Buster Brownie, a brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top, was out of this world. The atmosphere is fun and inviting fusing pink into nearly every aspect of the place. A great place to bring a date."
4,"Definitely an awesome hotel.  I love stealing stuff from hotels. Once I stole two terrycloth bath robes from a room at the Venetian. What's worse is that I was with my mom. She stole one too. Then we started to get paranoid that maybe they would notice they were gone from the room.  So we went out to the housekeeper's cart and took three robes off the cart and put them in the room.  Then we started to get paranoid that they had hidden cameras in the hallway and were going to add the price of the robes to our room bill.  So we figured out a way to smuggle the stolen ones out without being seen.  You'll get a lot more value for your money if you can manage to swipe two or three robes and enough towels to make a complete bath set. The gold accent bands on the towels complement my bathroom very nicely.  oh, I liked how the room had a terraced layout, stepping down to the lounge."
0,"Highly disappointed. This was my 2nd trip here because I had such a great first experience. They changed the menu so I wasn't sure what to order but went with the california chicken sandwich. Yuck. The sandwich was VERY dry. And I'm not even a picky eater. My husband ordered a mushroom burger and was picking off mushrooms just to get to his burger. We ordered tortilla chips and never saw them until we were ready to leave. Our bartender left for about 20 minutes and we had to ask for service. All in all, the food was bland and the service was really bad. Won't go back, except for maybe the retail store. They had cool stuff."
1,"Three Words:  Overpriced Chinese Food\n\nFor a chain, it's not that bad chinese food - not authentic, definitely what you call \""Americanized Chinese Food\"", I'm always confused why they come to your table with their \""special sauces\"" and then mix it, it's just soy sauce, hot sauce and mustard, am I not correct?  The portions are smaller than a usual Chinese joint and did I say over-priced?  I guess if you're in Madison this could be the place to go for Chinese, but then  you have to pay more for not even really good Chinese.  I've been here more than once with my family, we always seem to gravitate towards here if we want Chinese and we want to sit-down and eat.  The service here isn't the best either, they seem to just pride themselves in there fancy, over-the top atmosphere of \""Chinese\"" decorations and huge horse statues mounted outside the front doors."
1,"It's been awhile since we been here. Very very disappointed ... Service bad, asked for salt and pepper and they brought it to another table! We asked for fries with the entrees and they came before ! But not only that the \""pommels frittes\""  were terrible, reheated fries! I would have expected the best ones around! I will have to drive to Zinc for that! The quiche another \""specialty\"" wasn't cooked enough and it also looked microwaved! Oh I forgot the pumpkin soup, something that use to be so great that we use to reorder! - had no taste! We passed on deserts this time as we were afraid of yet another disappointment... I hope the owner would focus on the old places not only on the new city one!"
4,"I love that this place has a Saturday happy hour! We came for drinks and an appetizer before going out and it was great! The decor is super fun to watch. They had a move playing in the background as well. Lots of servers were around to help others too! The drinks were yummo and the food was great, we had sweet potato fries. I will totally be back!"
0,"We had friends in town from out of state and wanted to take them to Corleone's since it was one of our favorite casual restaurants. We were there on July 12, 2010 around 1:30pm or 2:00pm. When we walked in the door, we were given the spiel about how much better Corleone's is than other cheesesteak places. He (the manager) even went as far as to put down the other Corleone's restaurant on 16th street and Camelback in Phoenix that we frequent quite often, like at least weekly sometimes a couple times a week.\n\nKeith (or so he said that was his name), the manager, proceeded to  make cocaine and drug references about the food. Saying that his creation flies out the door like cocaine, good drugs and gold bars. After we stated that we didn't appreciate the drug and cocaine references because we had a 14 year old girl with us, he proceeded to make an inappropriate remark about her looking more \""mature\"" than a 14 year old girl. One of us left with the 14 year old and her mother. When asked who the manager was, he told us that he was and tried to shake hands. After refusing to shake his hand and starting to walk out the door, he said and don't ever grace my door again...no problem, we would NEVER go back. It's sad that a person like this can ruin a very good restaurant for more than one location but I am seriously considering never going to another Corleone's since someone like that can be a manager."
0,"I previously loved Vdara and recommended them to all of my friends, however my last stay changed this.  An hour after checking out of the hotel I realized I had left my brand new sonicare toothbrush in the hotel.  I immediately called the hotel and they told me to call back tomorrow after they had finished cleaning the room.  I did and they said they did not find anything but that I should call back later in the week to see if it was found.  I called back again and, again, nothing.  I understand I am responsible for my belongings, however this makes me question the trustworthiness of the staff that cleans the room.  I still don't understand why someone would want to take a toothbrush or, maybe throw away something that is obviously not trash or a disposable toothbrush. I contacted Vdara and informed them of the value of the toothbrush ($200) and they had me file a report since it was over a certain amount.  They also said they would contact me within the next few days once they reviewed the claim.  A month later, I received a letter in the mail saying they very sorry about the situation but under Nevada law they are not liable.  They also went on to state that, by law, they provide a safety deposit box at no cost (per the law) to store valuables in.  Who would ever store an electric toothbrush in a safe?!  This is horrible customer service.  I have had friends who have accidentally left valuables (including an engagement ring!) and non-valuables (articles of clothing) in hotel rooms and have had them returned. I would never have written this yelp review if this incident had been handled in a satisfactory manner but it is obvious that Vdara is not concerned with customer satisfaction, only what they are liable for by Nevada law.  In addition to possibly employing untrustworthy staff, customer service and guest satisfaction is severely lacking."
2,I have been going since January of this year and today there was a price increase of $5. I need to watch what I spend so this took me by surprise as I pay in cash. As far as the work they do a great job and I will be sorry to leave them but they did not take into account loyalty or cash.
4,Really cute place!  We have a family and they have a large selection of Hats for the girls to wear while they are having tea. Needless to say the kids love it. \n\nThere is a large selection of tea's to choose from and the food is good. There are also great deserts that are made fresh in house. \n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing place to unwind this is a good one.
1,"Eh, good place to use comp dollars, but don't go out of your way to eat there. It's seems like what someone who never tasted real BBQ would make it they were trying to make BBQ. Decor felt forced, glad I had a Groupon. Wish we had kids with us, as there was a very talented balloon artist, the balloons were probably better than the food."
1,"the food is fine. my cantonese friends claim it's quite authentic actually, but the service sucks. hostesses and waitresses both quite rude and i'd rather take my money elsewhere."
0,"Osaka in Summerlin lost a long time repeat customer. I am really sorry we didn't read the other reviews before going back last night. This restaurant needs some serious help! \n\nHonestly, I feel like the place has turned into a roller skating rink dance party with sushi on the side. The service is beyond horrible. After being seated, we sat there for at least 10 minutes without anyone even coming over to ask us for our drink orders. I finally sent my husband to find the manager; we were told that no one communicated to the wait staff that we had been seated (even though every waiter AND the manager looked directly at us several times) oh and did I mention there was only one other party at one of the Teppanyaki tables in the restaurant and a couple sitting at the bar. The food was just okay, with the exception of the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (don't try it, it's gross and way overpriced). As for the amenities, the restroom is just hideous...it looks like all the money was tapped out on the unnecessary disco lights, trying too hard out of place decor, and the wannabe club scene at a joke of a bar with way too loud music. To the owners of Osaka in Summerlin, I'm really sorry guys but it's just the harsh truth and you are failing to be awesome - hopefully you can turn it around."
4,Great customer service and so affordable! Will keep coming back here for all my jewelry repairs!
4,"This has to be hands down my favorite place to eat!!  It's always crowded and you have to wait in long lines but it's worth it. My first time ever trying lengua and I was a bit freaked out at first but it ended up being DELICIOUS!!  I love the green peppers and onions, they compliment all the food so well. Best tacos I have had so far, I love this place!!!!  Just wish it was closer to my house lol"
4,"Patti Mainini with Critter Sitter has been my dog walker for over a year.  Patti has been a blessing to my family, she takes care of my two dogs Buddy and Isabella.  She goes over and beyond to take care of my pets and my home.  She is extremely detailed with her messages regarding how each visit goes, if she detects a problem she calls right away.  Patti even takes out my trash and will wash my coffee cup in the sink, I have never ask her to do this for me.  I have seen first hand how she is with my dogs and I couldn't ask for more.  Patti is wonderful with them and they love her!  I highly recommend her to any and everyone to higher her as your pet sitter.  I love that when I go to work I know that my dogs are in great hands, that is a great feeling.  She has even done over night stays for me and she did an amazing job.  I whole heartily trust her and love what she has done for us.  I have had three other dog sitters and they don't even compare to her.  Hire Patti and you will be extremely happy!"
0,"It keeps getting worse! I finally stopped using them because they have four times been to lazy to put my dry cleaning and laundry on the truck by 1000 am even though it's always dropped off in advance of their cut off time. My husband needed his shirts so I decided to give them another try. SHOCKER!!!!! The lazy people they have working there who are to busy on their phones couldn't be bothered with processing our clothes on time. All you get is a smirk from these people. I have never seen such poor customer service ever! They sure take your money quickly but that's all they do. Never again!! The owner refuses to return calls and doesn't care about customers at all! Good luck if you ever use them! If you do get your clothes in time check for poor pressing, burn marks and ripped shirts near the buttons horrible!"
1,Since the owner changed several months ago their food has been very inconsistent. Not sure if they have different cooks cooking up whatever they feel like but some days the food taste ok and some days they taste bad. Our favorite thing to order was jajangmyun and tangsuyook but now the sauce is runny and tasteless. They also have raised the price and the quality and flavor has gone down. Top of that to make things worse they play k-pop music so damn loud it gets very annoying if you are trying to eat at the restaurant. We used to love their Korean Chinese food and eat here regularly but sadly won't be returning here any time soon.
4,Loved it!!!!!! We love all the Upward projects restaurants......... Fabulous service. Fun place. Intimate. Great food Great wine
0,"Based on the other reviews, I'm thinking maybe I went on an off day--I don't know! \n\nBased on my experience, I would say DEFINITELY don't go for the food. I got the shrimp scampi which was truly horrible. I thought, okay it's a bar maybe their bar food is good I should have known not to order something like shrimp scampi, however, my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and those were awful too! The fries were soggy and the fish was way over fried and tasteless."
0,"SOOO! Let me begin with; this franchise owner is a joke. SO! I was a member from 2008-2013 when I moved here from California, I found this place & asked to rejoin! STEVE the owner happened to be there and kindly reestablished my original agreement at 69$ for monthly unlimited spa. I was told I could go to fort apache AND green valley! Yay! Ha.. Long story short today I was informed by the AWFUL manager at GV (Julia) (and manager is a title she shouldn't have) stops me and informs me I need to pay for my cartridges. I told her Steve hadn't mentioned that and I had never paid, and to please call fort apache to check. Nope, she called Steve directly & gave me the phone. In the next 10 minutes he explained how I COST HIM ROUGHLY 50$ a month in fees from cartridges for spray tanning and basically said if I become an ambassador (something anyone can do) and refer 10 new members he will honor my agreement ?!!!?! Then apologized and told me the management at fort apache was poor. UMMM STEVE, you signed me back up ?! And if you're referring to yourself, poor is an understatement. He then spoke to Julia who became a nice human again (you don't fake kindness well Julia) and loaded my mystic and printed my ambassador materials. Great customer service guys. It's no wonder your business is failing. I wont be surprised to find you have to close your franchise in the future. So for those thinking of joining for 69-99$ monthly SKIP IT! Body Heat is 59$ and has 3 locations open 24 hours. Their service is incredible and the spray tans are unlimited any color:)"
3,"The family and I have been to this location numerous times since it has opened. The pizza (Barro's Special) has always been good and the beer cold. The service is sometimes spotty, but not terrible. It has recently improved. We always dine-in and have enjoyed ourselves. We do recommend to others to visit."
4,"Wonderful food, good service and great atmosphere. Go during the very long nice season in Phoenix and sit on the patio. Always opt for the food and drink specials.\nA fine place for kids, if you can keep them under control."
3,"\u00c7a manquait de brunchs sur mon blog gourmand (la boufferie), alors samedi dernier, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'aller bruncher quelque part... Le samedi, c'est un peu plus difficile de trouver un endroit ou aller manger le matin! Heureusement, les affam\u00e9s offrent des brunchs les samedis et dimanche. Moi qui pensait que ce n'\u00e9tait qu'un traiteur, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 bien surprise!\n\nL'ambiance aux conversations bruyantes et \u00e0 la musique subtile est parfaite pour commencer la journ\u00e9e. \n\nLe menu \u00e0 l'ardoise change r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Bien qu'il manquait de plats sucr\u00e9s quand j'y suis all\u00e9e, tout avait l'air tr\u00e8s bon. En effet, tout \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bon et IMMENSE! Vous n'aurez plus faim en sortant, c'est certain!\n\nLes cocktails sont d\u00e9licieux! Essayez le Apple pie aux jus de pommes et sirop de th\u00e9 cha\u00ef.\n\nLe service est souriant et accueillant."
2,"Not the greatest, but not bad, especially the tower rooms which are newer. The layout means that you are going to walk a lot from the parking lot to the rooms."
0,"I just had breakfast at More and paid $18 (with tax) and I feel that the Luxor should be ashamed of this place. The selection is incredibly sparse and bland. There are multiple stations with food, but they all have the same items: bacon, biscuits & gravy, breakfast potatoes, etc.. The only edible food available was the fresh fruit, and that's all I could eat after sampling the hot options. $18 for a banana and some melon. This experience has written me off of Las Vegas buffets; thank you More buffet."
4,This place is awsome! Very friendly staff and great food! If I lived in Arizona i'd come here everyday. Great experience.
4,We had the wild mushroom carpaccio which was exquisitly delicate.  Just the right amount of sweet and vinegar.  The sushi was quite fresh and the decor was wonderful with a nice view of the strip.  Service was also excellent.  Plus the people watching in the mall was an added bonus.
2,This my first time here. I have heard about it but not yet tried.\n\nThey had just started a buffet which always seems to attract my attention. \n\nBuffet was just average.  Limited choices for the price.  But the meat was very good.\n\nThis is a good place for a Gyro sandwich.  Not sure I will put it on top of my regular list.
1,"i came here for the Sunday brunch in July when my boyfriend visited me. i got the benedict arnold plate and he got wing ding dang plate.\n\nthe tofu scramble that comes with every meal tastes only of tumeric. not good. they need to throw some kala namak in there to give it more of an authentic egg flavor. the hash potatoes were okay - they really needed ketchup but no ketchup was to be found.\n\ni tried one of my boyfriend's wings and it was one of the foulest things i have ever tasted. there was way too much vinegar in the sauce. yet, he still somehow loved them. i'm convinced that boy has no taste whatsoever.\n\ni've never had nonvegan hollandaise sauce so i have nothing to compare it to, but the hollandaise sauce that came on my plate just tasted like mustard to me. which, i imagine, is not the way hollandaise is supposed to taste.\n\ndespite all this, the donuts are TO DIE FOR. I got a maple bar and ohhhhhh my god! it tasted just like the real deal! \n\ni don't know WHAT they make their canadian bacon out of, but it is the best dang canadian bacon i have EVER had! it tastes JUST like regular ham! \n\non your way out, they also have some refreshing complimentary cucumber water which i really enjoyed. \n\ni wish i could give this place more stars simply for being an all-vegan restaurant, but the food is either hit or miss. would i come here again? absolutely. but probably just for the amazing donuts and canadian bacon. :^)"
2,"There was a super long wait on Saturday morning. For all the hype, the food was ok, nothing crazy. The pancakes are ginormous and super dense. The sausage was really delicious, the bacon wasn't my fave. The inside felt like a darker, purpler Sizzler straight out of 1990. One more star just for having the sparkly fun and colorful rock crystal sugar in the sugar dispenser on the table."
2,"Great potential, could have been a 4 star, the food was good, the deviled egg appetizer was excellent, the wait for food and drinks was sooooooooooo loooooooooong, oh yeah and they were out of soco"
3,"Located on Sunset across from the airport, I've driven by Panevino plenty of times but didn't realize until recently that they had a separate space that serves as their cafe/deli. It's got the feel of an upscale cafeteria with plenty of tables and long counters with displays of food. They offer many choices of salads, soups, sandwiches, hot dishes and desserts that will satisfy carnivores, vegetarians, and vegans. Place your order at the counter and they'll call your number for you to pick it up when ready.\n\nTheir meat lasagna ($9.95) wasn't pretty, but the taste made up for it. The sauce was respectable and the meat savory and delicious. Too bad it looked like a jumbled pile of mess. The caprese salad was pretty standard and didn't disappoint. I finished of the meal with a slice of their chocolate fondant cake ($6), a very dense and rich layered cake with a creamy chocolate cream in between layers. Lunch wasn't cheap, but was a nice change of pace from typical fast casual spots in the area.\n\n3.5 Stars"
3,"I really dig this place. The salami with goat cheese and pesto was A+. They used a hearty portion of salami and you could tell everything was fresh and quality. \n\nI will be back to enjoy other sandwich choices, maybe then I can find it in my hearty to boost it one more star. \n\nOn a side note, the side order of pasta salads are delish. Most definitely made fresh daily. Good work!"
2,Prices are very reasonable. Room was clean. Off of the busy and ultra-touristy Strip and overall quality of the patrons is good. This a great place to stay if you do not like the Strip atmosphere [which can get pretty ugly at times] Family friendliness & coziness of the place top things off nicely. I do not approve of their buffet though because of selection and overall quality is on the lower end.
2,"I have no complaints about ATS, other than the high price to quantity ratio. It sits in a cute central phoenix location with a nice ambiance and a great patio. The food is fresh and tasty, however, portion size is rather small.\n\nNormally I would not portion size influence my rating, but when Phoenix has an abundance of inexpensive and amazingly delicious Mexican eats around, points will have to be deducted."
4,"Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal style. And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order.\n\nC. and I ate lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas. I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C. got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans.\n\nThat's one of the things I love about Culver's. Yes, it's a fast food restaurant. But they also do family restaurant food well. The chicken was good and the green beans really fresh, C. said. Fast food you can feel good about.\n\nI also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that. Chocolate custard with slivered almonds. Yummo."
3,"Definitely one of the best buffets in Las Vegas!  However, with this it is important to know it does not come cheap.  I dined here yesterday for brunch and several times over the last few years.  Sunday brunch starts at $31.95.    They have a great selection of food including: omelets, prime rib, french toast, pancakes, sausage, eggs, pizza, shrimp cocktail, sushi and the list goes on.  Everything they serve is fantastic and of quality.   I definitely think that the dinner buffet is better as they also include crab legs.  The desserts were just okay.  It can be hit or miss.  Lines are usually long.  If you are going here on a weekend expect long lines.  Thus, it is best to go early.  As for dinner, the lines are usually insane, so it is best to get there around 4-5pm to beat the crowd.  :)"
1,"The skins on the Bangers in the Bangers and Mash were very tough. The mash was very sloppy. The gravy not too bad. I had apple and rhubarb crumble for desert  which was dry and needed custard. All in all, expensive mediocre simple food. I'm disappointed Gordon."
4,"Absolutely best coffee in Madison, topped with a healthy serving of excellent service. Ambiance is perfect for studying (this is, in fact, my second home), hanging out with friends, reading a book by the fire, or conducting a business meeting. They have an excellent assortment of drinks (caffeinated and not) and food.\nSkip the poor-tasting, cookie-cutter Starbucks and experience some real coffee made by people who actually take pride in their job... and check out the latte art before you put your lid on--they're getting good! :)"
4,"One of the best nights of my life! I wish I could relive it over and over again! \n\nI have never danced so hard in my whole life. This is one of the only events I've gone to and been wide awake till sunrise. EDC is really an experience, one that is hard to describe in a review. All I have to say is JUST GO.\n\nParty safe, hydrate. Go with a group with positive vibes with a love for the music.  Dress comfortably and be yourself! Dance your face off!\n\nAlso: Thank goodness for shuttle service! I recommend an official EDC shuttle, 360Haus and JusCollege!"
3,"I demand that all Forever 21's immediately transform into huge superstores like this one. I have so much fun in here. I can spend hours looking for clothes and trying things on and then narrowing my picks once it comes time to pay. I love how they have different rooms that separate the style. Granted, F 21's clothes aren't made to stand the test of time but their apparel is priced accordingly. I've never left without buying a couple of things."
0,"If you read my previous reviews of this restaurant, I think you'll see that I've tried to be fair, even-handed. But today's experience was ridiculously frustrating. We sat down, ordered two Guinness pints to start. Then...the server returned and announced, \""We're out of Guinness.\"" I understand that this is a British -- not Irish -- pub, but to not keep Guinness on hand even in a British pub in America is appalling.  And since the server didn't know up front that they had no Guinness, I have to conclude that they don't consider this an important issue. The end of the story? We left and went to Sir Ed's, where the service is excellent and the Guinness always flows."
4,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the downtown phoenix area... Don't be tempted to eat too much for dinner since you will want lots and lots of room for the amazing crepe desert, go ahead get strawberry and banana .. You will not regret it!  \nPerfect date place as well, so cute and adorable..."
4,Great time and atmosphere. Had a nice table on the patio. Our waiter Chris gave us some great recommendations. The scallops were absolutely divine! As were the braised short ribs. Don't miss the mussels. They came in this light creamy broth that was OMG-good when dipped with the toasted bread. Wow!
0,Same crap but a different day and name with this place. Over price bad food that I wouldn't even feed my dog! Believe me I hate that dog! in fact I'm pretty sure I've had better dog down in Mexico then what these people try to pass off as meat! The service sucks and it's still not worth it even with getting a Groupon for 50 percent off. this place should have closed down years ago but apparently the people that own it have a very large farm up in North Dakota to sell us poisonous GMO corn which keeps the doors of this place open somehow! its not a local restaurant and it ran by people that live out of state but claim to be local because they bought a vacation home in power ranch.
1,You could do better a chain restaurant. Food and service are below average and they are not even that busy. Man where is an Outback restaurant in Urbana? I guess it's been here long enough so people send us strangers and visitors here but find somewhere else and do better than here. My second time and won't need to try again.
2,"3.5 Stars!!\n\nA couple of months back,  Gino's moved their a new location that happens to be very close to me.  After driving by day after day, I decided it was time to to give Gino's a try.  I read some Yelp reviews, looked up the menu online, then called in a take out order for a burger and a sandwich.  Fast forward thirty minutes and we were ready to dig in to our Memphis Mo Jo burger and Steinbrenner sandwich.  The burger was large and covered with an ample portions of chili, bacon and barbecue sauce (among other things).  It was delicious but decidedly overcooked.  The Steinbrenner (chicken parmesan) sandwich was wonderful.  The chicken cutlet was enormous and was smothered with the perfect quantity of red gravy (marinara) and cheese.  Four stars for takeout!\n\nThe night wore on, we imbibed in a few adult beverages and some music at Joe's.  \n\nThe next morning I woke with a headache that only a big breakfast could cure.  Gino's to the rescue!  Only 16 hours after our previous Gino's fix, we were out the door for round two.  We were seated promptly, but there was nothing else prompt about our meal.  Service was flat-out slow!  It was very busy and they were pitifully understaffed.  We ordered two bloody mary's, two waters and a glass of apple juice mixed with water.  The bloody's arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and they were awesome!  The waters and the juice for daughter didn't arrive for about ten minutes.  My husband's Eggs Benedict was delicious.  The breakfast buffet was hit or miss.  Biscuits, gravy, pancakes, french toast, bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, hash browns, home fries (and possibly a few items I have forgotten) were offered. The bacon, ham, and hash browns were hits for me.  In fact the bacon was wonderful, and I ate far more than I would ever admit....ever. :)  My daughter love the french toast and eggs. The biscuits were dry, hard and would have been more useful as hockey pucks.  The gravy was dull and lifeless.  The pancakes were reminiscent of the thin, flavorless, hot cakes offered at the golden arches.  Despite being shorthanded, the staff was friendly, and did their best to keep the table service moving.  Three stars for breakfast.\n\nI will be back for the awesome bloody mary's,  perfectly crispy bacon, and the unbeatable prices!"
3,"I could not be more excited about the new Mug Club!\n\n$75.00 gets you a year-long subscription with a hand crafted tankard. $1.00 off beers (and 4 oz. more!), an additional $.50 off on Mug Club Mondays and food discounts as well. \n\nMy absolute favorite local haunt. Don't miss Thursday Bike Night where your first beer is $1.00."
0,Been there a couple of evening and sat out on the patio area where the waitresses ignore you until you jump up and grab one even though she run ever table around yours. She wont even look at you when you wave at them. Had to go to the inside bar to order drinks instead and me snd my friend got sick drinking the overly sugary daiquiri and long island. Had to leave early after feeling sick but did finally wave down a waitress and get some chips.
4,"Great place to go workout or relax! Workout here every Tues/Wed/Thurs with the Marines at 0600. It's a perfect location to start a run, you can run around all or half of Tempe Town Lake, go through the hilly paths of Papago or even head down Mill to \""A\"" Mountain or ASU's Main Campus.\n\nThe scenery is great and there is a huge open grass area along with a playground and softball field. The bathrooms are kept very clean and there are consistently cleaning crews picking up and doing maintenance. It's a great place to go workout or relax.\n\nThe only downside is when there is going to be a big event because the parking lot is kind of small. At times to make matters worse, they've shut down half of it to accommodate for the crews setting up the events days before hand.\n\nOverall, awesome park... Thank you Tempe!"
1,"Food was great, but HORRIBLE service!\nWalked in the door, I wasn't even acknowledged for the first 5 minutes. Hostess was on the phone. Didn't even say \""hi\"" or \""be with you in a minute\"" I just stood there until 1 of the waiters finally sat me down.  I'm not gonna get into details. Just work on your service."
0,The food was delicious both times I ate at this restaurant but unfortunately I also got food poisoning both times. I ate there for dinner last night. I was up all night throwing up and rushing to the restroom. I had to leave work this morning. Disappointed to say I don't trust this place anymore.\nRamiro's on 107th and indianschool right next to brothers pizza is my go to spot. Never made me sick and the mini tacos are delicious.
4,Closest thing to New York style sandwiches I have found anywhere near Las Vegas. I had a corn beef/brisket sandwich on marble rye and it was melt in your mouth amazing. If you are in Vegas and want an awesome sandwhich - eat here!!
4,"Yum! One of my new favorite restaurants! \n\nMain Ingredient is a literally a house you walk into for a delicious meals. Is it really home cooked?  Close enough my friends.  I came here for lunch and ordered the BLT sandwich. I'm not much of a BLT sandwich guy but the thought of pork belly bacon raised my interest.  Needless to say I was totally satisfied. Mmmmmm...The bacon wasn't too crispy and it didn't fall apart like most bacon would when you take a first bite. The avocado was a perfect match. My mouth is watering talking about this BLT sandwich haha!  My friend order the Winner salad -- you can't go wrong with a name like that.  Turkey, salami and hardboiled eggs.  Seems pretty basis but definitely worth a try!\n\nService was real good and my water was quick to fill.  The place itself was full of different artworks.  The front yard is the patio, but not enough sunlight hits it so I decided to sit indoors. However, I'm sure I'll come back someday to sit outdoors.  HH all day Sunday! - Enjoy!"
0,Smelled like raw sewage in the parking lot. Wasn't greeted as we walked in and had to wander around aimlessly until someone finally saw us even though thr place was empty. To top it all off they were out of the ghost chili which is a key ingredient in their signature dishes. The waitress was slow and unapologetic.
0,When I cook and fail it's still better than Seasons 52. \nLooking for great food in upscale settings within a walking distance? Go to Hillstone just East of 26th st.
4,"Came for lunch. Ordered fried chicken and pork chops. Mac and cheese, apple sauce, and rice with gravy. Sweet tea and koolaid. We may as we'll have licked our plates. Everything was absolutely delicious. And everyone working was so friendly and welcoming. Thank you!!!"
0,"One Nevada is not an institution worth keeping your money at! First off, they do not have tellers to walk up to deposit your money; instead you have to deposit it in the ATM which is fine but if you need that face to face interaction that you sometimes need to deposit money - One Nevada lack this service. Far as I know they are only a few braches in town that offer this service of 24 locations. You next get penalized for having too much money in your account - My wife and I got this fee for having over 50k in our account, right now, we are in the process of moving to another financial institution. If you are going to do your banking - do it elsewhere if you plan on keeping over 50k in your account. This place really lacks the service that banks need to provide these days - good Customer Service! Take my advice and do not bank here!"
2,"Great food. I love their food. But I need to make this very clear for fellow dog lovers. Though this restaurant can be listed as \""dog-friendly\"" on some sites, they are more \""dog-tolerant\"" and that's being generous. We brought out puppy husky to have lunch on the patio since they were listed as a dog-friendly restaurant. We were informed as we were sitting down after already placing our order that out dog had to sit outside the fence next to the table. This was a nightmare. Since our dog was a puppy at the time he whined and whined and whined because he wanted to sit at our feet. He constantly tried to climb back over to sit at our feet and the manager continually walked by the table to check under and make sure our husky was not lying at our feet. It made me and my friends tired and anxious to not only listen to the puppies whining and having to push him back outside the gates but to see the little male manager come out again and again to check under our table. We ended up scarfing whatever food we had so we could get out. The waiter was very sweet about the situation but I ended up irritated because we couldn't have the slightest bit of leeway and have the dog lay down under the table quietly instead of less than one foot away behind the fence.\nBut other than that, great food and great service :P"
3,"We wanted to eat in \""Old Montreal\"" but the Hotel could not come up with a single recommendation in the old city.  We also wanted to eat outside.  We happened to walk by the Keg Steakhouse and Bar and first noticed the appealing patio.  We checked out the menu, decided to eat there and, we were not disappointed!!!  My husband had the Salmon with Mustard Sauce and it was delicious!!  I wasn't very hungry so just had the Spinach Salad with Strawberries, Pecans, Dried Cranberries and Blue Cheese and, a twice baked potatoe - YUM!!  We highly recommend the Keg especially if you want to sit outside!!  I did read the other reviews on yelp and agree about the wine list but, we felt that the food was really good at a price similar or better than other restaurants in Montreal."
0,"Food is good, service is horrible. Came from Encore beach club, wearing a 100dollar bathing suit with a dress cover we bought from the hotel and they turned us away because of their \""strict dress code\"" of no beach wear. We went to our room, changed and came back only to see tons of people in their restaurant dressed how we originally were...."
4,Chelsea was our bartender .  Not only is she a 10 but she's quick and friendly .  Thanks for doing a great job.  Im out here from Nor Cal.  GO GIANTS
3,"The best place for Apple product repairs and troubleshooting. Staff are more knowledgeable on average than Apple Store Geniuses. Great selection of external drives, and prices are very competitive."
3,"We were in the area and this was a new yogurt place for us, so we decided to try it...for research purposes, of course!\n\nOverall, it is really good. The yogurt has good flavor. I tried the Island Banana and Milk Chocolate. They have a good selection of toppings, including some that might be considered a little healthier (e.g., low-fat, non-fat).\n\nThe price seems comparable to other yogurt places.\n\nThe only addition I would make is that it would be great if they had access to complimentary water. That seems to be something that has left ice cream and yogurt shops. I get that they make money by selling $1 bottles of water. It just seems like you would have better customer service if you just gave water to your customers."
1,"This restaurant is the only \""real\"" one at the E Concourse in the Charlotte Airport. So I ate there, although I detest the Fox TV Channel which apparently supports this place.  I had the Turkey Applewood Bacon Ciobatta for $10.29. It's shown in the picture - the smoked turkey & cheese are hiding under the lettuce. The service was pleasant, but slow. Fortunately, I had plenty of time between flights. The meal was fine and not too large. Vacillating between 2 & 3 stars, I gave it 2, because it's Fox. Sorry!"
4,"I have tried MANY Chinese take out places. And have yet to find one whom comes close to \""NY style\"" until today. I order the shrimp lo mein and crab ragoons for delivery. The guy that took my order was a little stuffy at first and almost put me off ordering. But he turned out to be pretty helpful when i needed an opinion in portion size. Anyway, he quoted me 30 mins and the delivery guy was almost right on the dot! Now, the food. \n\nLet's just say. I have always ordered crab ragoons and they are typically very basic. But I always order them just kind of out of habit. I just started assuming they all tasted like Panda Express ragoons. But holy cow. These ragoons were AMAZING! I had to stop myself from eating the whole bag of 8 in one sitting. And the shrimp lo mein? Cooked to flippin perfection! Usually I expect to have over cooked shrimp, but no it was literally perfect. And the price was very reasonable. I'm so glad I decided to give them a shot instead of going with the other place that's really close to me that has Panda Express-ish food. I will GLADLY order from here again!"
4,"This restaurant is amazing! We started with the BBQ Shrimp & Oysters. Then my husband got the Shrimp & Grits. \n\nBut what satisfied me (and had flavors that I will continue to search for) was the Pappardelle Pasta with Wild Mushrooms. It had (and I quote from the menu) Fresh White Italian Truffles, Parmesan Reggiano, Vermont Butter and Local Chives. I can't wait to come back just to get this, but it was a special, so hopefully they will have it!\n\nThe staff was great too. Very helpful and not stuffy at all. I told our waiter I was craving pasta (which is limited on their menu) and he said they could make me a shrimp scampi on the fly.\n\nAnd I thought their digital wine list was so cool!"
0,"The bathtub and separate showers are nice, granite and tile, but the shower head and the towels are low rent. Other than this the tower deluxe room wasnt anythig special nothong particularly bad, just decent. If i wasnt hwre for work I would absolutely stay at least at the mandalay bay or nicer more mid-strip.  I had multiple problems with my keycard not working in the door, and an issue with my reservation thatr I called ahead to avoid and once there nothing was done and I was misinformed/lied too.  I will go out of my way not to stay here and make sure nobody else has to deal with their incompetence.  Too many bettere options to stay at on the strip to stay at the \""Sux\""ur."
2,This is the metro rail stop for those interested in visiting the roosevelt arts district. I've walked the stretch from here to the hi metcalf hostel when i've been in town. The place has new art galleries popping up and what look like small nightclub venues. Also quite a few wall murals dot the buildings on this stretch
2,"I actually give this 3.5 stars, I can't say that I'm officially a fan, but it's certainly better than just A-OK.  The place is always clean, the staff has always been friendly, (sometimes more than others, but it's difficult to get consistent help and even more difficult to keep them to the script) and they always have interesting flavours.  \n\nMy problem is they don't always have the flavours I want, which is, as I said, MY problem.  I don't mind trying new flavours but when I have a craving for the yummy Tart Raspberry, or the Creamy Mountain berry (I think that's what it's called) and/or the regular (full of sugar) Chocolate I want what I want and nothing else will work.  \n\nThe staff must think I'm crazy by now because I've walked in at least a half a dozen times, looked at the flavours and then walked back out again, disappointed and still craving the sweet tart Raspberry along with the rich Chocolate...ahhh wonder if they have it tonight!?\n\nHave you guys thought about a website or Facebook page (I see the location on 59th Ave is on FB) where you can list your daily flavours.  I'd be there every day you served the ones I like!!"
2,"What like about this place is the service.  Cold cut meats sliced as you order your sandwich and it goes right on your choice of bread.  The guy doing the slicing had an awesome customer service attitude; totally aggresive but also friendly.\n\nThe sandwiches were good.  If you need a quick bite for lunch I would say Mr. Goodcents is the way to go.  Don't expect anything too extravagant, its a sandwich...."
4,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Piper's Pub! This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, and my sister has to go here every time she visits. We love the Shepherd's Pie (I go for the beef version, and she loves the chicken). You can't go wrong with any dish here, though. I've had the English Breakfast (though never actually for breakfast!), the Vindaloo Curry (make mine spicy!), the corned beef, and many other dishes. I've never, ever disliked anything. My husband raves about the Guinness stew and the fish sandwiches. The chicken fingers are even awesome and the best I've ever had! Go here! You won't be disappointed!"
1,"I have been to this place several times I admit, most of the time its been out of desperation( that's when your stomach is growling, your family can't decide what to eat, you're looking for a place that's pretty cheap, have your cake & eat it too) although I try not to come here too often. Before you read my review take this into consideration, its $7 for lunch & $12 for dinner ALL YOU CAN EAT Asian-ish buffet....WHAT DO YOU ExPEct? Definitely NOT gourmet food!? THat would be one helluva KRAZY idea! In a nutshell salad looked unappetizing, chicken wings were good til I discovered it was because of the MSG that they use on it, egg drop soup tasted like scrambled eggs swimming in cornstarch soup, kalbi beef had an after taste as well as the baked green mussels ( I can taste/smell meats etc when they have been properly washed or cleaned, they have a certain stench to them even after they are cooked) the sushi looked unappealing and the fish did not look fresh, the desserts consisted of canned fruit of the lowest grade possible, almond cookies, chocolate mousse etc., they did have a chocolate & vanilla soft serve yogurt machine but bananas smothered with red sauce? Interesting.... At least they had sliced fresh oranges. They did have crab legs for dinner as well as seasoned crab pieces. The ok dishes for me were the chop suey, the pot sticker and the fried rice. Hey at least the food is edible...not a total waste of money. If you are looking for a place to just satisfy your hunger that is within your budget that can give you the variety you crave then you have come to the right place! Oh and by the way I think that buffet @ Asia has way more varieties and fresher more delicious food than here, it is more expensive though. Bon apetit!"
4,"Greatest wedding Dj! Had so many compliments after my wedding. Plays fun music, Taylor's the night to the guests. Would highly recommend"
2,"This place is sterile, and set up like a cafeteria.  The audio system is likely blaring Texas style contemporary country music. \n\nThe theme is Texas BBQ, not African-American, or North Carolina or Kansas City.  They have a system where you stand in line and tell the counter man what entree you want, plus a couple of side dishes, and he shouts it over his shoulder to the cook who plates it up for you on a tray.  Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink.  You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.\n\nBrisket is a specialty.  Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed.  They also do a sliced turkey.  Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.\n\nIts very casual, TV sets constantly going, of course, because this is America."
4,"If you are looking for great foot care, this is where to go!  From diabetic foot care to complex surgery, you are in great hands.  The staff is professional but personable.  I had a major foot surgery with excellent results.  Your feet will be in good hands!"
4,"What a wonderful surprise!  After living in Asia for several years, I came to love sushi.  I really didn't think I'd find anything here in Phoenix that could meet my high expectations.  But I did!  This place is great.  The owners are wonderful, one of which is the sushi chef.  I knew I was at the right place when we started talking about the documentary \""Jiro Dreams of Sushi\"".  The chef has actually eaten there and strives to provide his guests at Bento Box a wonderful experience too.  It is buried in a mall near Lowes...well worth the trip!"
0,"WOW, I have not been so disappointed in a restaurant in a LONG time.  The other reviews led me to believe that this was THE place to get good Thai in Vegas....and we were dying for good food, given that Vegas Thai and Chinese on Ogden had closed (boo).  \n\nThe wait was two hours...which was spent in the Griffin (see review), so that was fine.  Once seated (outside...it was heated, so that was fine too).  The Tom Ka Gai came out and it was absolutely perfect, so hopes were set high for a great meal.  Sadly, everything else out of the kitchen was just bland dreck.  We ordered every dish Thai native spicy...it came out like baby food.  When we mentioned it to the wait staff, we were told that this is their 'spicy.'  Honestly, it was the blandest, least flavorful mundane crap they could have slung on a plate.  The chicken was dry, the curry was just an overcooked orange mess.  BLECK.\n\nDO NOT buy into the hype - you are better off at Denny's."
4,"So I found Chand Palace by searching for \""Best Indian\"" on Yelp and I agree 100%! I was looking for a place to go with a group of friends with whom I recently traveled to India. This was my first Indian meal since getting back from our trip about a month ago and it did not disappoint. \n\nThe restaurant is cozy and full of great energy. Everything we ordered was very tasty, nicely spiced and well presented in nice serving bowls. The resto had the authentic feel of a typical hole in the wall Indian restaurant, but was a notch or two up the scale on presentation, cleanliness and decor. \n\nWe all loved the food and as we were leaving decided that we would be back to Chand Palace again soon to reminisce some more about our travels to India. All this for $11/person and it is a BYOB!"
4,"I've been here quite a few times and I ALWAYS end up getting breakfast. Fresh, perfect flavors and priced right are three ways to sum up Bertha's Cafe. The breakfast wrap with tomatoes, eggs, bacon, avocado and grilled balsamic onions is so good I don't have appropriate words. You always get a little surprise order of bananas, honey and oats with each breakfast purchase for FREE!! Do yourself a favor and try it out."
1,Overpriced.  Carne Asada fries is $9.16!  Carne asada chips is $8 (about $.50-1.00 more than most places)  The chips are already expensive.  Why does it cost an extra $1.16 to substitute fries?\n\nI had a california burrito.  It didn't have guacamole.  The first rule of carne asada is that it should always have guacamole.
0,"I was so excited about this place. So much so that I invited my best friend and brother to join me for my first time. We love waffles and thought if the name had waffles in it, it had to be good. Well, my friend and I  arrived first. It was hot inside and I mean the hot that you can't eat comfortable. While we waited for my brother, we ordered 2 small frapps, to cool us off, they cost over $10. Starbucks is not even that high. Plus they were not all that good. We also were able to see the waffles, which were small and took forever for you to get them after ordering them."
0,"They did an exceptional job.  My car went in completely filthy and came out virtually spotless and shiny.  I was impressed.\n\nSo, why only one star?\n\nThey stole all of my change that was in the cup holders.  Granted, there was only probably $5 total but still a very shitty thing to do.  \n\nNot coming back.  If you decide to go here, hide yo money."
4,"Best in the city, sushi at a affordable price. Owner gives a 20% military/veteran discount. \nThey can make sushi the way you like it. We love the tuna lover, and spicy tuna rolls. The place gives a welcoming feeling, and has a fun atmosphere.  Kids are welcome, its a chill environment,  I don't have to wear a tux and go broke to enjoy, fresh delicious sushi."
2,"Phoenix Sky Harbor is fine inside as far as airports go. Crappy, overpriced food options, the Hudson News, outdated carpeting...The usual. Apparently there are good restaurants in some terminals, but I've never seen them. I have typically traveled at off peak times of day, so my time going through security isn't too bad. I've yet to get patted down or searched, so it's been OK from that standpoint. \n\nMy big beef with Sky Harbor is the drop off/pick up situation...It's a complete cluster. It's giant, and quite confusing. If you're new to the area and need to get to the airport and pick someone up, good luck. \n\nIt's right in the middle of the city so it's convenient to get to, but not convenient at all to navigate. If I'm ever lucky enough to fly into or out of a terminal with the great food I keep hearing about, maybe I'll update my review."
4,"I don't normally do reviews on places other than restaurants, however, Maricopa Wells is an exception to my rule simply because of how great this vets office is. In fact, I have been meaning to do this review for awhile now. We used to take our dogs to a vet in Mesa but needed something closer since we live in Maricopa. I must say that Maricopa Wells is perfect for us not only in terms of location but in terms of price, hours, and the staff is fabulous with our animals. Every time we have gone, the staff has treated our little doggies so great and they always manage to fit us in even when we have no appointment. They are open from 7:30 AM to 8:00 PM on most weekdays and they are open on both Saturdays and Sundays. Its great for working pet owners because you can drop off your pets before work and pick them up after! Also, they allow you to kennel your pet for a daily fee (which was pretty reasonable) and they will accommodate any requests you have for the animals while they are staying there. Our little chihuahua had parvo and needed to be medicated several times a day for several days. Our pug Winston had an eye condition and needed to be medicated several times a day as well. We work so taking them to Maricopa Wells and having this handled was very convenient. Yes, their prices may be slightly higher than other vets (our other vet was a little cheaper) but if you live in Maricopa, its a great place to take your pet and their hours kinda make up for the little extra you pay for their services. My husband and I love Maricopa Wells and so do our furry little friends  :)"
4,"Fantastic dentist and staff. Professional, skilled, friendly and efficient, I highly recommend this dental practice."
0,"DON'T EAT HERE IF AN OLD INDIAN/MAYBE LATINA WOMAN IS WORKING THE CONDIMENTS!!!! \nI was making my second trip here during my Vegas vacation on a slow, Sunday afternoon. When I got my order it was wrong. No big deal, just needed a bun swap (I HATE MAYO!!!) and different condiments. I brought the burger back and asked to get a new top bun. THE LADY PROCEEDED TO WIPE OFF THE TOP OF THE BUN WITH A WET, DIRTY, RAG, AND WAS READY TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME! Who does that???  \nWhen I confronted the lady and her manager, she flat out denied what I just saw in front of my face. On top of that she denied taking our receipt too! What a shame! On top of all of this, the f*%$ head manger gave me tons of attitude after I demanded a refund. I had so much love for this place before, but what did I ever expect from a fast food place on the Strip? Good luck eating here. I hope to revive my love affair for the Fatburger establishment one day, but not on Las Vegas Blvd."
1,"If you have been to the Ditka's in Chicago, do not eat here. You will be sad. Very sad. This Ditka's is a very poor imitation of the original. The hostesses really should be looking at careers in the prison system."
4,"I went to these guys today after over 3 years of not seeing a dentist. I have severe anxiety when it comes to visiting the dentist. Unfortunately I had a broken tooth giving me severe pain. I emailed Cheryl on Sunday night explaining my issue and they got me in right away Monday morning for X-rays and I then returned an hour later to have the work up done for my crown. I explained to them I would need nitrous oxide or something else to help me not freak out. I also told them that I have had difficulty in the past getting areas of mouth numb and staying numb. Dr. Barela did an excellent job of putting me at ease, numbing the area and getting me relaxed with the nitrous. The hygienist Chris did an excellent job with my cleaning and X-rays. Overall I had an excellent experience and will be returning!!!! ;) If I could give this place more stars I definitely would!!!!"
0,I live in DC but come to Vegas a lot for work.  The DC location is one of my favorite restaurants.  This location is awful.  The service is subpar and dishes which are great at the other location aren't at this location\n\nThe fried chicken in DC is wonderful with a special mustard sauce.  The chicken at this location is just a dry plain chicken breast.
2,"In town to visit family, and we went to Fresh Mint for lunch. First off, the decor is a bit \""in your face.\"" Bright and odd. The \""strip mall\"" references made by other reviewers are accurate. \n\nService was S.L.O.W. until the man, who I think owns the restaurant, showed up to save the day. Still, it took a long time to get our food. \n\nWe shared the summer rolls, which I think were below average. The wrappers were a bit mushy and I found the rolls to lack flavor. We also got some fried rolls (can't remember the name, but they had yucca root in them... Imperial Rolls maybe?) and they were pretty tasty. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu lunch special. The salad was average \""bag\"" salad, but I liked the dressing - flavorful with a kick. The tofu was yummy - in a curry coconut milk sauce - but it was ONLY tofu. I actually love tofu, but I was hoping for a few veggies. I would not order this again w/o requesting they add some broccoli or something. Just too rich of a dish for my taste. My brother got the kung pao chicken which looked Delicious. My husband had pad thai, which was pretty good. \n\nThis place was definitely expensive. I was surprised, visiting from the Bay Area, that prices at this place, which resembles a semi-fast food establishment, were so high. Lunch for 6 of us was almost $100."
1,"I had a lunch box special \""Kalbi\"" $9.95. I guess you can't expect a lot for $10 lunch nowadays. Miso soup was too thin, I can make better miso soup. Salad was too plain, California roll had a very little rice, a pot sticker was......Trader Joe's pot stickers are better. Kalbi was good, very tender and tasteful. Probably I won't eat here again."
2,I have to frequent this locaiton for work almost on a daily basis... And what can you say about a post office besides.. LINES LINES LINES...... i am giving them 3 stars because they have not lost any of my packages yet.. The day that happens I am going postal and ripping away some stars.!!
3,"I've used Tix 4 Tonight twice and have saved some money while doing so.  Both times was at the Fashion Show Mall location.  But the trade off was that I spent a good amount of time waiting in line.  The first time I used it was to get Nathan Burton tickets when he was performing at the V Theater at the Miracle Mile Shops.  I didn't exactly know how it worked at the time so when I received the discount voucher for the show, I hustled all the the way to Planet Hollywood to make sure that I would get an actual ticket.  Fortunately, I was able to use the Monorail to get there halfway.  What was cool was that when I got to the ticket booth, they honored the voucher and asked if I wanted to upgrade to VIP admission for $10 more.  I took that offer and got the VIP tickets for the General Admission price.  Sweet upgrade!\n\nThe second time I used it was to buy tickets for Blue Man Group.  Once again, waited about 30-40 mins and then bought the best discount seats they had for the night's show.  I saved about $20, so the discount wasn't really huge, but that's lunch buffet at Paris so not too shabby.  The funny part was that I thought they had given me vouchers again, but they were actual tickets this time.  So I ended up running to the Venetian to try and 'redeem' these tickets.  That was a waste of energy.\n\nTix 4 Tonight can give you mixed results, but if you can spare yourself some time and patience, and a little running, you can really end up with some great deals."
3,"They have a killer happy hour.  We usually get take out but dining in is good too.  I recommend the 4th of July pizza.  Good hot wings, cheese steaks, and grinders.  Always good service.  Killer happy hour."
2,This Petco is hit and miss and can be frustrating when you stop for a specific product and they are out of it just like today. I also informed an employee in the aquatic department about two fish that I bought here at different times that both died after a short time. I have a lot of fish and only the fish I have purchased from this store have died! \n\nI will just continue to by my maintenance items needed for our 75 gallon Aquarium however will not purchase fish ever again from this store.\n\nThe staff is friendly and the store is clean and the location is close to my home so I will continue to shop here for convenience reasons. \n\nI also like that their exchange and return policy is lax because they guarantee product purchases. I have bought things for my Aquarium that did not work and they will refund or exchange with no questions asked.
3,"Driving up and down the 101 in Scottsdale, I watched as the new tower for the Talking Stick Resort rose majestically from the desert.  Well, this Saturday it was time to check out Orange Sky, their fine dining restaurant on the 15th floor.\n\nWinding our way through the noise and smoke of the casino floor, we were able to find the bank of elevators that whisked us up to Orange Sky.  We entered the bar area and were greeted by panoramic views.  The golf course and mountains to the east and Phoenix and Camelback Mountain to the west.\n\nThe decor is very modern and contemporary.  Kind of a minimalist style that I really like.  We ordered a drink and watched the sunset.  An orange sky, indeed!\n\nAs we walked back down a long hallway to the dining area we noticed a few private booths for two people that faced west and looked like a nice romantic seating option for our next visit.\n\nThe menu was pretty straight forward with plenty of meat and seafood options.  I ordered a rib eye steak which was huge and cooked to medium rare perfection.  The smoked cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus sides were very good also.  My girlfriend had the shrimp cakes which were shrimp wrapped around scallops with bacon.  It's pretty hard to go wrong with that combo!\n\nThe service was good and the dining area was very attractive.  Afterwards we walked outside and noticed that there was a large patio for dining as well.\n\nOn the way back out through the casino I played a couple of slot machines and actually won!\n\nLike T Cook's, Prado and Deseo I think this restaurant is good enough that it will attract local diners as well as the resort guests.\n\nAll in all, our group really enjoyed the experience at Orange Sky."
2,I had the lemon pie and it tasted amazing.
3,"Can't believe that I have not tried this place yet...right around the corner from my house! What a little gem.\n\nFood was great (we had breakfast) - great selection of bagels (all were fresh). I would and will be going back. This is my new quick stop place! They are FAST at filling orders too.... so no wait time! And, as others have mentioned --- the bagels are HUGE!\n\nLOST STAR - the sitting area was not \""clean\"". I had to clean my own table. This is hot button for me. I expect to be able to come in, order, and sit down at a clean table. The place was not that busy - so they just need to come out and clean every once in a while."
3,"Crowded during the peak times with really slow service. Recommend off peak times, especially if you have kids like we do. Scallop Dynamite is really good and so is the King Crab tempura."
3,"If you get Dennis as your waiter, you're in for a treat!\n\nA group of four had lunch here and a great time!\n\nWe liked the cheese appetizer, good selection and fresh!\n\nThe French Dip was magnifique!"
1,"I stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of Saturdays ago.  Upon entering the hotel we noticed that they had won a single diamond star 2010 and my fiance followed up with that by asking what has happened since then.  The lobby of the hotel seemed to be pretty nice and check in was quick and easy.  Our room was on the second floor and upon entering I was surprised at how small it was.  It reminded me of hotels over in Europe and barely had room to move around in.  We weren't planning on spending much time in the room and so I didn't pay much attention to it.  I guess that I should have paid more attention to the name of the hotel though as that could have been a clue.  As we were leaving the room and headed toward the elevator we noticed a vending machine that was probably 90% empty.  Odd but it seemed to fit with the rest of the dingy decor of the place.  After we got back to the place and my fiance climbed onto the bed it immediately sunk down pretty far.  Not a good thing.  In the morning we ended up checking out early and skipping the free breakfast as we were happy to get out of there.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't stay here again in the future.  Yes, this place is cheap but I would rather pay the extra money and stay somewhere else that feels cleaner and has some more room."
3,"Many moons ago my make up of choice decided to discontinue the shade of liquid foundation I used. I was having a hard time finding something else that was close to the color and felt light on my skin.\nI saw their sign one day after shopping at Smiths and made an appointment for a free make over. They did a great job, and I still use their liquid foundation and blush to this day.  Their makeup doesn't feel heavy and it's gentle on my skin. Price is probably on par with most department store cosmetic counters. \nTheir employees are always friendly and helpful. They have my info on file so I don't have to remember the shade that I buy, they look it up for me. It's convenient too, I don't have to worry about going to the mall. They occasionally have specials too, where if you buy 2 products you get a gift. That's always nice!"
3,"AWESOME first experience horseback riding! It's $55 for 1.5 hours and $65 for 2 hours. Definitely take the 2 hours to get the full experience. Since most of us are beginners, we didn't get to gallop through the dessert like I wanted to. I guess it would hurt too since cacti are all around. Remember to wear closed shoes (duh) because I didn't and I had to be uber careful that a cactus didn't go through my toe.\n\nAnyway, they don't really prep you too much which is good so they don't waste your time. They just let you know how to steer and control the horse. You ride in a line so that the horses know where to go. You roam through the dessert and the best part was going through the water. The horses were so obedient and trained that nothing went too off course. The horses will want to randomly eat, pee, or take a fat dump so you may randomly jolt to a stop!\n\nBesides going through water, the best parts were the uphills so the horse would gallop up!! That's when you finally get what you wanted, bouncing up and down on the wild beast with your butt flying up!! \n\nGreat guides and beautiful place. Lots of horses. I was teamed with my buddy BJ. I miss BJ.\n\nYeee-haww!"
1,"Over-rated. Maybe it was a slow night, but the place was a let down. Expensive drinks, in-your-face bouncers, and an average crowd with a 3 -2 male to female ratio... A waste of a $20 cover."
0,"I work off of 16th and really wanted a panini. Usually I would go to Fresh & Easy for their mozzarella sandwhich; but, yesterday I wanted a hot one. You know... toasty bread kind. \n\nSeeing as how I was pressed for time, I needed some place I could call in my order and just pick up. Doing a quick iphone yelp search I found nothing. So, I went with what I knew. Sauce. \n\nThis review is strictly based on my panini experience. I have had their pizzas, which are pretty good. But, after going there yesterday, you may have to drag me to go back to this place! \n\nThe only non-meat option is the grilled cheese. At $6, it is a bit pricey... but I was willing to take the hit b/c I was craving. I phoned in my order, and added some arugula and tomatoes b/c lets face it... just cheese... boring. \n\nI get there. My total was almost $9!!! NINE DOLLARS! I was floored! I was charged a dollar for a slice and a half of a tomato! Not even a juicy slice!!! A paper thin one!!!!!!! And, of course, another dollar for arugula! \n\nTo put the nail in the coffin, the \""panini\"" - more of a toasted sandwhich - was so small!!! Maybe like 4 x4. I wish I could post the picture I sent to Joanna E. The sandwhich was the size of my coin purse!!!!!! \n\nI cannot believe it. WHAT A RIP OFF! \n\nI will not be returning. They cheated me. I hate cheaters!\n\nUPDATE: \nCheck out the pictures. Joanne E. posted for me. THANKS!!!"
2,"This place is located in Hotel Bally, really high end for a asian joint. I love how the seating which creating an illusion your sitting on the floor like Japanese style\n\nIf you craving Pho, this is the spot.  I had the Pho with Steak & Beef balls however it was so expensive like $18-20 a bowl.\n\nThe broth was really good however my rare Steak tasted wierd - not in a good way.\n I was really hungry  so I dipped the meat  with the hosin/sirracha which help cover the funky taste.\n\nMy friend ordered the Duck Soup and Love it!  He is a lite eater and I couldn't believed he finish the whole bowl (It was that good)\n\nI would comeback again only because it's the only pho in this area."
4,I Can't get enough of this place.\nHome made tortillas.\nGreen sauce on everything.\nAs healthy as you want to make it! \nHome made tortillas!\nThe lines move fast.\nMmmmmmmmm.\nHOME MADE TORTILLAS!!\n\nYou must eat here!!!!
3,"If you want real Chinese food, ask for the Chinese Chinese menu.\nOtherwise, you will have your typical American Chinese menu. \nWe went there twice we thought it was good. We would recommend the \ndry scallop, egg white fried rice, it's exceptional!"
2,"There's some decent food trucks in this town, and if you want to get a chance to try some out, it's a great place to do it.  But with a festival comes a lot of foot traffic, which means there's lines at the best food trucks.  And are you really going to eat at more than 1 food truck?  I'm full after 1 meal, so I'm fine hitting up a food truck at a non-StrEATs location.  Great activity for people under 21, though, with free bands and entertainment."
3,"Green Acres is the place to be! Green Acres is the place for me! Land spreadin' out so far and wide! Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside!\n\nNot so much.\n\nI tend to expect marginal or generic experiences when I visit our Champaign office. That way, I'm never disappointed. And sometimes--just sometimes--I am pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe I Hotel pleasantly surprised me. It is a nice, \""typical\"" boutique style hotel,  incongruously set against the rural back drop of the UIUC campus. Yes, the \""I\"" is truly the \""champagne\"" of Champain hotels. And, yes,  I did just write that. Oh yes, I did. \n\nThere is hardly any parking around the university, so having both a FREE parking lot and FREE (yes, I said free) shuttle service that will take you places and even pick you up is pretty darn amazing. (You do need to reserve the shuttle in advance by calling the front desk.) \n\nThe staff seem a little befuddled. Like they are actors playing the role of \""Staff At An Upscale Boutique Hotel\"" and they just can't wait until they get off work to go kick it at the Hooters. But again, I'm not complaining too hard, since when I visit our Champaign office I always feel like I am Eva Gabor in Green Acres. \n\nYes 4 stars. They are contextual stars because if the I were anywhere else, I'd be all been there done that."
0,"Got to Vegas late night on a Thursday night and was wandering the Strip after Moon looking for something to get in to. It was almost 4 AM when we stumbled into this place for $5. All it had going for itself was the music, everything else was horrible. They have speakers outside too, might as well party on the sidewalk for free and save yourself $5.\n\n1/2 a star for the music, 1/2 a star for the bad ass female at the exit who should have been inside."
0,"The waffles are like sponge and the chicken was over-fried and the service is bad. The owners are very arrogant, unprofessional and rude. Before I patronized the restaurant I heard things that were not good and boy did I experience what I heard and then some. ROSCOE's Chicken and Waffles from California would put them out of business if they don't do it themselves. Enough said!"
0,"BJ brew house located at Charleston\n\nservice sucks, we waited 20 minutes to drinks and 45 minutes for food. waitress was too busy with too many tables to provide adequate service. Rib eye steak was very fatty. Do not take BJ coupons to this location, they will be not accepted."
3,Dinner: had Dosa and Baigan bartha. It was good. \nLunch buffet: was also good.
4,This is the first time I have been here and it was great. The staff was very nice and welcoming I didn't have to wait. The nail shop was clean. They ofter me water. I took in a picture of what I wanted and they were happy to do it. The lady that did my nails did a very good job. Julie is the lady to see she does great nails. I definitely Will be going back!
1,"Every time we are at downtown Chandler, my husband and I talk about this place.  \""We still haven't tried the new steakhouse\"".  At first I saw all the negative reviews and didn't want to go anywhere near it.  Then, as their star average improved, I added it to my huge bookmark list.  We still didn't end up going there for a several months because I was waiting for a time when we were properly dressed.  It seemed like a classy kind of place.  I always peeked in there wistfully as we walked around the corner to Paletas Betty, eyeing the candlelit white linen tables, well dressed couples sipping martinis at the bar and catching a few notes of jazz music wafting out the front door as the pretty hostess in her little black dress opened it wide while greeting patrons.\n\nOur actual experience there did not live up to these expectations.  When you look a little closer, you see there are paper placemats on top of those crisp white linens.  And the smooth jazz music gets overwhelmed when the restaurant is more than half full and is absorbed into the annoyingly loud din in the place.  And the bar?  No draft beer, the bottles they do have are $5 a piece (and they must store them warm b/c the hubby got one that was so skunky he could barely finish it) and the markup on the wine list (by the glass options) was high.  I paid $10 for a glass of something that would cost $16 a bottle retail.\n\nI am giving them an extra star because my fillet was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  But this may be due to the fact that I always order my steak medium well.  From the other reviews, it looks like if I had wanted it rare I would have been out of luck.  The sweet potato fries that it came with, however, were bland and undercooked.  A huge disappointment since I really love sweet potato fries.  These tasted like they came frozen in a bag.  And the generic, supermarket brand bag, not even Alexia or the ones they have at Trader Joes.  Don't even get me started on the salad.  A sad little pile of extremely wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple of slices of cucumber and some croutons.  I know it is a steakhouse and so most people are just there for the meat, but seriously it was pathetic.  One of their specials that night was that you could add a small lobster tail to any steak for just $10.  I was super excited about this since I LOVE lobster.  It was served out of the shell, always a plus, and with both a lemon wedge as well as drawn butter.  Unfortunately, no amount of butter could drown out the overwhelmingly salty taste of the piece of rubber in the shape of a lobster tail that was on my plate.  I wanted to complain to my server but she was MIA for most of the meal.  By the time she reappeared we just wanted to get out of there.  I doubt we will return."
2,"My family and I decided to try this place out last night. It's located right next to Carlos O'Brien s, has a nice parking lot layout.  The place is decorated with a Hawaiian theme with flat screens playing surfing videos. \n\nWe ordered with the gal at the front counter and she was SUPER nice and giving recommendations on drinks and such but didn't really tell us what to expect or how the routine was. We didn't realize that you're supposed to get your own silver, napkins, condiments, etc. \n\nWe ordered 3 mains, 3 appetizers, and 2 beers and a tea, and the bill before tip came to over $82.00 which gave us all a little shock. We didn't have a problem with the bill; most places in Scottsdale are about this price BUT usually, the places that charge $20 or more per person also include table service and a set table. \n\nWe had the calamari appetizer, the coconut shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, fish & chips, and a chowder. The calamari was excellent, the coconut shrimp was very decent (good dipping sauce-sweet/spicy but I suspect frozen). My dad loved his tacos, my mom not so much (she felt like they could have put more fish and less fluff cabbage on it, especially since you're paying over 10 bucks for just two tacos). I loved my fish (great breading on the mahi!) but the chips were obviously frozen shoestring potatoes that they had fried up on order. Don't get me wrong, they tasted decent enough but maybe they shouldn't say everything is made from scratch when it isn't....My husband thought the chowder was nothing special as it tasted like canned chowder soup that they had tossed previously frozen seafood bits into and doctored up. My folks couldn't stop raving about the beers though!\n\nThe food was out to us in under 10 minutes after ordering which surprised us as the dining area was full of people. We had food runner (maybe a supervisor of sorts?) who was nice enough to grab silver and etc for us but he was BAKED. (red eyes, delay in reaction, awkward interactions-the guy was not only baked but was something closed to SUPER baked :P). The guy was really nice but it was pretty darn obvious. \n\nThe food was really good but the casual atmosphere just doesn't match the price points that they have going and almost serves as a deterrent from going on the regular. I would hate to see this place close due to greedy prices but I fear that's the path they are taking :/"
0,"After emailing my experience to Food -4-Less I get this email and have yet to hear back from any store manager. I just dont get it they expect consummers to come back to be treated bad and, feel like the bad guy. I will continue to avoid Food-4-Less and is I see a sale in there add and just take it to Walmart for the price match.

4,"I just got the house coffee, and it was mighty tasty. I loved the calm and friendly atmosphere. I wish I could have hung out longer. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
4,"Had a couple of meals while RV camping nearby. Excellent food and a wonderful mom & pop restaurant. Staff is eager to please, and the fish tacos are grilled to perfection. There is a nice outside seating patio when the weather cooperates."
2,I use this location frequently because of its location being the closest to my work.  The traffic to get in and out is consistently bad.  The set-up of the drive through is an accident waiting to happen.  This location seems to have more inconsistent quality in their drinks than others I have been to.
4,"Easily my favorite nightclub in Vegas.  This place is beautiful and has an amazing layout. I love the openness of it , so even when it gets packed (and it will) it's not as bad as most clubs. I love clubs that are connected to an outside area. In this case,  you have access to the pool area and pool bar. The best part is putting your tired aching feet in the water, or you can lounge by the pool beds. I'll definitely go back!"
4,Had the best time with our group of 11 ladies watching the show.  Marcus does a great job playing to the crowd of ladies. If you have time stay after the show to get your picture the the fellas!!!!!
2,"Different...but in the vein of Pei Wei and Noodles & Co.  Enjoyed my Vietnamese Crunchy noodles with shrimp and asked for extra hot sauce. Essentially had a deep fried dish with some veggies stirred in and the hot sauce is like a sweet & sour salsa.  Like I said, different. Spouse had yellow curry chicken, it was fair but I would have needed a lot more hot sauce. We also got crab rangoons which were really good. The sauce for the rangoons was sweet and gingery. Would love to try more items here."
2,"The food is average, and the staff and service were kind of blah. I have been to this place one time, and I haven't been back. It's a little grubby inside, and everyone seems sorry to be there...staff as well as patrons. It's not the kind of upbeat place you'd expect from a micro-brewery type of spot. I like this little area of Matthews, too, so I really expected more.\n\nMy expectations were dashed!\n\nIt's a spacious facility, though, so it's a great place to go for groups or when you don't want to wait in line."
3,"Excellent quality sushi and sashimi.  I was a little disappointed in the mix of the specialty rolls which weren't really to my liking, but the sunomono salad, eel and hand roll i ordered was perfect.\n\nI sat at the bar, which seemed a bit undermanned with only 2 bartenders."
0,"I hate to say it, but this is some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Edible?  Sure.  Mexican?  Not a chance.  My hopes were high; with a name like \""Two Hippies,\"" I thought it would be a funky little place that served addictive street tacos... (I've never actually had *authentic* street tacos, but I KNOW they're not supposed to taste like THAT.)  \n\nMy friend tried the three taco combo; one carne asada, one green chili, and one fish taco - all on the low end of mediocre (though she couldn't even stomach the fish taco).  My burrito tasted like they wrapped bland beans, rice-a-roni, boiled chicken breast, and one ton of chopped onions inside a Mission tortilla.  Don't get me started on the chips and salsa either... Mission and Pace for sure...\n\nThe horrible part about all this is that the service was REALLY wonderful!  I think it was one of the owners who served me, and it was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had service-wise.  She had a distinct Midwestern charm; unfortunately, that's also what the \""Mexican\"" food at Two Hippies suffers (severely) from.  \n\nVERDICT: Go to Rosita's or Juan's instead...\n\n(In response to Bryan L's callout:  1)  Yes, I'd take Bertos [or ROSITAS, or JUANS, or Chipotle] anyday over Two Hippies Beach House, and I'm not afraid to say it.  And 2) Everybody [staff and kitchen] speaks English at Two Hippies because they're white as ghosts.  It's like eating at a Chinese restaurant owned and run by Wisconsins.  When English is NOT the primary language of an ethnic restaurateur, to me that's a wonderful sign.)"
0,Open 24 hrs yet at 230 am only one checkout is available...You have the capability of offer self checkout and yet have the area closed off..
1,"This safeways carries all the usual staples.  Nothing outstanding there.  The major fault I find is that it carries only lower end stuff in it's deli.  I stropped by once and asked for their top brand salami soprsata and the woman said they not only didn't have it, she'd never even heard of it.  \nAnother incident that shouldn't have happened was in the bakery.  I asked the difference between two kinds of breads with \""meant to impress\"" names and the baker couldn't tell me.  Her answer was that the difference was in ingredients.  Well, no kidding!\nI usually go to the Safeway on Glendale for Safeway specific items that I want now.\nSpeaking of bakery.  Last time I was in there the rolls (not bulk) were scattered around in the different bins.  Some look like they'd been torn from their sister rolls from the bakery instead of cut.  Consequently, one roll has a large shard of bread attached to it and the other is short that amount.\nWonder about the sanitation also when customers are allowed to fondle the bread and then put it back in the wrong bins.  I don't see that as Safeways problem but a problem perhaps of the quality of customers who enter the store."
1,"Letttuce wrap, and hot and sour soup was good. My Vietnamese crab salad was neither Vietnamese nor a salad. It was cold stale noodles with hardly noticable crab, spinkles of fruit and no sauce, yet it was almost the highest priced lunch item. A restaurant with real vietnamese food wouldn't be caught dead serving such fakery. Please take it off the menu. Worse than cafeteria food."
2,"La Pinata has a kick ass sign!!\nThe place inside is pretty lack luster and drab.\n\nMargaritas are decent but not as good as some of these rave reviews.\nBig portions of food but still kind of over pricey for what it actually is.\n\nHusband has a tasty green tamale, decent cheese enchilada and so-so beef taco.  I got the black bean and rice burrito, big in size, beans very bland.\nWe got a green chile cheese crisp to start, that was good, they have a good cheese blend.\n\nOur service was fantastic so he got tipped very well.  Good service is hard to come by.\n\nAs for Mexican food, Rositas on 22nd and McDowell is still my favorite for food and margs.  Not affiliated with any other Rositas in the valley."
3,"What a great place to sit and eat where portion sizes are big, prices are reasonable and service was out of this world. I liked being off the strip away from the chaos for a while. Gave me a feeling of home!! Thank you!!"
4,"I had an excellent experience here. My taillights were tinted and I needed to remove it. I was greeted when I walked in and explained my situation to one of the associates. He came outside on a really hot day to check out the specific type of tint I had on my car and made recommendations. I ended up only needing to purchase a razor blade item to scrap everything off. \n\nIf you have any questions about your car, these guys are incredibly helpful and will make sure you find what you need to get the job done."
3,The old fresh mama. Super good food. Get the veggie skewers. Can't wait to see what they can do when they expand. Will be back
1,"The rooms are fantastic and very spacious for sure.  But the service for a hotel that is supposed to be amazing is HORRIBLE.  Everything takes WAY too long and the front desk clerks are frighteningly stupid.\n\nThe concierge was actually quite good - but even her good work cannot make up for the complete lack of ability of every single other staffer at the hotel during my stay.  I was really looking forward to being here because its supposed to be the best.  But from the sub-par bartenders, to the overly incompetent front desk people to the almost laughable restaurant staff, I would say save your money and go anywhere else.  \n\nThis hotel, despite its outward beauty, is pretty much a complete and total lousy place to stay."
4,"I've been going her for a few years now and it was good before but now their EXCELLENT!!! They have recently hired a new chef Harold (Haru)  he was fast and attentive.  He cut some gloriously thick slices for the Nigiri, Maguro, Salmon & Yellow tail! The food that comes out of the kitchen is all well prepared, and I recommend the tasty green mussels but I go for the sushi\nFor an all-you-can-eat-in-under-an-hour kind of place, the fish is always fresh. \nChatting w/ Harold he asked me what I liked and how spicy I like my food & after 2 of the menu rolls he asked if he could make me something off the menu I told him cool do your thing. it was AMAZING!!!! He calls it a mother w/ child (salmon on the outside w/ salmon roe a delicately sliced lil piece of lemon) after that he was free to make me what he wanted and after that decision I have never had so many total melt-in-my-mouth moments.\nConsidering the quality of Harold's work, the A.Y.C.E. hour is the way to go.  \nBut be careful.  By the time I was ready to leave, I thought I was going to burst because i could not stop eating and when i finally did I remembered that rice expands in your stomach.......SO AGAIN BEWARE!!!\n\nThe only thing bad I can say about Sushi Tachi is don't go on Wed or Thurs (Harold's nights off)"
4,"Was in the area so decided to stop in, glad we did! Great food and coffee and very friendly staff. We will definitely be returning very soon!"
0,"Awful.  Music was not blues but bad garage band rock.  Doesn't start until 10.30pm even on weeknights which is not necessarily bad but strange.  Most clubs are on their 2nd or 3rd set by then. I was put off by the nickel and diming.  They make you check your coat and charge $2 for it.  Meanwhile, we saw several people who hadn't checked their coats. We were told at the door that we could put our cover on the tab and pay w/ credit card.  After we got some beers at the bar and sat at a table , the waitress said she has to collect the cover in cash.  I explained we were told differently at the door.  Didn't matter,  we had to pay in cash.  We had no more Canadian cash and didn't want to exchange for more just to pay a cover.  And they are the only place in Montreal that I went that week that didn't take US dollars.  We finished our beer over the first and only \""song\"" we heard, and left.  $8 for a tap beer BTW is a bit expensive.  Felt like we were being fleeced from the moment we walked in."
4,"This is a new favorite place! The bf and I came here last night with my little brother and sister at the coaxing of my little brother for some bomb a** Mexican food. And boy was he right. \n\nUpon pulling up and seeing the parking lot was packed I got a little worried we would have to wait for a table but...NOPE. We were happily greeted by two pretty hostesses and taken to our table for 4. Our server arrived promptly, took our drink order, and even gave us a little free cup of their homemade guacamole (delicious!!!) after our chips and salsa arrived. It seemed we had multiple people waiting on us and making sure our drinks & chips were full. I appreciated that, a lot. Pretty cool that they were all having each others backs and truly their focus was on the guests dining experience. \n\nWe ordered different varieties of the usual Mexican flare so I won't go into details describing it all. Everything was delicious and we were all happy with our food. \n\nOne thing that I thought was pretty awesome and makes me want to go back for my birthday....they had a few people with birthdays while we were there. They make a HUGE spectacle with singing to you, complete with a sombrero and a free shot of tequila down the hatch!  Oh my gosh it was sooooo loud but ya know I didn't mind it, even though it wasn't for anyone at our table it was still fun to watch and even other guests joined in on singing the happy birthday. Pretty awesome!!! \n\nWill definitely be back here :)"
3,"Fantastic, professional groomers located in South End.  Ron and his experienced staff go above and beyond to get your fur baby looking their very best.  A bit pricey, perhaps, but worth every dime.  If your dog's breed requires a specific cut, this is the place to go.  Ron even donates his services to pups at the nearby Humane Society who need a 'special cut' in order to find a forever home!"
4,"My friend and I had a wonderful lunch and dessert at Divine Pies.  The owner is friendly and was gracious enough to eat at one of her tabes.  (Divine Pies is a take-out only establishment.)  The chicken pot pie was AMAZING with a crust that was flaky and flavorful.  Then came a yummy coconut cream pie that was not overly sweet like other cream pies can be.  This place is well worth the trip to an 'interesting' part of town.  If you're in Charlotte, make a trip to Divine Pies.  You won't regret it."
0,"Very dissapointed.  Heard a lot about this place and went there on an appetite, only to be very dissapointed.  By far the thinnest pizza I've ever seen.  I don't even think they provide toppings for their pizza.  Most of the pizza was just sauce with a little bit of cheese.  Quality wasn't even that good.  I don't know maybe this just isn't my type of pizza because it is definetely a style of its own.  \n\nAll the other reviews are good so maybe I am just used to traditional American pizza places, but I am glad I did not bring someone from out of town here with me because I would have been embarassed.\n\nI easily ate the entire Marghertta pizza on my own $15.  When I pay that much I expect to have leftovers.  I would definetely recommend Oregano's, Barros, or Little Chicago's pizza over this place."
2,"The rating should be $$$ for prices.\n\nWent there because I get eblasts from Raku (Chef Owner Mitsuo Endo) and recommended his fellow carpenter friends' place: Cafe de Japon. It just opened so when we were there, there was a small crowd and at one point my family were the only customers. \n\nOK, the Hamberg Japanese style was tasty, I especially enjoyed it. Had two patties, potatoes and carrots. Good flavor, with daikon, so every bite seemed to make you more hungry if that makes sense. It doesn't come with rice, so that was $3 extra for a small dish (yea it came in a dish, not a bowl...very weird...and the fact that rice is extra, wow). This was $13 so my meal was $16. Wait...there's more...I also got the yuzu juice (citrus fruit) which was good but was $5. It came is a medium sized glass with lots of ice and on the bottom of the menu, it reads, no refills except for iced tea. Two sips and my drink was half full...crazy. That's $21 then.\n\nMy family had the Hamberg demiglaze with egg (a special it was okay at $13), the Hayashi rice (beef stew like, it was good $9), and my wife had the curry (at $9 I think). The curry was disappointing...the spice was great but something about it didn't taste right...maybe we're just used to Curry House's (L.A.) flavor, or even Ichiza's? It just seemed muddled. We also got the crab pasta croquette which came with two pieces of shrimp (nothing to write home about, just fried food). \n\nFor desert, we had the chocolate strawberry parfait ($8) and the coffee jello (can't remember, about $5-6) and then wanted to try the siphon coffee ($5). The deserts weren't special enough to really ask for those prices. Ichiza serves more unique Japanese deserts like their honey toast and that's worth it. As for the coffee? It was very good. We thought that they were going to bring the siphon over to the table and make it there but they just plopped over a cup...think they could've gained more points with presentation if they did that. UCC Coffee in L.A. comes to mind, tasted like it was blue mountain beans. \n\nSo. Was it worth it? The food was good but IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE for what it was. Our bill was $97. I know we ordered a lot but that should've been about half the cost. Touting as a cafe, which is suppose to be casual, the prices are really meant for higher end Japanese joints. For example, like Raku. I can only imagine the owners of Japon were highly influenced by Raku's owner, since they are friends, but they are not in the same caliber. I'm not saying the food isn't good, but to ask for these prices at what's offered? I would rather go to Ichiza on Spring Mountain or Kyara at Jones. \n\nIt's too bad, I'd go often for the coffee if it wasn't so expensive. To be fair, they are new so maybe they're just testing out their structure still. If you're listening, the prices should be about $2-3 less for each item (this is includes the DRINK MENU!!!). I think more people will flock if that was the case."
1,"I have been to Alice Cooperstown MANY times over the years but it was the most recent experience that made me think back to all those times and wonder why it is I keep coming back? \n\nThe food is bland. I don't know how much simplier I can be. The Big Unit--Bland. The Ryne Sandburger--Bland. French Fries---DOUBLE bland. Onion Rings---Bland. The BBQ dipping dauce for the onion rings--BLAND. There is absolutely NO FLAVOR to this food! Thank God for ketchup and mustard cuz otherwise it would have been your basic hosptial food. And every other time I've gone here, it's been bland bland bland food. Nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food. And the drinks...blah at best. I once ordered a Waborita and had to send it back three because it was so watered down. You'd have to spend a lot of money to get a buzz on at this place because the drinks are very watered down. The beers are crisp and fresh, but the drinks..not so much. \n\nNow if you are looking for ATMOSPHERE, Cooperstown is your place.  The staff all have the Alice Cooper-esque eye-liner which is cool. There is Alice memoribilia covering every inch of every wall in the place. And of course all good theme restaurants have a gift shop.  They have great live bands that come out to play and when there is no band, they have great piped in music too.  \n\nCooperstown is a novel place to take out-of-town guests before a game, but if it's just you and your family, you won't feel empty if you skip it.  It's just too much money to spend on very bland, uneventful food."
2,It will be interesting to see how these do after they are open for a while... some stores were only there for the holiday season.... decent selection but could be better... no food choose either..
4,Dr Lobato and his staff get a solid five star from this satisfied customer. In pain and in need I found myself in his office and received excellent care. Gentle expertise was in full effect. Don't know what the rest of you are used to from your dental pros but this was a pleasant surprise for me. Excellent dentist and demeanor.
3,"I like this place however do not get this cajun chicken pasta, they need to take it off the menu."
0,The rooms are nice but the customer service is horrible. We were supposed to get a 2 bedroom but they only gave us a one bedroom and there wasn't anything we could do about it. When we got to the room it was a mess! We were tired and just wanted to sleep and then we have to deal with getting another room which was much farther from our friends room. I wish they had better customer service and management. Definitely would've got a 4 or 5 star if they did
0,"I really wanted to give this place a chance, because I LOVE pho and the reviews here were slightly better than the place down the street. But based on my experience there, I have to give it the lowest rating.\n\nThere's construction going on so you have to go into a side entrance - which isn't a big deal, however there's no clear marker where you're supposed to go to wait to get seated. There were only 3 people working on a Sunday lunch hour, each understandably busy with their own thing, so it was confusing who would be seating us. When our number was taken, we waited for a while - not because there weren't any tables - just that the tables that were open hadn't been cleared. The guy who told us it'd be a few minutes realized no one was cleaning the table, so after a while he went and did it himself. When we sat, we took about 5-10 minutes to go through the menu, but it took another 10 before (maybe longer, I'm trying really hard here not to exaggerate, but it felt like a long time) someone took our order. And I don't know how long it was before we got our spring and summer rolls. There were 4 of us, and a table of 2 who got seated wayyy after us got their appetizers/pho way before we did.\n\nHere's the thing - I am usually understanding when a place is busy and understaffed. The guy who sat us was really nice and apologetic. In fact, I'd say all the staff were really friendly. But the place was not clean (I love hole-in-the-walls, but this place was seemed unsanitary) and the staff were negligent. As for the food - it was ok. Nothing that stood out enough for me to want to deal with that kind of service again. I definitely won't be coming back."
2,"Well, went back and tried two others rolls - Headland roll which is tuna and avocado, and spider roll which is fried softshell crab, avocado, cucumber, and unagi sauce - I had it without the spicy sauce. It was supposed to have tobiko on it too but I didn't see any so being it's flying fish eggs they must have flown away.  Or they thought I didn't know what tobiko was and wouldn't miss it.  Or they forgot.  Anyway, both of those items were better than the first ones I had tried.  I would have changed to 4 stars, but when I was done my tab was $20 and thought, geez, it wasn't THAT much food for $20!  So I left it at 3 stars."
3,I stopped in in May when I was going to buy spices down the street.  Haven't been to an Islands in a while.  Had a very good blue cheese burger.  The service was good.  I got there right after opening time so the place was almost empty to start and only got about 1/3 full by the time I left.
4,This is what I love about Yelp. I discovered ATL Wings while looking for a new lunch spot for myself and a coworker and ran across this high ranking wing joint. Pictures looked good and based on the reviews we got the Honey Habanero and Parmesan Garlic wings with some onion rings and I had to get the grape Kool-aid. Holy crap! Those were some of the best wings that I have ever had.\n\nHoney Habanero: the sweet honey taste hits ya right away and then a little heat comes in. I was expecting a little more heat but the flavor is so great that is doesn't matter. These a sticky wet finger licking wings.\n\nParmesan Garlic: the parmesan flavor is intense at first then the garlic kicks in and the two flavors go perfectly together. These are dry wings which went perfect with the saucy honey habanero. \n\nThe wings are big and meaty and everything a perfect wing should be. I can't wait to go here again and try the catfish.
3,"Tuesday, 39 dollar shots. Love it!"
4,1st time. Brought in by Yelp. Was not disappointed. Cheese sticks were great and the crust was perfect.
4,"This park had a role in why I chose this area to buy a house.  I love hiking, being outdoors,  and getting excercise while I'm at it.  There are several hikes here, which none are to difficult, but not to easy at the same time.  The hikes are not nearly as busy as Sqaw Peak or Camleback so parking or bumping shoulders with anyone is never an issue.  This recreation area is truely a gem for the Arrowhead area of Glendale.   I will be here at least twice a week while the temps remain under 100 in the valley."
2,"Overall I enjoy Auld Dubliner. We've ate her a handful of times. Usually I eat the fish & chips which never fails to disappoint. Last time I ate corned beef tacos, it was a different twist on tacos. But, worth the difference! I enjoyed the meal. Just wished it didn't have so much lettuce. I gave this restaurant three stars because I believe it should have more Irish food options mostly cafe food. Service was good and at night they have an enjoyable fun live band."
0,"OK, I know this chain is very popular but I gotta say I don't get it. The burgers are so generic and the fries look and taste like they are three days old.  I have been to several In N Out Burgers throughout Arizona and California so I know I have given them more than their fair shake at impressing me. One credit I can give them they are consistently disappointing."
4,"10.14.10\n\nThis place is amazing!  If you can venture off the strip and try this place, please do so!\n\nKiki's Burger:\nTwo types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, with garlic aioli on the side.  Um, are you hungry yet?"
0,"Maybe I'm spoiled.  At the Philadelphia Airport, the shops aren't allowed to charge more because you're at the airport.  They don't have that law in Las Vegas.  Hudson News actually charges $5 for a bottle of water.  And of course I paid it because one isn't allowed to bring liquids through security.  I know Las Vegas is all about ripping off tourists, but this might take the cake as the biggest rip off in town."
4,"Best Breakfast and Bang for Your Buck\n\nWell there is no way that this joint is not 5 Stars. I've been here once and I don't care I feel confident with my assessment. Friendly service, huge portions, and very wallet/Purse friendly. I'm not going to long winded with this review because this is simple folks. pancakes bigger than my hand see my pic. Some of the best home made  cornbeef hash I had and the price is crazy cheap. More beef than hash for sure. A meal like this at home in Ft. Lauderdale with the portion served to me would cost at least 18 to 20 bucks. Easy. Here with coffee $12.25. The buttermilk pancake was nice and fluffy and I just put syrup on it and no butter and it was excellent. \n\nAmbiance.\n\nNo nonsense mom and pop old style joint goes to college.   That about sums it up.\n\nVerdict\n\nYou should already be walking, biking, running, taking a cab, a bus or driving here before you finish reading my review. LOL.  Stay Hungry!"
1,"Sign this was going to be my first and only trip to Mon Ami: Having made reservations far in advance for our party of 8, the hostess refused to seat us because one single member of our party was missing in the restroom. So, rather than sit and begin to order appetizers, we were relegated to the \""time out\"" corner until our bladder-busting buddy could join us. Sure, it was crowded, but not packed, and it appeared that we were one of the few groups who either a) made reservations or b) dressed as if we were going to a nice dinner and not an auto auction.\n\nEach of my friends ordered versions of the filet, some with a peppercorn sauce and others without. I went different with a hamburger (having eaten prior and also intrigued at what France would do to one of my favorite American inventions). I asked the burger be cooked \""medium\"" and what I got was a blood-red mess that needed to be sent back. The meals are all served with traditional steak fries, which to me tasted like fried bits of batter and were too much like broken potato chips to eat with your fingers or a fork. Either way, it was a pretty unsatisfying meal for the $13 bucks it cost. I can't speak for the rest of the group who thoroughly enjoyed their meals. However, they had been drinking various mixed drinks for hours previous so they could have eaten fried roadkill cooked in a used gym sock and would have probably savored it with no complaints.\n\nThe only positive about the place was Frangria (which I imagine implies France's take on the traditional Spanish concoction). I now believe that it was called such based on the fact that it was Franzia boxed wine and fruit. either way, it was served in a large, chilled pitcher with delicious fruit and packed a pretty mean buzz between two adults. Definitely worth a try with dinner."
2,"This is my go to 24 Hour Fitness in Las Vegas. All the equipment is clean and it is usually pretty empty so I can get on any machine I want.\n\nThe reason for the three stars is the staff, the 2 hour time limit, the lack of classes offered, and being closed on Sundays. They removed the one class I would have gone to which is yoga on Tuesday nights. Additionally, the staff does not keep the bathrooms well stocked and when you tell them they have an attitude about it.\n\nIt's also NBA playoffs and they never have the games on their many TV's. Every time I come in and ask for the games to be turned on they look at me like why would you wanna watch that. I am your customer just do things with a semi positive attitude."
0,"Customer service is horrible! There are many employees standing in groups but don't offer to help. They are also unknowledgeable about the merchandise they sell. The person that got my shoes couldn't answer my questions. And that was after waiting forever for a person to \""help\"" me. I would not recommending going here. I would put no stars if that was an option"
2,"I've always gotten very good hair cuts at the Ulta salon and most recently I got some ombre coloring done, which I loved.  the only thing is I've had hit and miss experiences with the service.  for example, one time I showed up on Sunday morning and sat and waited for 30 min and eventually I was informed that my hair stylist just did not show up for work that day and they could not contact him.  not cool.  another time, I had the last appointment of the day and my hair stylist was running late from finishing up with another client so I felt like she rushed through my haircut (she didn't even wet my hair -- to save time) and it didn't turn out quite as good as a traditional wet hair cut would have been.  plus, I was still charged for the haircut + blowout, when obviously I didn't get the blowout because my hair was never even wet.\n\nI guess the best bet is to find a dependable stylist you like there, and only schedule appts with them. and try to keep the appts for earlier in the day because you don't want to be the last appt when they are rushing to close up the salon!"
1,"I went to Stacy's for the first time after seeing it on food network, where it was called the #4 best bbq in the country, so my hopes were high, but it didn't quite measure up. I got the pulled pork sandwich and fried okra. The portions were good, but the pulled pork was kind dry and a little tough, and the okra's flour mix didn't seem to be very well seasoned, like it was just flour. Over-all it was ok, don't think I'm going to rush back though. I wish Bigfoot Bbq in Flagstaff had a location here in Phoenix."
2,"The \""Gourmet\"" hot dogs are horrible!  I wish they just had the regular theatre dogs. The bread is huge and dry falling apart in every bite.  HOWEVER, the draft beer is a welcome addition to a movie theatre menu :-) , the screen is small but good enough for a drama or similar movie,  the seats are ok,  yes they recline and are far from each other therefore you don't have to fight for elbow room or accidentally kick the seat in front of you...  but I did find the seats tiring after about an hour."
0,"The animals were cute and the show was good when the animal appeared... which was all of 5 minutes out of an hour show. I do like how he uses animals from shelters and how he promotes that... but his show deserves 1 star.....\n\nThey advertise it as a pet show, but really it's just a bunch of random acts put together. Acts you can see at circus circus for FREE. He even has his daughter in this show doing some kind of showgirl dance and some hula-hooping (no animal appearance whatsoever) then he has some kind of quick clothes changing act (again no animal appearance). And then he just juggles the rest of the time. \n\nHonestly, the animal only appear for a total of 5 minutes! This is a waste of time. I regret watching this. \n\nThe theater/staff is pretty unorganized as well. They told us that the doors open at 3pm for general seating (since there is no assign seating unless you are VIP) but they didn't open until 3:45 and they still started the show at 4pm when everyone was still trying to get to their seats. \n\nAlso I cannot stress this enough! THE COCKTAIL WAITRESS needs to learn some common sense! Throughout the whole show she would walk back and forth in the VIP area (which is right in front of the stage) and block the stage. So when the animals actually do come out YOU CAN'T SEE THEM. This really ticked me off because I wanted to see the animals! And most of the animals are small enough to be completely blocked by the waitress.\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ANYONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE."
2,"Sorry Wicked Spoon you got downgraded in stars due to your buffet closing at 3pm, yet you still seat people at 2:15pm. We arrived later in the afternoon, come on... it's vegas, people wake up late and go for a brunch. Anyways we get in there around 2:15 and here we are trying to scramble to get some food and it's very overcrowded and you guys stop refilling the food around 3pm... it was kind of a bust. The food is unique but it's wasn't all that."
1,"The Bay Area has everything a food lover could want, except for high quality buffets. That's why I always go to the buffets when I'm in Vegas. I'd been to Mandalay's buffet a number of years ago and rated it nearly as good as the Bellagio for quality and variety. Sad to say, the Mandalay Bay buffet was a huge disappointment this week. Black fungus on the stone crab claws, frozen, overcooked to mush vegetables, glutenous fried rice in the Chinese food section, roast chicken quarters that looked dry, the same sparse pieces baking away all night under the heat lamp, butterflied, deep fried prawns with mushy interior, cantaloupe and watermelon on the verge of crossing over to the bad side, chicken cordon bleu that was less flavorful than I can imagine coming from any brand in the Safeway frozen food aisle. Seems like the Mandalay Bay resort has given up on this restaurant. I will not go back."
4,"This is a great upscale consingment shop with reasonable prices, beautiful clothing and accessories! The shop is clean, clothes are beautifully displayed, easy to navigate and full of treasures. The owner is friendly and welcoming.\nI highly recommend this shop! Love it"
0,Stayed here with a friend for a few nights just passing through. I managed to forget my laptop charger in the room. It is an Apple laptop charger which run about $80 per. I immediately called as soon as I realized and was on the road an hour away. So i asked that I could please be charged to mail it to California. The first girl I spoke to laughed at me on the phone but did say she found it. I had 3 different people tell me they had it in their hands. I gave all my info and everything and now they said it was never found. Call me paranoid but it sounds like somebody got themselves a brand new charger.
3,"First off, download the app: Epoxy so you can get an e-stamp card ;). If you come often enough, why not?\n\nThey've got desserts, tea, coffee, and stuff like that.\n\nThe place isn't exactly spacious so bring a friend or two but a group is ill-advised. Especially if you're just chilling and playing cards or something. Bring that to Fresh Cup or Icy Juicy or something.\n\nOtherwise, it's a pretty chill place to be at with a few friends. They've also got outside seating so it'll be a bit more roomy once the weather gets warmer. The tea gets you free refills. My favorite is Fiji, hands down, and nothing else has really stood out to me.\n\nVery Berry Waffle - I approve. Haven't tried the Maple Story or the toast but they're definitely up on my list soon enough."
0,Horrible experience!!!!  I am not at all satisfied with service they provided.the girl who did manicure to me was very rude and rushing things .When I complained abt her  they sent different person but He was also not so friendly and did not do good job .I would never go back there.....Overall Service is horrible WSATE OF MONEY..
3,"Another good Tutti Santi in my neighborhood.!   Food is quite good and the wine by the glass has some exceptional treats.   Staff is friendly, available and happy to help.    Too bad Amarone declined and died here but Tutti Santi is a welcome addition!!!!!"
4,"Went here last night for my fathers 60th birthday, by his request. He suggested this place because he said he went there before, he said \""I had a fish dish, it was really good for the price...\n\nI loved it. 1st of all its the best view imaginable, the food was delicious and the service was better than expected - fast, and friendly. \n\n the birthday song they sing is amazing!!! I will be back."
1,worst drive thru design ever
4,"Elenir is the BEST in town!! I have lived here my entire life and has been getting treatments for about 6 years at different spas but will never go anywhere else again. On a personal note Elenir is one of the nicest and most patient people I have ever met. She even gave me some free tips on the best kind of skin care products to use at home, not even trying to sell me crap I don't need, just making great suggestions based on her years in the industry. Very much appreciated when everyone else in town just wants to squeeze money out of you."
4,"The best food in Vegas. I moved here from NYC with tons of Vegetarian restaurants and this stacks right up. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and the inside is spartan, but me and my roomate were floored at how good everything is. We had the garlic eggplant fake chicken and the pepper beef. I've had so many mediocre meals at fancy vegas restaurants, the real gems are places like this. The prices can't be beat either, $10 max for an entree."
0,"I must say first, very quick and friendly service.  The problem with this pizza joint, is the pizza.  It was a thicker dough stingy amount of sauce and the small amount of cheese was burnt making it a hard plastic layer that covered the pizza.  I wish I could keep supporting them but just a lousy product."
1,"I just checked in for a conference next door @ the Aria. I chose to stay at the Vdara since it was a non-gaming hotel. Actually the hotel is beautiful....staying up on the 45th floor. When traveling, I require reasonable Internet performance allowing me to accomplish my work through different unified  communications modes (e.g. Skype, Cisco Jabber, Virtual Desktop, etc...) When I checked in, I paid a $20-25 per day use fee for certain amenities to include WiFi or direct connection. When I logged in, to call home via Skype, my connection was pixelated and choppy and it finally locked up. I was having flashbacks to the old dial-up days. I complained to the front desk and they referred me to Internet support. They also discounted my first day for the trouble. I am here for a week....in work mode. I called the Internet support folks and they had me run Speedtest.net to get a measurement. It was rated as a letter grade of \""F\"" comparing to other hotels in the area. The technician advised that this speed was normal and was not surprised. I am now told if I pay and \""additional fee\"", they can give me faster service. I am very surprised at all this. We are in the middle of the year of 2013. Wow... \n\nSee URL below:\n\nhttp://www.speedtest.net/result/2701696789.png\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nDining experience in the Vdara \""Market Cafe\"" quickly went awry when my wife and daughter ate breakfast on 16 May 2013. This horrible customer experience was caused by what appeared to be a mop string embedded in my daughter's eggs. It seemed to take an eternity to resolve by staff with my wife's and daughter's insistence that this was not normal. They were given a $50.00 gift certificate to buy more Vdara \""FOOD\"" and a bowl (about the size of a dessert dish) of fruit I wouldn't give to a monkey. As \""consolation\"", the food service manager told us the string was actually used to tie off sausage......whatever... See pictures @ http://www.flickr.com/photos/hdryder/sets/72157634025082695/"
0,Disgusting! Went through the drive-thru and grabbed a quick lunch. Without looking I start eating my burger...hmm tastes a little salty. I finally glance at the burger and notice that it is completely raw. I threw it out immediately and will not be going back.
0,"My daughter went for an oil change, 2004 Chevy Trailblazer, charged her $41.00 for a $15.00 job.  Then proceeded to tell her that the serpentine belt was so bad she shouldn't drive more than 10 miles on it.  They would gladly change it for her for $100.  I got a Dayco belt at Autozone and changed it in five minutes at a cost of $35.  They were looking at up to more than $65 for labor. (that calculates to $780 an hour for labor) and you know they get Jobber price on the belt so pay less than I did."
0,Food was decent.  Don't expect service.  Got a huge frown and attitude when I had the audacity to ask the server to bring me chop sticks.   She brought me a spoon to eat my meal with and nothing else. What?
3,"All good, they don't make dumplins like me though!,"
3,"I came to Yellowtail, trying to continue the legacy of great sushi meals I have had in Vegas. I managed to do so, but I will say that we ended up ordering more \""non-sushi\"" items than we had intended here, and that was fine.\n\nFrom their hot and cold plates menu, we ended up with four things. Our Bigeye Tuna pizza came recommended, and was quite good. The tasty thin sliced tuna was \""glued\"" to flat bread with something - creamy, and neutral, maybe a creamy cheese? That particular ingredient wasn't listed on the menu. The whole thing was topped with drizzled truffle oil, which I frankly could have done without. The more I am exposed to truffle, the more I think the smell is offensive. It's too powerfully earthy, almost a rotting smell, to me at least, and while the taste is not as strong as the smell, it tends to overwhelm my nose, and thus my sense of taste. But this was still good, my anti-truffle campaign aside. The sliced octopus in jalapeno vinaigrette was...fine, but unremarkable. The octopus was tasty, but the vinaigrette needed some more punch. I didn't find much jalapeno in it.\n\nFrom the hot side of the menu, our tempura king crab was awesome - light batter, flavorful tender crab meat, tossed in a sweet/hot sauce. So delicious, and probably the highlight of the prepared plates. The seafood dynamite was also good, served in a cast pan with corn and mushrooms. Kind of an interesting take, with plenty of chunked seafood. Also worth ordering.\n\nFor sushi, we ended up with their popping spicy crab roll - how can you resist a sushi roll with pop rocks? This is gimmicky, but also very good. I liked the crunch of the pop rocks (and the pop) along with the soft crab and crisp cucumber. Their spicy tuna roll was good - heavy on tuna, not just spicy mayo like I've had at some places. And the toro scallion roll had some of the best toro I've had to date. Super tender and flavorful. The scallions did not overpower like I thought they might.\n\nI also had my standard seaweed salad, which here is a mix of fresh and pickled seaweed, for a nice change of pace. Really enjoyable.\n\nService was good, prices are...well, I'd say normal, but not absurd for Vegas. The restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountain, so if you get a good table, you've got a great view. Even from the middle of the room, we found ourselves stopping conversation to watch the thing go off. Cliched though it may be, it's still really cool, every time I see it.\n\nHere's to another successful sushi meal in Vegas - 3 for 3. Of note, dress code here is \""casual\"" for sure. One of us saw a man enter the bar wearing a bear costume (which included fake abs and a furry hat with bear ears) underneath a suit. So yeah. Wear those sneakers without fear."
0,"Great music, the ambiance was sexy, mysterious and energetic.  I was having a great time until I left my private area and proceeded to go to the restroom.  I asked security where the mens rooms were located.  The gentlemen asked me for my ID and requested I follow him.  We exited the club to the casino level where he informed me that I was being asked to leave because it was brought to their attention that I was seeking the purchase  of drugs from the waitress...a COMPLETE UTTER LIE and FABRICATION.  I thought he was joking unit a few other security guards approached.  I asked if I could go back and get my husband but was denied.  I spent 20 minuets attempting to call him in a very loud club at 3:00 AM.  Eventually my husband answered his phone and found me.\n\nThis was a very humiliating, embarrassing experience.  I support their zero drug policy, however make sure you GET IT RIGHT!"
2,Stayed here on our trip and it was alright considering we got the deal for dirt cheap. We got there and were upgraded to the towers (thank god) I hear the pyramid rooms are old and smell like stale cheese and cigarette smoke. Would I stay here again...maybe. Overall the experience was okay. The buffet sucked but the only saving grace was ordering room service and having breakfast in bed. (back to bed Bambi it is still daylight)
3,Tempura Shrimp bowl is awesome. I like the fried rice too. It's a bit pricey here.
0,Went on a Sunday night after coming from Lavo.  They played house music.  We walked in and walked right back out.  Totally lost our buzz.
4,"This is an awesome club!  If you have a group (we had 7 guys for a birthday party weekend) get a table and bottle service.  Tao's VIP service team is the best in the city.  We got a table up at the Tao Beach pool area with access to the regular club as well.  Our two waitresses were total sweethearts and everybody in the group had a ball.  Things got pretty blurry as the night wore on, but that will happen when you order 4 bottles of Goose (that's Geese)......"
4,"OMG! Everything we ordered was delicious!! Lobster tail, creme puff, chocolate mousse cake (incredibly elegant & beautiful) & an Oreo type pastry. It was allll wonderful. We enjoyed sitting at the counter watching pastries being made & decorated too! It was very crowded but customers were served quickly. I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas & Carlo's Bakery!!"
3,"Wow... I was a skeptic, but now I'm a devotee. A coworker was always going here for lunch and inviting me, but I was sure that a blended bowl of fruit, veggies, grains and various ingredients wouldn't satisfy me til dinner. I was wrong!  I've had the peanut butter and the chocolate coconut a couple times and I am hooked.  There are a couple others that I look forward to trying in the coming months.  Definitely give it a try if you're in the area.  Sign up for their text message alerts for deals too!"
3,"This is quite simply the easiest Chrome Hearts location to find in the world.  For starters, they have a sign outside of their location in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  It doesn't get much simpler than that.  Try finding the one in Hollywood, by contrast, and you will understand what I am talking about.\n\nAs for the selection, this store is quite large and keeps a good stock of products.  I am not so much a fan of the clothing, but I am all about the eyewear and this store has great inventory.  I have not seen this many styles in one place, including boutique optical shops and other CH locations.  Jennifer was especially helpful."
2,"Las Vegas! If i was forced to stay at a \""motel\"" i'll still go to vegas! seriously? Come'N don't u agree? lol ok fine maybe motel is a bit too harsh (: you get the point people. \n\nEnCore and its RED dragons and flying fish in the sky sure pulls your attention, their sky high level rooms and its beautiful full glass views will make you speech less. As in this is too much red, i mean if you are color blind this place would put you in a serious trouble. Stayed here for two nights and three days. Not with the wife though it was with few friends. We didn't really so much \""enjoy\"" the stay as it was described in TV, and ads! lets just say i've had many other better experience before. \n\nThat being said, food, services and cigar selection downstairs is worth it. sadly it was winter so didn't enjoy the outdoor poor and cocktails. Not sure i do go back there again. Wait wait, if i was offered free promotion deals too good to be true I just might take it! hahah (:  \n\nMaybe this review seem \""negative\"" due to the lose i had on their casino yea! pretty bad two nights. Who knows if I won that night I just might of been interested and had a bit more positive approach as an overall rating. \n\nover all C+ aah-okay!"
0,"So, the MGM Grand hotel is not a great please to stay if you are on business. When I first got to the MGM Gand, the check in line was a 45 minute just to get to the counter. The staff wasn't to friendly but I guess after dealing with thousands of people, who would want to smile. \n\nSo the rest of the week was ok but until Thursday, I ordered room service and I was quoted 35 minutes. After one hour of waiting, I call back down to room service and asked if my order was on its way. The host told me the it would be another hour. And he wasn't sure why the first person I talked to quoted me 35 minutes. So I cancel the order. 15 minutes later the room service attendant shows up with the order. I sent him away. It seemed that room service department didn't care at all.\n\nSo at this point I was very hungry and we went down stair to one of the many restaurants and half of them were closed or the didn't have everything on the menu. And one drink was $15.00. Wow, talk about a mark up.  We finally found a place that was open and the service was ok but the food was bad. The chicken wasn't cooked all the way through and the eggs looked like they have been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The hotel doesn't even let you do a late check out. This place  will never be in my future plan to stay at if a ever plan to come back to Las Vegas."
4,Good Service. Good Beer. Good Food.
3,"I had heard from others this place was not as good as the hype but to go for the experience.  We don't have In-N-Out Burger here on the east coast, so when in Las Vegas, we figured we had to go.  There is no good way to get there if you are on the strip.  Even though it is down the street from the strip, you pretty much have to take a cab.  Sadly the cab ride is more expensive then the food itself.  But I guess that is part of the experience.  When we got there the line was literally out the door.  This scared us, but the line did move pretty fast.  My husband ordered the double double animal style, I ordered the cheeseburger meal with fries and a drink.  I did not get animal style as I wasn't sure if I would like the sauce or not.  I should have gotten cheese fries, but I didn't.  While my husband was waiting to get our order, I searched and searched for a seat.  Finally I was able to grab a seat in the corner.  \n\nWhen my husband brought our food to the table, it looked good.  I am glad I got the cheeseburger and not the double double, as it was just enough for me.  The bun was fresh and soft and slightly warm, the burger was extremely juicy, and the special sauce complimented the burger nicely.  The burger also had a good amount of lettuce and tomatoes on it.  The abundance of fries was just right.  My husband's double double animal style was double meat, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles.   He too was very pleased with this meal.  In-N-Out is known for all fresh ingredients, never frozen.  I have to say I enjoyed it and thought it was much better than a five guys.  Since everyone is pretty much taking a cab to get to In-N-Out, it is pretty easy to get a cab back.  I wish they had In-N-Out burger here on the east coast!"
0,"You would think that the huge line to get into the place would indicate this is the hottest coffeeshop on the strip.  However, the line is a vegas illusion and this restaurant shouldn't even be welcomed at the circus circus in Reno let alone the Aria which is beautiful.  We went at 8am so they should have been ready to rock for breakfast but they didn't even have their instruments out.\n\nThere was nobody in the restaurant so the line was BS.  The service could be compared to Denny's at 3 in the morning.  The eggs were runny, the coffee was swill, the waffle was plain and had zero wow factor.  With so many options in vegas please do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere so they put in a better food option in this spot."
2,"Went back to Cacao 70 this past weekend and was really hoping that they made the leap to homemade marshmallows. Sadly, not :( I was particularly disappointed for two reasons, one because they told me the first time I visited that they were going to be switching to homemade, and second because they were making a big deal about their s'mores. \n\nI still like the place, don't get me wrong, but I really think that marshmallows are just too easy to not make from scratch, especially for s'mores."
2,"Ru San's tends to be our go-to for a last minute meal plan.  The quality of the sushi, while not the best in town, is always solid and doesn't kill your wallet.  I'm always a sucker for the Sinking Titanic Hidden Treasure roll because there is always the chance that the bowl may contain the token that represents a $10 gift card.  I've yet to ever discover the hidden treasure, but I keep on trying. \n\nAlong with the $1 menu, the lunch buffet seems to be the draw for most people.  I've only tried the buffet here once and doubt that I'll rush back again.  The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.  So let it be written, so let it be done.  \n\nIf you want sushi that is of consistent quality at a decent price, Ru San's is for you.  If you want a quiet date, it is not.  There is a lot of yelling.  Kind of like Moe's--but Japanese."
3,"I'm giving Camping World in Avondale, Az  off of 99 Ave n I-10 heading  to   LA  Debbie n Hal her Husband plus  Liza in Financing were very easy to work with they treated my wife n myself as people not just another sale I had been turned down for the $100,000.00 loan they didn't give up they found bank that works with veterans after 5 denial the USAA BANK said yes we will work with the dealership n the Veteran to get  his RV. Before camping world we had tried 3 other dealerships n got no where Camping World did not give up on us. If u r a US VETERAN n want to get ur RV no matter what size or class give Camping World a chance my wife did the shopping around I had to sign the paperwork which again was mind busting paperwork is a drag Again Camping World is #1 with us so far"
3,Good prices and helpful staff. I have been using this store for most of my art supplies the last several years.
4,Crowded but worth the hour long wait for breakfast. My favorite was the cheese grits (which they offer as a substitute for breakfast potatoes). The red chile sauce was also a favorite. \n\nThe ambiance is loud and crowded but I am willing to overlook for their great food.
3,"I'm surprised by the prior low star reviews also. In terms of chain delivery pizza  places this cant be beat in Phoenix. \n\nI rate this pizza above Pizza Hut/Dominoes/Little Caesars\nEqual to Streets of New York, NYPD Pizza,  and maybe Pappa Johns\nBelow Spiano's (if you have them near you)"
4,"Best sushi in town!  It is so nice to see that although the location has changed, this family owned restaurant has maintained all the wonderful qualities of the former Scottsdale location.   Our usual favorites Albacore Tuna shashimi and Keita roll are still extremely fresh and tasty.  The crispy calamari is delicious now made with a lighter rice flour batter.  The ambiance of the new Tempe location is fun and trendy and accessible from everywhere.  Robert and Risa are always the perfects hosts and go out of their way to make everyone feel welcome.  We arrived early for happy hour specials and the place was filling up quickly by the time we left.  Highly recommend!!"
1,"Yeah,I'm going to have to agree with everyone that this place is all hype...only good thing was that I didn't have to wait in line..the first time I tried it was more than an hour wait so I left..."
4,"We visited due to its proximity. Wow! Great, convenient, local Mexican food. You know it's good if the local fire station is at the table next to you enjoying their food."
2,"The food was good but the service was lousy. Our waitress definitely had an attitude. Although I have some dietary issues, no changes were allowed to the menu. It took several passes with the waitress so I could choose something that would not instigate a health issue. Atmosphere is nice, but if you don't have reservations you are seated by the kitchen. Worth visiting, but don't dare question the chef's palate."
0,"I was somewhat excited when the store says \""Made famous in Venice Beach.\"" I was hoping for a Nathan's kind of hot dog, but I was dead wrong... I know that airport food isn't usually good, but this place's just horrible. \n\nI got their Hot Italian sausage ($6) - Sausage, some veggies with bell peppers. First off, it's way over priced and the sausage's pretty small. Second, the sausage doesn't even taste all that and it's not grilled right; the outer part isn't even crispy. Lastly, I was still mad hungry... Luckily, their fries ($2.75) weren't bad. The seasoning isn't bad, however, it's mad greasy. The oil literally soaked through to the table... I wouldn't go back here again!"
2,"So, the food was very good, not as good as Gordon R. Burger or the Burger bar @Mandalay.\nThe interior here is cool and wait stuff is very friendly and helpful. I like it!"
1,"I am a lover of the weiner!... but, this place was all talk and no show.  I have to say that I enjoy the hot dog ladies at USC, Sac downtown, or TJ over Pinks...  Yes. I'd much rather have some Sacramento Capitol Dawg over Pink's... and, (if you know me) that's saying alot..."
4,I've never had better service at a mexican restaurant.  The food is great as well.  Don't skip getting the cheese dip.  It is killer.  Our 9 month old boy knocked over my drink as soon as I got it.  The staff was so friendly with getting it cleaned up and making sure our experience was excellent.  I think that this is now my go to mexican restaurant in University Charlotte.
2,"Was happy to see L&L open in a closed diner location on Buffalo & Lake Mead next to Grape Street.  I stopped by for some take out at 6pm and it was empty.  \n\nService was awkward.  The two cooks at the grill were staring out at me because they had nothing to do.  The lady at the counter was not very friendly.  \n\nI ordered Chicken Katsu Curry, Chicken Cutlet with Gravy, BBQ Mixed Plate, and a side of Lumpia.  \n\nThe food was good...but I was not pleased that they would pour the gravy over the cutlets in a take out order.  I've never had to give special instructions to any restaurant to put the gravy on the side.  The cutlets were soggy when we came home.  :(\n\nI've been to other L&L's and have had much better service.  If this is a franchised location, they need to be trained better.  If this is a corporate owned location, they need to be trained better."
1,"Took her royal highness to the Tap Haus as she wanted to try something new. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and meals as well.  We both thought the food was OK (You need to like German style food or just move along) as was the service and the drinks.\n\nWhat struck me the most was that the food is severely over priced whereas adult beverages were just as much under priced.\n\nI think this is a great building, with good parking (dirt lot ladies so be ready to dust off your heels) but I'm convinced this building is cursed and whomever moves in, is destined to go belly up.\n\nTons of seating but the place never seems to be busy.\n\nTons of large screen TV's but still not so much a sport's bar.\n\nI think the wait staff could use some pointers as they seem a bit confused and less than welcoming .......... Tons of beers to pick from but people around us said the beer was cool but not cold.  Warm beer??  Maybe over seas but not in the USA.\n\nI think we'll go back ...... I think .......... Or maybe not ........  Not loving it, not hating it, give it a try and see for yourself."
1,I've been to better Brazilian restaurants. This one was below my expectations! Waaaaay over priced for the quality.
1,Way too noisy.  Can't hold a conversation with the person next to you.  Food is okay.  Wine is good.
3,"Yummy taquitos!  Great atmosphere, felt like I was in Mexico.  Happy hour is pretty decent.  Would love to come back at night to see how crowded it gets."
4,David is the shit ... Don't listen to any of the bad reviews !!! Incredible show great for adults and children !!! Worth every penny if you got it spend for better seats if not .... Really not a bad seat in the house !!!
3,"This is the only chain I support whole heartedly!  Visited this Scottsdale location last night and received great service and a fresh flavorful salad. I've never been disappointed with Charleston's. The decor is the nice dark cherry wood and the bar has a good happy hour with just enough TVs to catch a game but resist the \""sports bar\"" title. \nLove: baked potato, croissants, ribs, salad and if your indulging-don't miss the bread pudding!"
2,"I run the risk of being labeled a hater with my   review of this little lunch spot but oh well. I haven't felt so out of place since I accompianied my ex girlfriend to her Junior League luncheon. I wasn't totally sure what this place wanted to be, I mean there were a bunch of boomers sitting around getting bombed at two in the afternoon next to a pile of blue hairs munching salads and sandwiches. Is this a place to take Gram when shes in town? Or do I drag my sister here to experience the ambience and the hipster guy that brings your sandwich? Anyway the food was good but they bring way too many plates, one for your dressing, one for your sandwich, one for your salad and an extra one for a tasty little muffin.  If they want four stars they should whittle away the pretention, serve up the good food and dispense with the magenta booths. It clashes with my scarf."
3,"When it comes to domestic car repair in Las Vegas, T&M Automotive is your one stop shop for all things car/truck related. It is a family owned business that is truly customer oriented and willing to go out of their way at any time. One of the techs once told me \""We won't sell you anything you do not need right now because we are busy enough as is.\"" Now how many other mechanics have said that to you before? A few dealers in town will try and up sell you any way they can to make an extra buck but not the folks of T&M! \n\nOn a side note, because they are always so busy, make sure to call ahead to make an appointment when you can. This saves them and you a lot of time when it comes to getting your car fixed and on your way ASAP."
4,"Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere,and healthy menu options make this place a great choice any time of the day."
4,"I have been to all the RA's in the Valley and this one has been the best by far!!! Went with a friend on Friday night for happy hour, had amazing sushi and drink specials and ended up staying way past happy hour was over because we had the BEST waiter ever!! Our Waiter Shad made our experience at RA so much fun and the service he provided has been some of the best I have experienced in the Valley!! If you go to RA, ask for Shad, you won't be disapointed!!!"
1,"Edinburgh has the best Indian and South Asian Food I've ever had (and no, I haven't been to India.) With so many great places nearby, I don't understand the appeal of the Mosque Kitchen. The food is as bland as it is greasy, the service is rude, and everything is a la carte, so even though the curries themselves are a reasonable \u00a33-6, with bread and any sort of side you're looking at something closer to \u00a35-7. For that price you can get an all-you-can-eat meal at one of the several sit-down buffets in the area.\n\nNote: I am a huge fan of sloppy, no-frills curry counters, so ambience is not the issue."
1,"Food was ok.  I was hungry, so I'm probably being generous.\n\nThe place is cool, if you are into Cowboy bars.  This is a fun place to take out of town guests for a drink."
1,": I really wish there were a nursery that could compete w/ their tree selection.  It became apparent after they planted our three fruit trees a few months ago that they'd injured the apple tree w/ a giant pole they drove through the roots (to keep the trunk straight, they said, unlike the apple tree we'd purchased there the previous year and planted ourselves.  Irony?  We'd chosen that apple, and it was curved when we bought it.  Furthermore, they were only supposed to plant the other two trees.  If we'd have planted the new apple, as planned, it wouldn't be struggling to survive, right now).\n\nMore than anything, the experience reminds me to be assertive and complain about terrible service, and to look elsewhere before buying any more trees from these people.\n\n(Edit:  Apple tree died.)"
0,"Stopped in today with my boyfriend and our 6 year old.  I ordered the green chili burro chimi style.  Sour cream and Guac on the side.  As I cut into my burro, it literally deflated.  My curiosity led me to open the chimi, where I found 5 cubed pieces of green chili beef. 5. 5 quarter sized piece of meat in a full size tortilla.  I ordered the burro chimi style cause I like a crispy shell.  This was not the case.  After finishing my 5 with meat bites, I ate mushy tortilla with some semi par green chili sauce, and ONLY because I hadn't eaten all day, and I am pregnant.  And for $7, I couldn't throw it away.  But I will never buy it again.\n\nMy boyfriend and the wee one both had shredded beef tacos. Nothing terrible, pretty decent, I would of rather had the tacos.  He originally wanted a shredded beef burrito, sans beans.  The guy looked at him and rather rudely replied 'well we can do it but the burrito won't be big...'  Seems like a pattern here.  In addition... if you're charging me for a steak burrito, I don't want a bean burrito with some steak in it, I want a steak burrito with some beans in it.  If your informing customers that without the \""filler\"" it won't be much of a burrito... it isn't a good sign.\n\nThey also don't take credit or debit which is a huge pain.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had an ATM, but they don't, so we had to order based on the little cash I had in my wallet.  \n\nWe got my meatless fake chimi, 6 tacos and 1 soda for $21.  The tacos were not that big.  Skip it.  Or drive the block or so extra to Rosita's."
4,"I have been trying different pizza places for the best pizza in town.  I thought Metro was going to be the \""typical\"" pizza but then I tried their Metro.  The metro is a thicker crust with extra cheese.  At first I didn't know how I was going to like it but with extra sauce that pizza was wonderful!  The crust was cooked perfectly, cheese was melted and their sauce was incredible. Their garlic fries are also very good.  I haven't tried fries like these anywhere else.  Make sure you try the Metro next time you order one of their pizzas."
4,What a unique take on burgers!! Asian fusion burgers!  When i came here I got the ronin burger and garlic chili edamame with sweet potatoe fries.  Everything was absolutely delicious. Definitely going to be coming back!
0,no stars! place is disgusting. found a worm/catapillar in the kim chi. didnt give us a refund. gross. dont go there. for any of the food. it's so dirty. so dirty! so rude! so cheap! signs everywhere about extra charges.
2,"First things first, they did a great job printing my sign. Quality was great, they even changed the background color for me just as I had asked. They followed up our emails with a rendering of the final product before printing. This was great.\n\nHowever, there were two issues that caused me to drop their ratings. When I ask a week in advance what day I have to get you the product to have it available for pick up first thing Monday morning and you tell me Thursday. I expect it will be done and ready first thing Monday morning. I got him the graphics with plenty of time just as he had said. Once I got no response as of Friday evening I got concerned. My calls and emails must have just been ignored over the weekend until 8:30am Monday morning when we have someone on the way to hopefully pick up the sign. Finally I get a hold of him to find out the sign will be printed at 10am and ready by 11:30 for pick up. This is by no means first thing in the morning. Could have been a major issue for me, luckily it was just a waste of time and man hours."
2,"Mac n Cheese pizza!!!!!! What else do you want me to write?\n\nThis place is good. Not awesome. I think they get so much attention for the ridiculousness of some of their offerings. I mean, Chicago Dog Pizza? Really? I love me a Chicago Dog and I love me some pizza but I'll keep those two separate. I dont need a sliced up hot dog on my pizza. Great job on the mac n cheese pizza though. Very original and pretty damn tasty. When I wake up from my carb coma, I'll write more......"
4,One of the best places in Vegas I ate at . The drinks were great. the service was awesome!! and my food was amazing! The pizza my husband got was really good and the Organic Chicken was to die for! \n\nany place that serves Maytag blue cheese sauce is going to be a winner far as im concerned! :)
2,"On the way back from checking out a house for sale, the smells wafting in from the pizzerias were overwhelming. We made a U-turn and parked on the street across from this spot. The Mediterranean pasta was good, just like the service. Not life changing, but still good. My friend really fancied the mild wings. We enjoyed some Doctor Oz ironically playing on their flat screen. My dish was big (it turned into 2-3 meals for me) and I was served a nice piece of garlic bread, sliced. They have a good selection of drinks, among the normal ever so mundane pop, Arizona tea, and gatorade.  The reason for 3 stars is because the meal was just okay, but what you would expect from a pizzeria. There weren't any napkins around and my friend (who was munching on saucy wings) had to ask for some mid-meal."
3,"A friend took me here when I was in Phoenix and my first impression was of a Mexican TGI Fridays. It wasn't a bad thing. and since I'm a truck driver ANYTHING but the truckstop fast food would have been good. \n\nWe arrive just as they seat a party of eight, and with no hesitation were greeted by a friendly hostess and taken to a table. The table arrangement was a little cramped for me (but then again I'm just under 6' and a couple tortillas shy of 280) and my buddy is in the same range. After a while it felt cozy enough. \n\nOur waiter, I want to say his name is Ernesto, was quick to present himself and ask if we wanted drinks. Now, I'm a trickdriver and like to play the part, I made  a comment about my Corona with no fruit and take it like a man-straight and he responded with something to the fact that he hasn't quite made it there yet and needed a few more years to season himself to man status. Ok, this guy's got personality I thought. My buddy and I are a bit rambunctious and Ernesto didn't shy away from it. He joined in on our fun. His service was spot-on in my opinion to the point that I mentioned it to my buddy. Ernesto was very attentive to our needs. The beer was half-empty \""another beer?\"" or \""more chips?\"". He even brought all three levels of salsa. \n\nNow on to our food. The menu was simple and efficient, only 4 pages if I remember correctly, and I decided on the chimichangas de Macayo (carnitas). I'm such a sucker for carnitas, I freely admit, but these were top notch. I would go so far as to say better than grandmas back in California. The mol\u00e9 was good, not overpowering, and a great sauce for this plate. The beans and rice were simple and complimenting as they should be. Oh, and the actual chimichanga itself was huge, pushing upwards of 20oz maybe more and my fork was sufficient enough to cut through; no knife needed. The food was also hot all the way through and not just the outer layer. \n\nThe cost was a bit pricey as our bill was $37 and change for two dinners and two beers, but I would say worth the price. The service and food made the 25% tip an easy choice. I'd be happy to goback"
0,"Another quick dissapointment among a overrated franchise that has lost it's steam over the course of a few years. When Lee's sandwiches first opened it's doors in California it was among the best places to go to for Banh Mi, Iced Coffee, and even their deserts. Unfortunately as they expanded their stores their quality slowly diminished. Let's hope that Las Vegas is the last place they go to.\n\nI had the opportunity to go to their grand opening celebration with a couple of other fellow yelpers, but for the benefit of the doubt, I wanted to hold off on writing a review on them since it wouldn't have been fair. They were super busy that day, so I wanted to wait a bit and come back another time since I didn't get to check everything out.\n\nWent there last night and it was a major dissapointment. The Banh Mi still sucked, bearly any meat or paste, if you're gonna give that little then charge less. It's Lees Sandwiches, not freaking Louis Vuitton or Chanel. So please don't charge more just because of the name. And if you're gonna charge more, at least make it taste super delicious so it's worth the price, but it's not. The bread I admit is good, but that's only because it is baked in house fresh everyday, so there is no excuse to mess up on that. Iced coffee, hella expensive for the amount they give you. I piss more after being dehydrated for 8 hours.\n\nOverall the store is very clean and obviously new, very flashy and modern. They have free wifi, YAY! But I wouldn't use it anyway.\n\nCustomer service, oh lord......I asked one of the workers last night if they still only accepted cash, and she pretty much answered me like I was stupid retarded. She then right in front of me turned over to her co-worker and whispered something to him about me asking her such a stupid question, and that there is a sign right there that says \""cash only\"", and he just shook his head. First of all you dumb\nb!tch, if you're gonna talk sh!t right in front of a customer, then you might as well say it out loud and not try to cover your mouth with a freaking receipt. Or if you were smart at least wait till I'm gone and then say something. Fortunately I was in a good mood last night so I didn't say anything to her. So if you're reading this, YES, I heard you, you little twat. So let's rewind the retarded and don't get all pissy about me not seeing your stupid little sign. Out of all the shit and signs they have by the register how the hell am I suppose to see that little \""Cash only\"" sign. That's like being in a night club and trying to find a midget.\n\nSo.............this junk get's one star, make your food better, charge a reasonable price, be smarter about what you say in front of a customer, and for god sakes accept debit/credit cards. We're not in the stone ages, and let's not make the stereotype that asians are cheap/stingy any more true than it already is.\n\nI don't even feel like Rickrolling this place, sigh.........if Rick Astley were here he would just face palm himself."
1,"I would not eat here again.  I could've bought the nachos and salsa at half the price for twice the serving size at the grocery store.  Even the margaritas are not good.  And they served a pint glass. Why?  The tacos look good, but they are flavorless and bland at best. I'm irritated I wasted my money here."
4,"The donuts and muffins are delicious and always a hit. Pick up a dozen for friends and family, then treat yourself to an Apple Fritter. It is seriously the most delicious apple fritter I have ever eaten (and I LOVE me some Apple Fritters). Perfectly crispy/moist/sweet in all the right ways. Definitely recommend :)"
2,"Since they opened in Vegas, I've been wanting to see what all the hype was about, I've been hearing about it across the country; how its the best burger.\nSince it was my first experience I like to go with a plain cheeseburger, if it can stand alone without a bunch of toppings, that will bump you up on my \""best\"" list.\nWhat I initially didn't like was the greasy smell in the restaurant, when we left I smelled like I just got done a shift there. YUCK!\nWell the burger was good, lots of hot gooey cheese, the bun was soft and fresh. Tasted a little bland, so I doubt they season their meat, so it tasted like a burger you may get at a family barbecue or an amusement park. I'd eat it again, but I would choose Smashburger over 5 Guys any day. We got the plain fries, which were pretty gross, they were brown and greasy not crisp at all, we ate maybe 10 fries and threw the rest away.\nI liked that they had a bucket of peanut to snack on while waiting for your burger. Staff was nice and helpful, andswered all my \""firsttimer\"" questions."
0,If you want to miss your flight take Executive Las Vegas. To our Resort it took 35min for them to come and they completely missed picking us up to the airport. Horrible. Absolutely Horrible.
3,"I quite like their pizza.  This tiny little shop on Northern Avenue has a seating facility for approximately 16 people but they have quick turnover during lunchtime and the place is exceptionally well run for a small business. \n\nWhen I went there I wasn't very adventurous with the toppings, just stuck to plain old pepperoni and mushroom. They prepared the pizza right in front of us, the service was quick and the huge slice was so hot that I could hardly hold it with my fingers. They seem to be making changes to and improving their business every week.\n\nMy colleagues and I are definitely going back to Stumpy's to try their subs and more."
4,This place is Legit! Had such a good meal and the soda selection really is awesome! A whole wall dedicated to different sodas in glass bottles! My Gorlfriend had pumpkin pie soda and I had butterscotch root beer and it was delicious!! \n\nDefinitely a win for local restaurants!
2,"No food, no bar, place roles up after 8 pm.  Room is okay but AC doesn't work well and I am watching a tv in bed with a screen size of my iPad.  Lol.  Seriously, check out the tv and the shower head is at my chest.  Definitely a throwback to the yesteryears."
2,"Stadium was REALLY nice... the MORONS in control of the parking...not so much.  I understand that you're not going to get doctors/lawyers/rocket scientists to control parking and move traffic in and out of the game.  HOWEVER, it would be nice if Glendale would pull their heads out of their butts and build a new on/off ramp for the stadium.  It took over 30mins to get out of the parking lot!!  To make it worse..the Cards lost :("
0,"Well, it's cheap and you can park an RV here.  \nWhile it's on the Strip and seems like a good deal, do not stay here.  Stay somewhere else.   \nSeriously, this place needs a total fumigation and makeover.  And maybe a tetanus shot.\nThere are better deals."
4,"Great place for a White Mocha Latte and pastries.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I've been here a handful of times and always have had good experiences.  During the summer the smoothies are great to cool off with (if only for a few minutes)  :-)\n\nIf I have the time, I love to have breakfast here. Or I'll call ahead for pick up.  I've never had to wait long.  I'm be stopping in whenever I get near Scottsdale."
3,Tried the beef gyro...excellent!! Great service too!
0,Just awful- stay away from United at all costs.  Take a train or bus before booking anything on this crap airline
0,"I honestly have never had a bad experience here... My husband and I go all the time. Tonight (9/11/13) we went in at 8:00pm (their website AND store sign say they close at 9:00pm). We walk in (mind you, this is AFTER all the storms have passed through- sky is clear, in fact), there are people who just received their food, and there is another couple that were almost done.. Total of 4 people eating inside. We walk in, and are INSTANTLY (and rudely) told \""were closed due to the storm\"" um... WHAT?? What storm. I laugh and say \""you're kidding right? The storm is over\"" and once again, the cashier says \""we're closed Due. To. The. Storm. Warning\"". So we left. We probably will never go back to this Rachel's Kitchen, or any others. And I will not be recommending this place. It's a shame what customer service has come to. This place ant too special, and I can go down the street, and get the same thing, for less, with better service."
4,Got my Acura TLX tinted here and it only took them an hour to finish the all the windows including the windshield. There are no bubbles. I went with the ceramic and you will notice a huge difference with the temperature in the car. I was helped by Jay and they did a good job on my tint.
3,"Hands down the best burger I've ate.  I ordered Kiki's Burger.  The burger consists of a bun with a hint of sweetness, caramelized strip of bacon, several types of mushrooms and a sweet onion marmalade that balances out the burger perfectly. \n\nThe Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries were very good but did not compare to the burger.\n\nFinally, I also had a side of their oxtail chili. This is definitely something that should be ordered.  Lots of oxtail and cheese!  The beans were kept to a minimum.\n\nOverall I found the food quality was superb.  My only gripe about the place is that it gives off a pretentious vibe.  The decor is lacking.  Walls are painted brown with a couple of TV's.\n\nThe wall above the kitchen area contains two chalkboards with some items of the menu written out.  Don't see the point in that as the words are too small and congested to make out unless you sit close.\n\nOn a final note, the chef making the burgers seemed to have a hard time getting the meat cooked properly when I was there.  I noticed three tables sending their burgers back due to incorrect temperature, including mine.\n\nA positive experience overall and I definitely recommend trying it out."
0,"If I could give a negative rating, I would. Long story short, bill was more than advertised menu price, brought to managers attention (white lady with blonde hair, think Tanya Harding mid-90s look and you will recognize her) she basically said too bad so sad, I said that's not acceptable for a quesadilla to be on the menu for $16.00 and you try to bill $20.00\n\nShe had no recourse or excuse, provided the bill without a pen. I asked for a pen and a waiter standing around (think Marc Anthony reject) threw a pen at me to sign. I immediately let Aria Conceirege know about the level of service being provided at Javier's and they immediately rectified the situation while letting the food and beverage manager know as well. Food was bland and average, nowhere near caliber of original Javier's in so cal."
0,"May or may not be surprising due to the fact that this is a Denny's, but I will outline my latest visit to this location anyways. \n\nBreakfast at Denny's with a fair sized group of 8 on a Saturday morning. The waitress was ditzy and favored the \""elbow in the face\"" serving technique. Although our drinks stayed full, my friend somehow had the luxury of receiving 3 full glasses of coke, despite his first glass not even being close to empty and ended up being waste. Our orders arrived inconsistently and staggered, with meals being brought out seemingly one at a time. This left some of us at the table waiting minutes until everyone had their food. \n\nThe sounding of the FIRE ALARM marked the highlight of the visit. A friend had ordered the cookie dessert (basically a warm cookie topped with ice cream). Not only did she receive the cookie still well into the process of finishing her breakfast, but the waitress had explained that the fire alarm was no concern. She explained the alarm was triggered by leaving the now black and charcoal-smelling cookie placed on our table in the oven too long causing a large amount of  smoke (....hwhat..??!). It was easily the most awful looking, foul smelling dessert I had ever seen brought out of any commercial kitchen. Why the waitress even thought anyone would consider eating a hockey puck is beyond me. Oh, and the cookie was topped with an abundance of ice cream and chocolate sauce so as to conceal the burnt look and smell I'm guessing. SMOOTH MOVE. Obviously after one terrifying bite it was immediately sent back. Needless to say, they were suddenly out of cookies for the day, but that's understandable since its the number one ordered item at 10 am right? Right? The waitress deleted the cookie off the check but nothing else. No alternative dessert, no discount, not even a free OJ. The manager was non existent. \n\nCheap food? Yes. Open late? Yes. If that's all you care about then look no further. I, however, will seek better alternatives that better deserve my hard-earned money.\n\n Thank you."
2,Very metro not the highest quality but it works. Not the funnest area for young couples but not horrible either. Oh yeah the bathroom mirrors have a circular light around them that make your eyes look crazy.
2,"It has been a while since I have been here. This use to be one of my top fav foot spas. I only came here for the one lady who use to work on me.I wish I remembered her name, but she did not speak a lick of English.  She is seriously the best Ever! \nThere are too many bad experiences here and that is why I go to a different place. I have been here many many times. My mom introduced me and I was hooked. At first. I believe they have 3 or 4 locations and I have been to 2. The one on spring mountain is the one I use to go to.\nLet me start....The place is very clean and everyone seems to be nice. I wish they had a least one person who could speak or understand english. It is very hard to communicate. The only one who speaks and understands well is the owner.  So there has been several times I was getting worked onand  the owner calls. It is loud and they seem to be arguing or disagreeing on something. \nThis particular incident I'm about to share has happened to me 3  times! When the lady was working on me and the owner kept calling. Like nonstop. They would share a few words. seem to be arguing and then hang up. I could literally hear the owner yell in the language they were speaking. Half way through my massage, some  other person(my guess, a friend of the owner) would walk in and they would tell me some other person is going to finish up on me and she would start working on them. It is always someone different, but I think that is rude. There was even a time when the person working on me put me on the phone and told me to say no. Then the owner asked if I could get someone else. I said no. She insisted, but I refused. She finally said ok. Then the person working on me thanked me. What kind of business is being run here? You just don't do that to customers. Unfortunately, that did it for me. Don't get me wrong I love what these people can do for me, but I find the owner to be very unprofessional. There has been too many interruptions for me to return."
0,This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to and it's surprising how bad it is. Their sweet tea taste like sewer water and it's not even sweet. I can't even finish the drink! Had to toss it. Their fries are not salty whatsoever and it's so dry. Never again.
1,Not bad but I'd take a bulletproof vest if you go on a Friday or Saturday night. Super duper ghetto!
0,I used to love coming to this location but within the last 8 or 9 months it has really gone DOWNHILL. My drinks are usually fine but whoever is at the front register is always so rude in the mornings and youll be waiting forever. The management of this store really needs some revamping. Not sure what happened but it isn't good.
0,"Crap company. My husband signed up a long time ago at a different house and when we moved into our new house their sensor didn't work on the back door because of some problem with us having a doggy door. We kept the system and never actually got to alarm the system due to the back door issue since we needed to get through the contract period. Finally the period time was over so I had my husband call to cancel the account. They talked him into like 6 months free service and my husband accepted (I gave him an earful because he kept it. Free or not, it was unusable). Anyway, I don't know how much time had gone by but I asked him to call and officially cancel it again and when he did they said he had a $40+ balance on the account for charges and late fees. They never even sent us a bill. He paid them over the phone and was told it was cancelled. This was 2/10/14. On 2/21/14 we received a $17 bill from them that would be due 2/23/14. My husband called on 2/22/14 but they said he would have to call the cancellation dept which is only open on the weekdays. \n\nI see my husband has paid the $17 even though I asked him to talk them out of it. My name isn't on the account so I couldn't call, otherwise they would have received an earful! \n\nJudging by the other reviews I am now worried this still isn't going to be cancelled. Keeping my fingers crossed.\n\nHorrible company, do not get involved with them."
1,"As someone who'd never previously been to a full-service car wash (sorry, lifelong DIY'er), I chose The Carwasher, because I frequently see Mesa PD cars being washed there, and thought \""If they're good enough for our civil servants, they'll probably be good enough for me\"".  I asked about what express packages they offer, as I was about to sell my car, and I wanted to pass it off to the new owner in great physical condition.  I paid for their $39.99 package, which included an exterior wash, tire shine, interior vacuum, window cleaning, and an armor-alling of the interior.\n\nWhile a fair price, and a quick turnaround, my satisfaction ended there.  My wheels were still caked with brake dust, there were multiple dirty water streaks on the doors and on the rear of the car.  Judging by the black splashes all over my fenders after the short drive from the store, it appeared that the tire shine was applied without my tires actually having been cleaned first.  \n\nThere was also so much armor-all on the interior surfaces that everything was wet to the touch.  The steering wheel and pedals were also armor-alled, which is very dangerous, causing both of those surfaces to be slippery!  I had to go over the entire interior of the car myself with a dry microfiber rag to soak it all up.\n\nHad I more than a few minutes to bring my car to its new owners, I would have disputed the service.  While they were courteous, timely and fairly-priced.  I can not recommend The Carwasher in Mesa to potential customers."
3,"Went here for lunch with 3 coworkers recently. We were promptly seated and greeted and had our drinks within minutes. This is the second time I've had Velle Luna food. The first time was \n\nI ordered the combination place with enchilada, taco and, rice and beans. The meal was solid with the exception of the rice, which I thought was a bit dry. I didn't like the big onions in the enchilada, but that is a personal preference and at least I was able to take those out.\n\nOverall, the service level was very good and the food in my opinion was also above average.\n\nMy coworkers ordered a variety of menu items and all enjoyed their meals, but couldn't finish them.\n\nI would say that Valle Lune has some pretty solid food and would go back there without hesitation."
1,"I think this place has amazing fries but it still needs improvement, like they need to speed it up. It took us about maybe 30min. To just get the chicken combo with only 4 small loofy wings and a couple of loopy fries. Plus i think they need to size up the food portions. Plus, the girl who worked at the register said it would only be 7minutes for the chicken combo! I honestly think this place is horrible and the service is honestly disgraceful.  ;(\n\nAlso employees needs to work together and apologize to customers for the long unacceptable wait for a freaken fries and chix wings. Like seriously?"
4,"Love this place! Who wouldn't love a place where you can drink and play games? It is really small, so it can get a little loud. It is easy to meet other people though, because of the small space. They have a great selection of wine and beer. The owners also make yummy little treats and pass them around for free :)."
0,"Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels."
1,"Visited here while I was in town for spring training 3 different times. This place gets pretty busy, and I don't mind waiting for my drink but they didn't know how to handle the rushes very well. They wouldn't call out drinks or names rather let them sit there to be picked up. The line moved really slowly and the crew seemed like they weren't all working together or communicating. I will say they did make my drink perfect each time, can't compain there."
1,"I have been to NYNY several times and on several trips we've thought about eating here but we always end up going somewhere else b/c the prices seem kinda high for what they actually give you. If a side salad cost $7 - seems suspect when I can go to outback and order a real salad for $10.  anyway my bf was hungry and I didnt want the cranky to set in and we didnt want to go any farther than we already had at the hour. We probably couldve driven to Summerlin and been eating before out dinner came out here. \n\nSERVICE: ALARMINGLY SLOW. Couldnt believe it took SOOOO long. We got there around 645. It took over an HOUR to get our food. The place was kinda empty. I ordered a cobb salad and he ordered rice and shrimp. last time I ckd shrimp cooks really fast? so I dont knwo what took an hour other than poor communication. \nTheres someone to give you water, theres another person to give you your food, theres a differen person to take your order. We saw the water girl way more than we saw our server, which at this point we decided they jsut forgot to turn in the order and that must be why it took that long. the table in front of us had more people, sat down after us and ate and left and we still had yet to take our first bite. sad. \n\nFOOD: the plate was ok, not anythign I'd order again. THe bacon was good and crunchy which I like but oh so greasy. . to the point it made me sick. i wasnt alone... my bf felt fine till I gave him a bite of the bacon oops I mean grease with bacon. ah .. lets put it this way. the food @ Hard Rock Cafe was way better and we all know they arent known for great cuisine.  \nwould I come back? no I would not. Its a 24 hr place but so is walmart and mcdonald's."
0,"Usually adequate service in the pharmacy spoiled by the blond trainee / intern. Her name may be Linda. Needed pain meds asap for husband in serious pain from broken leg.  Woman did not care, said we had to be taken care of after others... had to come back in an hour. You can fill the routine to be picked up tomorrow singular prescription later honey! A man right in front of you in pain should come first!  Now two days later, after leg put in traction rig, blondie says with no compassion at all that they don't have the pain med prescribed, did not offer to call another CVS and she could see my husband suffering in the back seat with rods sticking out of his leg. This woman should not be in a customer service job as she couldn't care less about suffering people. I am moving to the McQueen and Warner location. The staff there have some customer service skills and some compassion."
0,"I swear, people have the most disgusting palates in Vegas.\n\nI ordered the \""Crazy\"" Alfredo (advertised as a \""favorite\"").  Crazy is right.  Expired chicken, overcooked rubbery shrimp, and it all tasted like it was cooked the previous week, stored, and microwaved for service.\nMy wife ordered spaghetti with meat sauce.  How can you screw that up?  I don't know how you can, but Nora's did.  The sauce was watery and the meat chunks so small it can literally be drunk and not chewed.\n\nSeriously, my wife almost went across the street to Smiths to pick up a bottle of Progresso to put on hers.\n\nI tried this place once about a year ago and figured I'd give it one more chance.  Never again.\n\nThis place seriously needs Gordon Ramsay to do his Kitchen Nightmares show.  It screams outdated, lack of standards, and absolutely disgusting food.\n\nThere was one semi-redeeming quality - the store bought bread they served was loaded with roasted garlic.  That was pretty decent."
2,"I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. \n\nRandom musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. \n\nThe highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. \n\nFor where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor."
0,"If you don't have alot of money, you're best choosing a different dentist.\n\nI'm writing this review after a very uncomfortable and unpleasant experience with Harris Dental. I am super disappointed that I won't be going to this dentist for my dental health and cosmetic work because I was so excited when I first started the process.\n\nI can tell you Dr. Brian Harris and Dr. Joe Harris are amazing, kind and very professional. It was Dr. Joe's manner and thoughtful nature that had me take on two jobs just to be able to afford the $6000+ in work that they quoted me. The staff? Not so much.\n\nThe thing is, most people, especially in this challenging economy do not have affordable health care much less affordable dental care. Like me, many are not able to finance the high cost of dental work and definitely no cosmetic care. I am someone that, as a single mom put off and put off my own dental needs instead choosing to take care of the needs of my family. Now that they are grown I finally felt this was the time I could allow myself the joy of a beautiful smile and healthy teeth - not so fast.\n\nEven with budgeting these high priced procedures and working multiple jobs to take on the expense, the $400 and $500 cash out of pocket is difficult so I had to phone the office today to try and either reschedule or to see about other payment options - I wanted badly to make my appointment as I have waited so many years for my new smile! I needed to pick up another client to cover the costs as my savings was asked of for family needs this month - what did I get when I called the office? I was scolded by the receptionist, told by the assistant, \""you didn't know 48 hours ago you didn't hav e enough money? Now you are causing us and the doctor to have breaks in the day we won't be able to fill and that's costing us money.\"" I realize if I could I should have contacted them sooner, but seriously? Have you been to Harris Dental? The decor and equipment alone is worth more than most salaries.\n\nAnyway the point to my post is I'm really disappointed I won't be continuing with Harris Dental and I wanted to tell anyone here that they are probably the best in the city, but if you are working class or a single mom with a tight budget and responsibilities, your better off choosing a lesser known dentist that might be sympathetic to your situation and be willing to work with you on the upfront costs.\n\nI'm determined to get the new smile I've always wanted! If you have a dentist to recommend please share with me!"
0,"Not a fan of the Luxor, It has become somewhat run down, and the service and hospitality on my last visit was terrible.  Unfortunately even after trying to resolve several issues with the management, nothing was offered me despite being a mlife and rapid reward customer to compensate for the lack of fulfillment of the promises made in the all inclusive show, and the fees not disclosed until after purchase, also the run around you get when you try to get help. also the timeshare people in the lobby that are dressed just like the other employees are very aggressive compared to other hotels on the strip.  Small Dirty room, poor air quality, slow cleaning service. not a good time for me.  Maby if I was 21 and just needed a place to crash cheaply, but there are so many better deals in nicer hotels available. Very dated, and the WiFi was horrible. Had to go out into the hallway to get reception even though they had a router in the room dangling in the closet."
4,This was probably the dining highlight of our entire Vegas vacation.  Our waiter Matthew was very friendly and brought with him some very enthusiastic suggestions.  These included:\n\n- The Scallop appetizer\n\n- The Filet Mignon with merlot wine sauce reduction \n\n- The New York Strip with a special mushroom sauce.\n\n- Off-menu creme brulee.\n\nHe was bang on with every suggestion.... (especially that filet mignon-  the sauce was buttery ecstasy!) though the kitchen was out of the creme brulee necessities so he gave us a dessert of our choice and comped it.    We chose the bananas foster and would declare it a victory.  After a glass of madeira the bill came out to $100 plus tip and in Vegas I'd call it a darn good value.
1,"Any other casino but gosh dang it!  I hate that \""jackpot hand pay\"" in slot machine is $200 and up. It takes them long time to come pay \""jackpot\"" $200 and they always give me seven $20 and two $10s wait around for $5-$10 tip for slowly bringing \""jackpot\"" $200. Lol \n\nHonestly what casino makes 200$ jackpot ? And expect any tip for it? Most people lose $200 in 10 min on slots. \n\nI wish other casino was closer to me at least their \""jackpot handpay\"" is the standard above 1200  just feel like they r finding way to rip even more money off.... No one want to tip on 200$ when it takes $300 to get it . Make it more convenient and people will happily tip more I'm sure .   Some of the slot people are sooo rude too.   People are losing tons of money daily so it's very bad to be rude ....  \n\nOther than that table games are fine, slot selections are okay, regular staff is okay, it's normal casino.  Please fix the hand pay system."
3,One of my favorite places to see a show.
1,"My Wife insisted we try this place because she's really into hot wings. Gotta' tell you.... very, very mediocre. Extremely average. It was a nice atmosphere- It was the last day of the regular hockey season with some important (playoff implication) games going on. Service was really good too... But, Food was really lacking and it was barely OK. To top that, I can't stand when my food is served in a plastic basket! If I'm paying Nine Bucks for a hamburger, at least give me a frickin' PLATE!!!!! Way overpriced  as well."
3,"My mother can't live without the soup-style beans, and she's right. I get the Clare burro, which has queso fresco, whole pinto beans, and avocado. I also usually get some guacamole, which is very chunky here, and add a bit of salt to eat with the chips. \n\nIt's a family place for me, I don't ever really like it as much when I try to take other people, and this is the second move I can remember. My folks are sticking by this one, and I am happy to tag along!"
0,"I've ordered from king & I a couple times now.. All has gone well, up until tonight. \n\nA friend and I are having an anti-valentines dinner.. Or so we thought. Placed an order on eat24 at 8pm. Their delivery estimate says 45-60 mins. We realized it was vday, so realistically it would probably take an hour. Both times I had ordered before, it had been half an hour and they had called to let me know they were at the gate. \n\nWhen I hadn't heard anything at 9pm, I followed up with eat 24. Said they spoke with the restaurant and the driver was on his way. Great. No biggie. When no one was here at 9:25, I decided to just call the restaurant myself. Their phone was either off the hook, or they were deliberately ignoring calls. If it weren't for eat24, I would still have been charged for my food. Luckily they gave us a full refund. \n\nIf you're too busy to keep up with your orders, then fine. At least call your customer to apologize and explain that you wouldn't be able to make it. Their food may be good, but this experience was unacceptable."
1,"Don't come here for the Mexican food. Don't come here for the awesome service. DO come here for a rollicking good time.\n\nMy sweetie pop and I had a Groupon, and we both LOVE Mexican food, so we decided to stop by after seeing the 4pm comedy magic show with Nathan Burton. We sat out on the patio near the outdoor bar. The first thing I noticed about the menu is that this place is EXPENSIVE!\n\nOur server--Britany--was exceptionally adorable. She seemed genuinely helpful and wanted to ensure that our meal was done correctly, but she was quite \""green\"" as a server. We placed our order for an entree salad as our appetizer and our food order at the same time. By the time we had taken 3 bites from our GINORMOUS salad the food runner came out with our plates. I protested and let him know (wasn't it obvious?!) that we hadn't even begun to finish our salad . He said he would bring the food back later, and he came back not more than 5 minutes later and tried to server our plates again. Really?! Yeah, we were still eating the salad, he could see that, but he still looked bewildered as to why we didn't want our entrees at that point in time.\n\nSo, finally,  another lady brings out our food, and lo! I behold the world's smallest $15 chicken burrito! Egad, I asked for a \""wet\"" burrito, and they put the sauce on the bottom of the plate. Hmm, since when did wet plate = wet burrito? I'll never know.\n\nSweetie Pop ate the chicken enchiladas with a combination of the red and the green sauce. Salsa verde is my favorite, but theirs isn't done well here. The red sauce was much better: spicy and delicious. I've NEVER been hungry after eating an entree sized burrito, but my tiny little chicken burrito was downright pathetic. Who puts CUBED chicken in a burrito anyway? Carlos and Charlie's does.\n\nWe were attended by a number of servers, the manager and food runners. However, when we asked the same genius (insert sarcasm here:_____________) who kept bringing our food out prematurely for some water with lemons, he proceeded to bring out one glass of water and a saucer with exactly ONE, according to Sweetie Pop,  \""sad, sorry, sucked on lemon\"" on it. Britney promptly corrected his error (after all there were TWO of us, so why not bring each of us  some water and lemons?) and she apologized for the series of food service mishaps.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend this place for the giant nachos (I saw them on someone else's table)  and the beverages. Thursday is Ladies Night, and ladies get all you can drink frozen margaritas. Bonus! After dinner we danced to the few line dances, and had a good time before calling it a night.\n\nCarlos and Charlie's is a place for fun, not food! Those nachos looked pretty exciting though, and as my girlfriend once told me, \""It's hard to F**K up nachos.\"" Too true.\n\np.s. Contrary to the sign on the way into the building advertising Carlos and Charlie's their happy hour has NOT been \""extended until further notice.\"" It only goes until 6pm...Another disappointment since we arrived at 6:04pm. *sigh*"
0,"In the past year this place went down the hill. Not such a big variety of food like used to be, prices skyrocket high but the worst thing is service. People behind the counter does not know what customer service is, specially when older couple works there during daytime. Rude, unprofessional, always making rude jokes and very very slow. Also, never change cloves- even after counting money they go  right to the cutting meat and don't feel like it's something wrong with using same gloves. Pre-made salads are expensive and consist of mainly mayo. The rest of the food is overpriced and not a good quality"
2,I like the location and room rates for the TI ....the hotel and rooms are in need of some major updating ......
0,"I find it astonishing there are so many good reviews about this school because It's been an absolute nightmare from beginning to end, There is zero communication between parents and teachers, You call and leave a message for a teacher and receive no call back. It's near impossible to get a message through at all, I don't know if the messaging service on the EKA website is flawed or the staff and teacher's just don't care but I've attempted on several occasions to contact my 2nd graders teachers and received no response. I've written letters, same thing. I'm just so frustrated I can't believe their able to be run this way. \n\nI would strongly discourage any parents looking into this school to steer clear and look elsewhere if you care about being involved in your child's education at all. Some of us parents still believe in being hands on parents. You're not going to be able to be that here."
4,"I love going to Dr. Baldwin! I've been seeing him for about 3 years, and since I've been in Charlotte I've tended to switch dentists once or twice a year because I just haven't liked any of them. Dr. Baldwin puts you at ease, does a good job, and at a fair price. I agree with the other reviewer that he is not just out for the money. I had wisdom teeth removed, and he told me that while he could and would do it if I wanted him to, he would feel more comfortable with me going to a specialist since it was close to the nerve. \n\nThe office girls are very friendly and always ask me about things we talked about on previous visits."
1,the chile rellenos were actually ok but how the heck do you eff up rice and beans! it was bleh nothing special and definitely not worth $12 for my meal. the service was good the server was very sweet. the seating was ridiculous though it was a monday night not many people were there so i dont understand why we were squished in a middle table with both our kids. i will never be eating there again
0,"If it were not for the chips and salsa, I would never return to this restaurant. I have been going there since I was a kid. In the past year or so, the service has gotten so bad, I wouldn't even believe it is the same restaurant. I only get carry out now, and that is only when I am craving the chips and salsa. \n\nEven their carry out food service is terrible, unfortunately. My past 4 visits, I have called over 30-45 minutes in advance to my order, and upon arrival nobody has prepared it. During one visit (The Friday before 2012 Superbowl), it took me 45 minutes AFTER I arrived for them to get me 2 bags of chips and 2 portions of salsa. Another woman had been waiting there longer than me. We were both waiting on chips and salsa ONLY. That should never happen.\n\nMy last visit was 3/3/12 and again, I called 35 minutes before arriving to order chips and salsa for a party. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before being greeted. The hostess then went to \""find out\"" who took my order and returned and told me I had to go to the cantina/bar to pay and get them. Once I got in there, I stood for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone walking by so I could get my order. Finally a man brought it to me. I was so fed up. I do not think I can return. I am sick of being treated like they don't need or even WANT my business.\n\nI have never received an apology from any of them for taking so long, and not having my order ready, even when I gave them plenty of notice AND the orders were simple."
0,"We stopped for breakfast at this Mimi's on our way out of town and oh my... what a disappointment. I have been to Mimi's at Desert Ridge and Metrocenter, and they have been OK, but we would never come back to this one.\n\nThe food was very plain, the plate looked huge with just a few potatoes... My husband ordered hot tea and the cup they brought him was nasty. I understand some stains are hard to remove, but I did clean some smudges with my finger...\n\nWhen we brought it to the attention of our waitress, she behaved like, 'oh there are just coffee stains...' but still took it to replace it. \nSince no one brought another cup, we asked the person that brought our food, (yep, that is how long it took) and just then she was in her way to our table...\nShe even said it took her so long because she had to go 'hunt' for a clean cup...\nWhat kind of excuse is that?\n\nWe also had asked for crispy bacon, she even wrote it twice, and yet we got regular bacon. We sent it back and even after that it was not crispy at all...\nSo yeah, they didn't pass the crispy bacon test.\n\nOh well..."
4,"I had my miniature poodle neutered at Niki's place and was treated so well.  They are so compassionate and really helped my emotions and worry about my brand new puppy.  It's hard to get a new baby and then send them under the knife!  They calmed my fears and told me what to expect.  Add to that their amazing charitable pricing structure, compared to the \""corporate\"" vet clinics out there.  I highly recommend them to all my friends.  They also give immunizations and dental care at a very reasonable price, which is awesome!"
4,"We decided to have our anniversary dinner at Carve since we were already staying in the hotel. The ambience was quiet and sophisticated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was incredible. The lobster bisque was smooth, creamy and very tasty, with lots of lobster bits. We ordered the flat iron steak special. It came with steamed, diced zucchini, yellow squash & carrots and buttery garlic mashed potatoes. It was perfection! The bill wasn't too bad either! I highly recommend checking this place out when you are at the Eastside Cannery."
2,"We have eaten at the Wicked Spoon two times now.  We decided to do this one because our 4 & 2 year old kids are free.  The first time we had the breakfast buffet on a Sunday.  It was OK, nothing that really stood out to us.  \n\nLast night we tried the dinner buffet hoping our meal would be better and we could finally understand the hype about this buffet...there were several selections like Chinese, Mac and cheese station, meats, salads, gourmet cheeses, tons of dessert options, pizza, and several other things.  The best thing I had was the shepherds pie.  The worst was the lamb Indian dish which had small chunks of fatty lamb.  I would take a bite then had to spit it out and chew around the fat.  My husband found a long black hair in his food.  The server offered him a free drink to make up for it.  \n\nIn my opinion the best part was the dessert station.  All of the desserts were very good and huge selection.\n\nNext time I think we will try the Bellagio or Caesars Palace buffet."
2,"It's quite difficult to review the Forth Floor, because much like Dave S. I had quite a mixed experience. We met Executive Chef Stuart Muir, who talked with great passion and enthusiasm about his beautifully sourced ingredients. But the tasting menu that followed was bizarrely over-complicated, with flavours crashing into each other like runaway dodgems.\n\nOverall, we said: \""the tasting menu at the Forth Floor is a confused creature. While the dishes are relentlessly interesting and very pleasing on the eye, their tapestry of flavours isn't woven with anything like the required accuracy and balance. Dishes are riotous, but not in a good way. I will definitely return, though, because I imagine their fruit de mere, which keeps things simple and showcases their superbly sourced ingredients, will be an absolute joy. For truly balanced and elegant fine dining dishes, look elsewhere.\"""
3,"Am ashamed to say I have filled up my punch card, twice.  Usually get the Hook and Ladder.  But the main reason I keep going back...the magical Coke machine of Awesomeness."
1,"1st: It's a Boston pride sports bar/grill/restaurant type place. Everything you want to know about Boston is hanging on the walls and playing on their TV's. I actually thought it was pretty cool. \n\n2nd: The music they were playing was completely random, and sucky. I was trying to pinpoint the genre. I think I even said out loud, \""Are the artists they're playing all from Boston, because I'm not getting this music??\"" It was mostly mid 90's alternative/contemporary. Not that cool for a sports bar, even though I knew every song that came on, but I'm not normal. \n\n3rd: Nobody liked their food at my table, including me, and I rarely complain about pizza. Even bad pizza is okay pizza, but it really wasn't that great. Little Caesar's? I dunno. \n\n4th: They do have great Happy Hour specials 7 days a week, 1/2 priced drinks and 5 dollar appetizers, and they've got that trivia night thing going for them. \n\n5th: I hate it when the server automatically assumes a guy is paying for the meal, and gives the check to one of the guys at a table. I'm not some liberal-feminist-type, but yes, some girls do pay for meals out."
4,I had a brilliant time in here. The music was loud but not shouty loud. They took song requests and dished out free popcorn whilst singing and dancing to the tunes.\nFrom the name and the decor it looks a little bit more straight laced but that certainly wasn't the case on Saturday night!
0,"I don't know where to start.  There were 3 of us for dinner Friday 3/8/13.  We arrived timely for our reservation, after requesting drinks, the waiter announced that he had \""never heard of  that\""; having tomato juice on the side of a martini.  Ok, moving on, Carl asked for blue cheese dressing, and our curmudgeon waiter's response was \""are you crazy, you are in an italian restaurant, not french\"" ?  How do you, as a customer, process this?  Next, the food came, salad, with the house dressing, awful and sweet, the mussels not fresh and the baked clams were good, however, complete with a piece of rock salt in the dish.  Off to a really bad start.  One special ordered piece of fish (frozen at best) and the shrimp scampi-greasy on a bed of fetuccini alfredo, and chicken piccata-looked like it was removed from the Delta business class kitchen, and tasted the same.  I must say, it would be hard to find a worse meal in Phx, anywhere for that matter, and this is one of the only times in my life that I left a 10% tip based on really rude service.  We almost left after the cocktail debacle, but foolishly stayed for the rest of the abuse to follow.  This place is way past its prime."
1,"This place has a cute selection and is pretty affordable compared to the other meager shopping options currently on Mill, but if I'm in the mood to shop Pitaya wouldn't be one of my first choices. Maybe it was because I visited during the middle of a weekday, but I got the vibe that the salesgirl wished I would leave, because she was talking to a friend when I came in and I guess that my presence made her feel the need to talk in whispers. And when she did help me, she seemed annoyed about it.\n\nI did end up buying a couple of things from there, only to find the SAME EXACT SKIRT for maybe $8 cheaper at LoveCulture in Scottsdale Mall. I kid you not. If I can get the same clothes for cheaper elsewhere, then I don't think I'll be going back."
2,"Been meaning to try after rave reviews from co-workers.  Prices are reasonable,service is good and great location. The food was pretty tasty. Be warned a few items are misnomers. Ex. Garlic fries were shoestring and not very garlicky? No need to describe plain items as fancy/premium sides. Would come back and try brunch which is offered on weekend."
3,"This is a small, cozy restaurant that is unique. The food is fresh and tasty. The sandwiches, salad, and spring rolls are very good. It is a little expensive for what it is but I will definitely go back and try dinner options."
1,"I waited patiently for the restaurant to open. I was disappointed. Price is around $15 per person w drink, the food is ok, just ok. Very unorganized. I waited in line approximately 50 minutes, and I was rushed aside by waiters coming to get refills for people. That's right you get your drink while you're waiting in line, which is very uncomfortable when you have small children. I think even if you didn't have children with you it would be uncomfortable. they attract a loud, disrespectful, and inconsiderate kind of clientele, as my family and I couldn't even hear each other of how loud and obnoxious people around were. Managment seemed to be ok with that type of behavior. We had to fight our way to our table of how packed and unorganized things were. So if you're looking for a quiet, and high class place to done in, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I did enjoy the cotton candy and chocolate strawberries, and their staff is very friendly. This alone is why I give it a 2, if not I would've given a total zero!!!"
0,"I just spent a weekend here at the Paris hotel and casino. I've stayed here in Las Vegas before in many different hotels and this is by far the WORST one. I mean I am talking about absolutely horrible service. The staff here is extremely rude with no customer service skills. I had called down stairs at 2 am to have a remote control delivered up to my room because it was missing one. The housekeeping staff failed to deliver one, instead, they decided to barge into my room at 6:00 AM TO GIVE ME MY REMOTE. WHAT THE ****! My mother & her friend were also staying here on the same floor a door down. Housekeeping had managed to clean my room but had not cleaned my mothers room for a full day. When my mother called down stairs for some service the housekeeping maids arrived at their room with complete attitude asking what they wanted done. FOR STARTERS... THE WHOLE ROOM WHAT ELSE?! Ridiculous! \nIT GETS WORSE! \nONE hour later.. five security guards come knocking at my mothers friends room and demand her to leave instantly, because the maid reported that she had thrown something at her. CRAZY!!! After completely badgering my mothers friend.. She packed up her belongings and was forced to leave at 1 am in the morning. She was banned from the hotel. She was not even allowed to explain to the security department that NOTHING like that happened and the maid was probably only pissed off because they had complained to the house keeping department. My mother and her friend then left and stayed at a different hotel for the night. Worst hotel, horrible service, and rude employees. NEVER STAY HERE EVER."
1,"I was impressed by the roller coaster when I first walked in.  I would suggest walking around dors before you buy the all day pass.  It might not be worth it in every situation.  Some activities are not included in the all day pass, so bear that in mind.  Roller coaster is cool, bumper cars, and a few others.  I probably shouldn't have purchased the all day pass though."
2,They get three stars from me. It's still a nice little place to get southern soul food. The place is extra tiny but the food rocks. This maybe the best place to get grits in Vegas. I always get the catfish & grits.
2,"I got the sabor especiale burrito. The rice is very flavorful. You certainly receive a lot of food for a fair price. I would certainly like to try other items on the menu. They don't have any beer on draft, but a nice bottle selection. Ok so upon more eating (I couldn't stop thinking about it)..much better. I could eat a bowl of the rice alone. I'm also one of those people who prefer things cold. So after some chilling..yum!! I also love that guacamole is included in my burrito, unlike some other places who shall remain nameless. I am certainly excited about going back to try more items."
0,"This place is an absolute dump.\n\nEven as a guy, I feel sorry for the girls who, regrettably, think it's a good decision to go here as part of a bachelorette party. It is FILLED with fat, nasty, sketchy dudes in their 50's who will salivate over any girl in their 20's. \n\nAs a guy, the bartenders there are absolutely nothing to get excited about. Many bars in big cities - not to mention nearly every bar/club in Vegas - will have much hotter bartenders than those who work here. They're in really good shape - mostly because they're forced to dance all evening - but that's about it.\n\nBachelor party, Bachelorette party, regular party, or for any other reason - just stay away from here. We got free admission passes AND buy one-get one free drink passes, and I still thought going there was big waste of time."
2,"If it looks like a diner, smells like a diner, has slippery floors and drunk people like diner...its just a diner. I will say, the chicken and waffles were delicious as was the shrimp half of the shrimp and grits. A word of advice...leave your party about an hour early to avoid the line that will run outside and down the block after the clubs close."
2,"So for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular."
1,"We bought couches from Walker, and were very happy with the process from start to finish, so it seemed like a natural choice to return to them when we wanted to buy a new bed.  We found a set we were really happy with.  We paid last weekend, and they agreed to deliver today.\n\nWaited around this morning so Walker Furniture could deliver my new bed, only they delivered the wrong size, and to top things off our bed is backordered until the end of April now.  This is after we sat around the showroom for 40 minutes so they could make sure everything in the paperwork was correct (Ha!).  \n\nThe best they could do is give me a \""temporary bed\"" until ours comes in (although not the style we selected), which sounds like way more hassle than it's worth.  I would have really recommended Walker to my friends up to this point, but I think I'll be looking for a new furniture store for my next purchase, since basically I'm waiting a month for a bed I was told was in stock.  Sure, they said \""sorry\"", but I'd rather just find a place that can manage their inventory properly instead."
0,"I appreciate Toby Keith's musical ability, but if this restaurant is any indication of his culinary skills, he needs to hang em up. This place is horrible. Server recommended the steak, it was bad quality, mac and cheese was a step above Kraft. Pepsi products as well. My wife's nachos were literally inedible,  she had to send em back which she never does. If we hadn't had a free meal coupon from a timeshare thing, we never would have come after seeing the reviews, and now even with the coupon we wouldn't come back."
1,"The wash was less than ok.  I quit Terrible's for the same experience here.  Inside, didn't bother to vac the crumbs on the seats, mats had crumbs. didn't swipe the drink cup holders.  They cleaned the inside windshield and top of dash but didn't bother to wipe down the instrument panel, steering wheel areas, etc.  On the outside didn't wipe down the white wheel wheels and other details like that.  I hope I caught them on a bad day because I like having a carwash close to home.  I'll give them one more try and that's it.  Otherwise it's back to Freddy's who have yet to give me a bad wash, even if I have to drive a bit further.  They are overpriced too."
1,"You know Mexican food isn't going to be very authentic when you enter a restaurant and all of the employees are Caucasian.  Our server was friendly and bubbly, but she put my order in wrong and they forgot part of my wife's order.  The food was less than average, watered down Americanized Mexican food.  If you've had any of the similar chains in Charlotte like Azteca or Zapata's, those are much better.  The food at Charanda didn't taste much different than Mexican food I've made at home, and that's not saying much."
1,"When you are a customer on the hunt for a decent spec laptop then you'd be expecting a decent service but in the future, this would be my last rather than first port of call.\n\nI have to say, the guy who served me first was really nice - knew the spec of what I was looking for and knew his stuff when it came to the product so the fault lies with the manager here.\n\nNot many places would be turning down a cash customer in a recession going for a sale of \u00a3700 but the manager here did. Why? I asked for \u00a350 off the *display* laptop - on display, none left in the back so a fair request but no can do. Really? \n\nI used to work in sales so I know discount is a no-go if a customer is paying by credit card or interest free credit - as for moi, it was a cash sale, no extra charges to be taken from the store in the form of credit so there should have not been an issue. Most people would ask for some form of discount off a display item - what I was asking for wasn't even equivalent to 10% of the price, despite the fact it would have been handled by anyone checking out the product and had accumulated a few marks that wouldn't be present on a stockroom item.\n\nSo, PC world, to my knowledge, very few retailers are doing THAT well they can afford to turn down sales of that price. PS - went to John Lewis, paid less for a higher spec laptop and I'll GO back there!"
2,"Good but far from Great.\n\nNot sure if it's the Persian style but the food here just doesnt compare to my usual middle eastern eateries.\n\nOn the plus side the Hummus is quite possibly the BEST HUMMUS i've ever had. If i could i would buy a 16oz drink cup size of it and suck it through a straw.\n\nThe number 13 Shredded Beef and Lamb specialty plate is reasonably priced at 8.99, one of the few lamb dishes to remain the same cost from the to go menu to the main board. \n\nOn the side you get a small mixed green salad, a wedge of lemon, a glop of hummus (soo good..), a dolmeh, a small container of yogurt with cucumber sauce, and your...i guess it was a wrap. \n\nThe dolmeh was good but when paired with the yogurt sauce whoa that was something. \n\nThe wrap itself left something to be desired. I did enjoy the taftoon bread, it had a nice freshness to it and was different from the pita i'm used to. The meat was seasoned a little too well. Near the end of my meal i could hardly recall if there was any lamb in it seeing as the spices were so heavy it masked any individual taste of the meat itself. What little hummus and cucumber yogurt i had left were thrown on the wrap and it did improve the taste. Toward the end i reached for a bottle of franks red hot to liven things up a bit. \n\nAlso ordered a Lamb & Beef Gyro.\nI missed the lunch special by an hour so instead of 3.99 for gyro only i had to pay the standard price for the entire meal. Not really a problem.\n\nAli at Kebab Korner has spoiled me. Even when he tried to singe my taste buds by making his famous super gyro 'burn my ass' (his actual words to his staff \""one super gyro, super spicy! BURN HIS ASS!!') with it's level of spiciness it just made me want more.\n\nThis gyro is extremely mellow, the meat was a bit dry and inside covered with yogurt cucumber sauce. It was good but it to me it just tasted shallow and empty compared to Kebab Korner.\n\nBeing considerably closer than Kebab Korner i might consider coming back a few time to take advantage of the lunch specials."

4,"I work with Vitaly every time. He knows foreign cars inside out. I have a factory Honda and was pleased to find out that he can help with repairs of any type, not just performance mods. My entire family has been using Pitstop for over 5 years and he'll be our mechanic for life!"
1,"The gelato is just okay, but it's really expensive. The thing that got to me was we got attitude because we were using Groupons-- even though we spent an extra $40 over and above the value of the Groupons. Plus the guy added a bunch of restrictions to the Groupon that weren't included in the fine print. If the gelato had been exceptional, none of this would have mattered. It wasn't."

3,"Stevey does Chandler, Part Tres.  (The DVD boxed set will be out soon, btw.)\n\nI typically try to avoid malls and avoid treks to Chandler, but if I MUST shop at a mall I like going to Chandler Fashion Center.  I find it to be a happy medium between the mundane average joe malls of the Valley and the luxury malls of Scottsdale.\n\nIt has an interesting layout, a respectable Nordstrom, a decent restaurant/theater area - and a mix of typical chain stores you'd find at a mall - but stores that people can actually afford to shop at.  Cheers to that."
0,"My Clients and I decided to try this restaurant out....food is very good, waitress was wonderful and then it all fell apart.  In walks this lady with a PIGEON that looks like it went through a storm and it was on top of her head.  We were appalled and it made us want to get up and leave.  Had we seen her in the restaurant earlier, we would have left.  We asked the waitress why they would allow this PIGEON to be in the restaurant?  Response:  The person is a little off and she has been in here before for dinner.  I asked to see the Manager but was told that he is aware of it and did not tell the Waiters/Waitresses to ask her to please take the filthy PIGEON outside.  It is way okay to explain to anyone that any animal (in this case a nasty, dirty PIGEON)  inside a restaurant is NOT ACCEPTABLE.  Instead of asking her to leave, the restaurant has now lost 3 great customers.  Shame on Maya......this is a major health issue and would probably have been fined or shut down, if the Inspector was there....guess I might have to call the Inspection people."
0,"Only gave one star cause i had to. Do not waste your time with this company. My landlord made an appt with them to do a home clean out from the last tenants. She called and spoke with a lady that was very nice saying that they would be able to be there the next day by 11. She bought a groupon for 160dollars worth of cleaning and asked if the house needed more cleaning then just 160's worth what would happen. The lady said they wouldn't just \""leave you hanging\"" that they would stay till the job was done. Sounds good. Well my landlord waited at the house from 11-12:30 no cleaners. Called the company and the lady on the phone said that she saw the house on the schedule and would call her right back after she called the crew to see where they were. Yeah never called back. My landlord called me and said she would leave the house open and a note on the door incase they showed up. My boyfriend and i waited till 3pm to show up at the new place. Yep still nothing! My landlord has been calling for 3days and still no calls back. Such a waste of time!!!! Why did they even bother answering the phone the first time if they don't want your business!?!?!????!!"
0,"The worst ross.\n\nBuilt in such a cramped space. Weird layout have to take two scalators to get to women clothes, hate it!! Tons and tons of people. Super slow cashiers n Huge enormous line at checkout...\n\nYes they have good deals, but next time i will skip this Ross, save the hassle and avoid this jungle."
0,"I wish I could rate 0 stars. I called and placed an order for delivery that was a struggle to get through because she didn't speak or understand English. Then after an hour of waiting, I called back to see where my order was and another person answers and says that she thought I canceled my order. I said why would she think that, I gave my card info and everything and she said 30 mins. So then I ask when my order will now be delivered and she says that she thinks they don't deliver here. I say ok, but you just delivered here 2 weeks ago so she says well, that was 2 weeks ago-BEYOND astonished at how rude that was!! I told her they really need to get their act together and that that was terrible customer service and hung up. RUDE!"
1,"Came in on a Sunday around 12:30 and there wasn't really a wait.\n\nFree baguette and butter.  Warm and crusty bread for free?  what's not to love about that?\n\nTook a while for our food to come out for some reason. Went thru 2 baguettes, while waiting. Steak classique with frites. We ordered medium rare but it came out kinda grey with grill marks so definitely more rare than medium. Steak frites were pretty much potato chip strips.\n\ncorned beef hash was served with 2 poached eggs and toast with blackened crust(unintentionally i'm sure) and hash browns on the side \n\nI might consider coming back to maybe find something redeeming on the menu."
3,"My husband and I took the kids to see \""The Lorax\"" and man, was it packed! We had to sit down in the bottom section, but it didn't hurt my neck too bad. And the theater was clean & cool as always. Popcorn tasted good, red vines were soft, and they actually have Dr. Pepper, not Mr. Pibb."
2,"Although i've been here over 10 times, this is my first review. The atmosphere is great, the drinks are tasty, but so damn crowded at all times! 4th of July was insanely packed. There was no room in the pool!"
1,"This was the first time I went to this location. It was Friday night but it wasn't busy at all. We were in the pool room in the back. The server managed to come around about every 45 minutes, and when she did she would ask 1 of us if we were good and then leave. The last time she came around she asked if we were good and I said, \""2 more please.\"" When she came back over a half hour later we asked where the drinks were and she said that we said we were good. Then she continued to argue with us when we told her we asked for 2 more. \n\nWe left shortly after and were surprised to see a gratuity of 18% charged automatically to our bill for the two of us. I know that's common practice for a group of 6 or more, but for 2 people?\n\nI dot think I will be coming back to this place anytime soon. Drinks are a bit expensive but not terrible for the area. Interior is nice. Didn't get any food so idk how that is."
0,"The worst customer service ever. We bought a washer and dryer there, heard nothing for two weeks, then randomly got a phone call saying they would deliver around noon that day. Thanks for the heads up!? I was at work and noon was about twenty minutes away, so obviously couldn't just leave my job in the middle of the day. I asked for them to come the next day (saturday), they gave me a four hour time window telling us we would get a call between 8-12.  They randomly showed up around 1:45, this is after I called the store at noon to check on where they were. We waited around and wasted our entire Saturday. When they arrived and did the install the dryer wouldn't turn on. They said it was our breaker. We had an electrician come out and basically pain him to tell us nothing was wrong and they must have hooked the dryer up incorrectly. Called them back to get someone out, they were supposed to come yesterday and canceled on us, and no showed on us today. We paid a ridiculous amount of money to have a washer and dryer just sitting in our house. They have beyond wasted our time. This is literally only the tip of the iceberg of our experience and doesn't even cover the times we have called and not gotten called back and the fact that when you do call they answer the phone as if it's their house phone. Seriously annoyed and will never buy anything from lowes again."

0,"This one one of the single worst experiences in a salon in my LIFE !!!\nthis place came highly recommended to me from a friend.. i didn't act on the recommendation for awhile, however the last time we went there we encountered a short fat girl/ stylist named Emily. her general disposition towards me and the other guests was rude and mean and her whinny voice was utterly annoying.  I was unfortunate enough to sit in her chair.  the floor wasn't even swept first!  her scissors had hair on them from the last guest.. the station had hair all over it im  sure she first reached for a dirty comb before i stopped her.\nshe proceed to wet my long hair with a water bottle, then when i stopped her and asked for a shampoo she rudely responded \""That's $4.00 more.\""  i agreed to pay and i got the quickest roughest shampoo of my life and it really hurt my neck too...\nshe gave me the worst haircut ever.. a monkey with a blindfold could have done a nicer job.  at least that would have been an enjoyable experience.. and worth the $12.00!"
1,"I have been to a lot of all you can eat  sushi places, and this one is at the bottom of my list. I am glad i did not get their all you can eat because the sushi was not that good at all. Overall... i was not impressed and probably won't make the drive all the way out there again."
2,"It's a new Dutch Brothers coffee, I know it has been open for several months I've just been really family the drive-through is really tight and narrow drive, not good if you  have a big vehicle and you could go to $.99 store sprouts and Burger King all in the same parking lot"
3,"Not sure why I haven't reviewed this but, it seems like every time I stop in Vegas I need to make a stop here. Not much of a secret anymore to me. It's stuck between another restaurant and an Elevator that doesn't seem to work sometimes. There's a pool table right in front so if you spot the pool table you know you are close. \n\nThe pizzas are pretty damn good. You have to go with the White Pie, they sometimes hide it under the table only because they have a lot of pizzas out already on display. But if you ask if they have some they usually do. And of not, it doesn't hurt to wait. I usually add a lot of mushrooms and sausages to mine. The thin crust is good as well as the thick crust. Honestly you can't go wrong with either or. \n\nIf you are looking to get down with some pizza than come to this place. Just make sure you don't gamble all your money away or spend too much money on drinks the night before (or maybe even the night of haha)."
0,VERY LOUD MUSIC during busy hours. Can't eat if plugging ears. Our table couldn't hear each other talk so decided to write reviews instead.\n\nNormally it's alright. Food only worth the price during late night half price.
2,"Courteous Staff, Friendly Service, Comfortable ambience, Delicious Food!"
2,"The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is super clean. \n\nAlthough the portions are way too small compared to the price. \n\nI'm not sure if it's the standard, or the fact that it's in Old Town Scottsdale"
3,Great nails place in Old Town.  Teres offers reasonable prices for their mani/pedis.  Everyone can customize their visit at Teres.  They have  different infused soaks guests can select from.  The staff is very knowledgeable about their nails and always offer suggestions for designs.  At Teres they offer a dry manicure.  It was the best manicure I have ever had.  I love that they keep your information in a database and remember the services you had from previous visits.  You can purchase a a membership or you can pay per visit.  I am so glad Old Town has a fantastic nail bar that won't put a dent in your pocket.
1,"We were in Las Vegas last week and went to Fatburger 2 separate times.  On the 1st visit we had a burger and fries. While both were good, they really were nothing special. If anything the meat was slightly on the dry side.\nOn our last morning is Vegas we went for breakfast. I had eggs potatoes and toast.  The eggs were very much undercooked, barely enough to not turn them back in.\nPotatoes were very good."
2,"We went in here to grab some beers & kill some time during a weekday afternoon.  The screens were playing blurry VH1 rock videos from the 80s & the place was dead besides a couple of guys wearing NASCAR jackets sitting at the bar.  I'm guessing it reels in plenty of tourist considering who the owner is.  I was in the mood for a nice cold beer & asked the bartender what were my options?  It was very limited.  I asked her what the house blend or whatever they call it was on tap.  She informed me it was similar to Coors.  Wow...I hadn't had a beer that watery since high school.  I ordered one Stella, drank it swiftly & was on my way. \n\nI won't be coming back to sample their ales.  I'd be curious to see a live show there sometime...or maybe not?  I'm sure it's better at night on the weekend.  Again...this review was mid-day mid-week.  They do need to get some some craft beers in there though.  2.5 stars is more accurate for my experience, but my experience was swift & limited to a single beer."
0,"High priced DOG food. The boneless chicken wings were barely edible and made my stomach gargle for hours. This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees. Management: Stop offering discount wings during happy hour, your staff gets rude to people who order them because they believe they aren't going to get a descent tip, your not helping yourself."
2,"Die Kombe ist ein ziemlich kontroverser Laden. Auf der einen Seite geht man gerne hin, da es einer der letzten wirklichen Rock/Metal Clubs in Karlsruhe ist.

4,"Stopped in for lunch after yelp search nearby. Very impressed. Everything was so fresh. Four of us ate. 1 had shrimp salad. Perfect. One had meatball sub. Perfect. One had antipasta. Perfect. One had egg drop spinach soup. Amazing!\n\nGreat service, nice people. Will be back for sure."
4,"For quite a while now I've driven past a residential building in Old Town Scottsdale, at the base of which is an unassuming red and white sign that reads \""POSH Improvisational Cuisine.\""  After having asked several friends what this place was all about and gathering random bits of information about this mysterious restaurant that \""has no menu,\"" \""is really expensive,' and my personal favorite \""I have no freaking idea,\"" I added it to my list of places I wanted to try out.\n\nRecently I had the opportunity to meet several friends for dinner and POSH was the consensus restaurant choice, so to POSH I went!  Arriving First in my group is unusual for me but arrive first I did.  The \""lobby\"" in POSH is well..POSH, with several comfy chairs and a view of what's going on in the restaurant.\n\nAfter a few minutes my group arrived and we were shown to our preferred counter seats (the better to see Chef  Joshua Hebert create our dinner), brought cocktails and given the rundown on how things worked.  Presented with sushi style menus, we were instructed to strike through any proteins that we didn't like and note at the bottom any allergies or things we didn't prefer to eat. That was it, a menu would be created individually for each diner in the party by the Chef and his crew of culinary mad scientists.\n\nI ordered the six course tasting menu sans wine pairing for $65, and wondered what gastronomical delights awaited.   My wait was not long as the amuse bouche arrived in short order.  After a few minutes our first course arrived,  potato viscosuisse with chive oil & arugula pesto, a surprisingly lite, chilled soup with a silky texture that begs to be consumed.\n\nAll conversation stopped as the members of my party hungrily consumed a variety of tailor made dishes and just as suddenly resumed amidst a chorus of \""oooh's,' and \""ahhh's,\"" while we discussed the day's events and waited for the next course which in my case was an Heirloom yellow tomato sorbet, sweetened with a little bit of simple syrup, mint oil & tomato caviar garnish. I must say, I never knew tomatoes could taste so exquisite.  The flavor was bright, sweet and fresh with just a hint of acidity and was topped with tiny red tomato caviar which burst on the palate providing just the slightest bit of sourness.\n\nOn to the next course of Santa Barbara spot prawns served with a shrimp demi-glace, preserved lemon, capers & baby artichokes. Now I've eaten a lot of shrimp in my time and more than my fair share of prawns yet I've never had them cooked so perfectly.  The temperature was spot on making them succulent and moist , the rich and flavorful demi-glace tasted faintly of the ocean and combined with salty capers had me envisioning waves of flavor washing over my palate.\n\nWhile awaiting the next course we discussed the different experiences each member of the group had had to this point. There was general agreement that there were flavors, textures and presentation elements that we hadn't had previously and all were eager to move on to the next course which was Fois gras.\n\nI've always heard people waxing poetic about the virtues of foie gras and have generally been ambivalent but no more, the crunchy brulee' was the perfect textural compliment to soft, slightly sweet foie gras (the texture and flavor of which I'm STILL at a loss to adequately describe), served over a sweet coulis of papaya with tiny house pickled grapes and topped with a beautiful garnish of hand spun sugar.  I've thought about this dish many times over the last few days but the only thing I'm able to say is that you must try it!\n\nMy next course was lamb which I normally find improperly prepared leaving it with an unpleasant taste and texture but masterfully prepared here.  Served with broccoli, fingerling potatoes & a mustard dill sauce with Chile flakes.  Unfortunately, I wolfed it down so fast that I forgot to take pictures.  I will say that having lamb prepared in this way gives me cause to add it to my list of \""likes!\""\n\nThe next course happened to be duck, another protein that I typically dislike due to poor preparation which leaves it greasy with an unpleasant flavor.  Here the duck was bacon cured served with bok choy & apricot sake sauce. This dish was both visually appealing and absolutely delicious (I've said this about several of the night's items with good reason), it was perfectly prepared, tender enough to cut with a fork, with just the right amount of salty smokiness which went well when paired with the accompanying apricot sake sauce.\n\nFollowing the duck was a surprise course of Scrapple (a Pennsylvania Dutch favorite), served with Fava beans and the Boar bacon that I've heard so much about. This crunchy on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside staple of the Pennsylvania working man was elevated by Chef  Joshua Hebert, to something extraordinary.  Topped with a crispy poached egg yolk, crunchy boar bacon bits and bright, fresh Fava beans, scrapple at POSH is one of my new favorite thing."

0,"I posted this review on this business's facebook page but they deleted the entire page after they seen it so I guess that tells you what kind of person this salon owner is. I would not recommend this salon to anyone. I have never been here and I WILL NEVER go after I found out how they treat their employees. My sister is 19 and fresh out of cosmetology school and this owner Jennifer took advantage of her. My sister drove up to Fitchburg from Janesville for an interview then the owner requested she come back with 2 people to cut their hair and show her skills after that she was hired at the salon. My sister did not have her license yet as she still had to take the 2 tests before she was officially a cosmetologist so she was hired to do training at the time. She clocked in and she clocked out at the end of the day. She worked a total of 11 hours before she realized this Salon was not the one for her. So she let the owner know she would be quitting and the owner was ok with that however the owner stated she could not work at any salons within a certain mile radious of this one per some contract that my sister signed. My sister has been trying to get a copy of this contract ever since however the owner refuses to give her a copy. Then to make matters worse this owner is now refusing to pay my sister for the 11 hours she worked. She is now saying the contract is void because she doesn't want to pay my sister. She is stating my sister was just shadowing for her which is a complete and utter lie. You do not clock in and clock out unless you are being paid for the work you are doing. I can not believe that you would refuse to pay a young girl for her work. She worked for those 11 hours and you need to pay her. The BBB will be contacted, you can not just NOT pay an employee.  You should be ashamed of your self for trying to get one over on a teenager. Where are your morals!"
1,"Cars in the shop, so discovering local cheap delivery joints. \n\nFirst off, I have to subtract stars for charging $3.50 \""delivery fee\"" That money should be the tip that goes to the driver, and is just a dishonorable way of sneaking extra cash into the bill.\n\nThe food.., xl=18\"" w 3 toppings and parm bread sticks (pizza crust with parm cheese on it,)\nFor $15 w/coupon it was what I expected, although the people seem nice, delivery fast, modest amount of cheese on the pizza, reasonable everything else except one of my toppings was onions and I can tell you that was a waste!  Which is stupid, its the cheapest topping I requested! load it up a little, sheesh.\nThe second time we ordered I asked if I could pay a buck and get some cheese on the cheese sticks, they said sure and while it didn't make it good, it made it better.\n\nI respect them trying to service at a low price point, and yes, I've had worse, it's delivered fast fresh and friendly, which means a lot.\n\nBut that delivery charge (which I know was started by a chain) is just so maddening, and an insult to the drivers."
1,"The first time we ordered from here, we were actually impressed with the pizza (being from NY....) The second time was also pretty good. \nEach and every time after that it's been AWFUL!! I don't know what happened, did they change cooks?, or maybe we were just so pizza deprived that anything tasted good to us...... who knows! I will say though, they have an excellent chicken parm hero (or \""sandwich\"", as they call them)."
4,I have never had a thing here that wasn't amazing. The wait for your food is totally worth it and acceptable with their quality.
1,"I feel sorta bad for Hendersonians.  They have Weiss, Summerlin has Bagel Cafe as the resident Jewish deli.\n\nFor the record, Bagel Cafe destroys Weiss.\n\nI've tried the baked goods and the deli food.  The hamantaschen, rugelach, and black & white cookies at Weiss are not very good. The filling in both the hamantaschen and rugelach seemed to rely more on a gel-like substance than fruit.  The cookies, a little stale.  Passable, but not something I would buy again. \n\nThe matzoh balls here also taste a little off...I really can't explain it. Rubbery?\n \nTheir corned beef, however, is decent as are the bagels.   But, Jewish deli is serious business.  Weiss just doesn't pull it off successfully."
2,"I love Sundance and I am a regular -- but 4 stars for the declining quality of the  film selection-- WHen Sundance first opened  you were assured independent movies and interesting docs.    docs     Now, I am noticing  more and more mainstream blockbusters.   ( also playing up the road)  so there is really zero difference.    And you can buy food at most theaters now. \n\n\n\n    I am disgusted sitting next to a pizza chomping slob."
4,"I know Linda and I know this shop. It is a shame that a disgruntled employee can go on this tirade and try to ruin the reputation of this shop. The shop is always clean and the products they use have a long history of excellence in the grooming industry NATIONWIDE. Look at reviews prior to the reviews of the fired manager and you will see a much more accurate assessment of this business. Social media is a nice way to find out how other people feel about a business you might like to frequent, but when fired ex-employees with a vendetta have a chance to harm honest and hard working businesses, take what they say with an enormous grain of salt."
1,"I like the hole-in-the-wall bar feel, but this place was a little too intense for me.  Plus, it's not in the greatest of neighborhoods.  Honestly, I would recommend going somewhere else."
1,"Grimaldi's is an establishment with a large pedigree. One of the most lauded pizza joints in New York City, they appeared to have branched out - franchising 2 joints in Las Vegas\n\nSo, after much anticipation, my hubby and I bit the bullet and went for a piece of pie.\n\nMeh. Really. The pizza was not as flavourful as what we expected. We had the marinara (tinned, pureed tomatoes) sauce with sausage, basil and onions. The lack of spice of the sauce and the sausage was  a total downer. The small amount of basil they did put on the pizza did nothing to detract from the overall blandness of the poor pie. Which was rather sad because the crust is one of the best we've tried.\n\nWe did go back to try Grimaldi's a second time - this time opting for a \""white\"" sauce with meatball and onions. Still, the food was rather bland. Our server this time did bring us some dried oregano and garlic powder which we doused the poor slices with to give it some flavour.\n\nReally, for the food alone, it does probably deserve maybe a three star rating. However the cost of the pizza detracted me from doing so."
1,"Golf courses in the summer time in arizona are a bit tough to grade because of the severe water restrictions most courses have in place. Most really nice ones take a step back in terms of course conditions while the ones that are affordable during the peak part of the season can be barely playable during the dog days of summer. Southern Ridge Golf course or as it was formerly known as Bougainvilla is unfortunately on the latter side. The value is here (I think we paid 15 a person on GolfNow) but Its hardly worth it. Aside from a few lush patches of fairway there is alot of hard dirt and gravel all waiting to greet you if hit one off the fairway or in a \""sand\"" trap. We played in the heart of the summer and course conditions aside the layout is a bit of a head scratcher. It seemed like the par 3's were a bit lengthy yet the 4's and 5's werent all that long or challenging. Oh and not to mention a nice long par 3 to start off the back 9. Huh? If you have to play a course in this area try Vistal or Aguila, both slightly more expensive but definitely worth it."
0,"I cannnot believe the quality of food at this restaurant.  How it survives in Las Vegas, the food capital of the world, is beyond me.  The hamburger I ordered was just a single, and thank God, I didn't order anything bigger.  The single patty had 4 pieces of grizzle in it.  It was dried out, like it was yesterday's leftover!  They don't serve anything but alcoholic drinks and Coke and bottled water.  My husband ordered fries with his burger and they were floating in grease.  This place is no joke, if you eat the fries, you can have a coronary!  I've eaten in many restaurants in Vegas, and this has to be the worst, and it is a tourist trap.  Stay away!"
4,"I like the Southern California atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and \""waited\"" on us despite the \""order, and take a number\"" style establishment.  All in all it was a good experience, but I wanted the tacos to taste better.  I'm going to give this place another try so I can hopefully bump the rating to four stars.\n\n5/28/13-  I gave this place another try and I am so glad I did.  I had one of the better tasting chicken burritos I have ever had.  I had to bump up the rating from three stars to five because it was so delicious.  The staff was friendly again.  I really hope this business does well enough for a few more locations in the valley."
0,"The worst ever,I no kidding the worst customer service ever and only about half the time is pizza up to papa johns standard .why corporate has  not  for stepped in to totally clean house is amazing,years ago I quit calling them because they would instantly ask you to hold no matter what time of day you called them, not ever minute of day are they that busy,couple of years go by and  i thought  maybe corporate  came in  replaced the entire staff due to all the negative reviews on yelp and I do. Love papa johns pizza when it's done right so I thought I would give them a second chance since I was going to next closes papa  johns for years on boulder highway, so call in a  order using a coupon issued thru a flyer that states its for carry out only but not an online since some of the coupons do state online only but not this one which I had to argue with the call taker then he said he did not recognize the promo code at all,asked to speak with the manager he was the manager, great job job of corporate over sight guys.this one store could run the whole franchise into the ground."
2,"Mediocre.  I had the chicken tacos.  They were pretty bland; the chicken didn't have much flavor.  My mojito was great, though.  (Thank goodness--it cost $12!)  My cousin slipped the hostess $20 to get us seated quickly.  I was kind of disgusted that they took the bribe, but happy not to have to wait too long!"
3,awesome job for my son's cup cakes
2,"I was here for lunch last week with Rand H. Robyn N. and Mike C.  The food was fine.  They offered several good shrimp dishes.  Pinapple Shrimp, Shrimp with vegetables, Shrimp with corn, and fried shrimp to name a few.  They were all good.  Fried rice was tasty too.  The service was fast with refils on drinks.  I was not too impressed with the entrance though.  There is a big crack in the tile at the entrance which looks tacky in my opinion.  But then again, this is a chinese buffet so......\nAll in all not the best I've had but A-OK."
3,"Not sure what I can really say about a grocery store. This one is bigger than the average store. Cool, all the better."
2,"I am heartbroken . . . .Dan the MAN is no longer with the Concourse.\nI heard from some colleagues that the current employees are not allowed to discuss the matter.  BOOOOOOOO.  Deduct 1 star.  I would deduct more, but after staying at the other hotels in the area, this is still the most lively/full-service hotel in Madison.\n\nI am going to miss Dan =("
2,"the full veg menu is pretty cool. its a little on the pricey side but the rolls are decent enough sized (on average about 10 a roll). the customer service is stellar and its low key. it makes for a nice 'once and while\"" place but only because of the price. \n\nmy extremely picky family will eat here. so that kind of a big deal."
3,"Arrived for dinner a little after 6:30pm on a Wednesday evening with 3 of my colleagues. Travelled with someone who cannot eat alot due medical reasons. With propoer identification cards, they were able to accomodate them with a child rate. We were seated almost immediately as there was no line. Had about 4 helpings. Left about 3 hours later. \n\nAmbience was good. Food was on the better side of good, but not great. Good enough to justify its price tag(38+ for dinner)."
0,"I came to the grand cafe a few months ago with my boyfriend. We had horrible service and disappointing food. We made a complaint that night. We finally got a call back about it yesterday. The manager offered to 'take care of us' the next time we come in. So we went today. The manager met us at the host desk, shook our hands and led us to our table. I was confused, was it a free meal? discounted? I had no idea. I got a burger and my bf had a steak dinner. The food was much better than last time but nothing to get excited about. The service was better too. But the waitress never said 'you're welcome' after I thanked her for refilling drinks.  It's a pet peeve. then the check came and my bf said 'the manager will take care of it' she seemed to know the situation and took the check away. We continued to sit at the table waiting for the manager to come by and discuss the bill or at least say something. But he never came by. So we started to leave. As we were walking out, the manager stopped us, shook our hands and said have a nice day. that was it. He was not rude but the whole thing was confusing and awkward."
1,It was good! But the wonton ooOomg there was nothing inside and I called the restaurant and the lady said there was only Tiiiiiiiny tiny bits of chicken! LOL Wich is a lie cos there was none!!! \nWhy Lie?
1,"***Monday Lunch review***\nNo crabs, no prime rib... not even cocktail shrimps...\n\nOur last day in Vegas so decided to try Wynn.  The hotel itself was beautiful and the buffet was decorated so beautifully it was pretty amazing.  Now, the food.  Aside from the disappointment of no crabs and prime ribs...the selection of food was just not there...  I mean it was so sad that my husband had a slice of marinated Kobe beef and couscous...  Dessert selection was small but good.  I liked the mojito cake.   \n\n* Ambiance = VERY beautiful...I mean it is one of the best decorated buffets we've seen before.\n\n* Service = bad.  Had to ask for everything...\n\n* Price = expensive for the selections offered.  We paid $24/person."
1,"One of the few times Yelp steered me in the wrong direction.  Not sure how my experience differed so much from everyone else's but... it did.  I dropped my bichon off this morning for a groom and temperament evaluation.  Picked him up a little bit ago and after getting home I see that three of his nails were trimmed so short that he had clearly been bleeding.  Ouch.  Poor little guy!  That is NOT what I expect from a professional groomer - that's what I expect when I do it myself - that's why I take him to the pros!  They claim to have done an evaluation of his temperament but clearly had not - the dog they described was not how my dog acts around other dogs - unless, I guess, they did it after they hurt him while trimming his nails.  We won't be back."
0,"Dear HiFi, \n\nYou have a phone stealer.  Take care of that.\n\nThank you, \nOlivia\n\nReference: my phone, my friend's phone, my other friend's phone all with in 10 minutes"
4,This place is awesome food here is excellent. I would really recommend getting the ribs they are so good. They fall right off the bone yet still retains a nice bite that you would want to get from a good piece of meat. Their sides are also really good the cheesy mac is super creamy and cheesy. \n\nThe prices here are also pretty good. I would not consider it cheap but its a good value for the quality and amount of food you get. \n\nService here is really good too. Everybody is really nice and helpful. Sometimes when it gets really busy it gets a little chaotic due to the tight space they have but you can still tell everybody there is giving it their all to try and provide the best service they can.
4,"I wish it was my anniversary everyday. \n\nMy boyfriend and I visited Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate our two year anniversary. His sister-in-law used to continually rave about this place and after months of waiting, we decided that our anniversary would the perfect date. \n\nI don't know why but for some reason, we decided not to make reservations. Foolish, foolish idea. You most definitely should make a reservation. We waited for about 40 minutes and finally got seated in a table made for two. Seeing that my boyfriend is a 6'2\"", 200lb man, let's just say that the table was just a bit on the tiny side.\n\nWe were greeted by a curly haired waitress-- she was terrific! She first started us off with some bread and butter to accompany my glass of Merlot and my boyfriend's glass of Cotes du Rhone. I know that he enjoyed his wine but it definitely didn't compare to the most smooth and soft bodied Merlot I have ever tasted. Mmmm, soooo good!\n\nWe went on to order the warm brie cheese as our appetizer. Oh this is so very, very good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but I decided to order this for my cheese-loving man. Good thing because I couldn't stop my hands from reaching for the platter! The croutons gave such a nice crunch and the slightest bit of saltiness to contrast the soft and gooey, sweet honey-covered cheese. I swear I think this is the only appetizer we'll ever order here!\n\nFor the main, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon au poivre and I ordered the filet mignon merlot. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection, juicy and well seasoned. However, we both agreed that t the end of the day, mine was much more flavorful due to the merlot reduction. Either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and it went well with our steak, although it had too much black pepper for our taste.\n\nWith the help of many hours of Masterchef Australia, I became familiar with different types of french desserts and was extremely excited to order profiteroles... until I saw the chocolate fudge cake with homemade caramel ice cream, that is. We ended up ordering the chocolate cake which was beyond incredible. Then, our kick ass waitress sensed much hesitation from me and brought out some profiteroles--on the house! Score! :D Needless to say, it was phenomenal. \n\nObviously, my overall experience was absolutely superb, and I definitely recommend this place for people who are celebrating a wonderful occasion. Just brace yourself- you're gonna want some more real soon!"
4,cool stuff
4,"Our doggy Hercules thanks Luxe Pet Hotels for the care and excellent service!\n\nThe facilities are nice, staff considerate... Wouldn't hesitate to bring our dog here next time."
0,Besides the meatball the food was not good.  Had the veal piccotta which was drowned in sauce and the mash potatoes were out of a box!!!
2,"MGM Grand Buffet offers a variety of food for an okay price. It would honestly be better to come spend a tad bit more money at Wynn Buffet for more variety and better tasting food.\n\nThis buffet usually has a very short wait time of about 10-15 minutes. The decor isn't much, just casual and is dark. The service isn't that great either, they just get the job done and do not usually make eye-contact or smile. \n\nThe food here is alright, just mild and decent. There was nothing that I really remembered other than dessert. All I remembered having was a rich dark chocolate mousse that was quite good. Other than that, the food was decent. There is not much variety compared to Wynn Buffet and the prices are extremely similar."
3,This is my wife's favorite place to eat and it is very affordable for a great experience. The place seems to be very high class and the food is good. I only wished they would bring back their Venetian Chicken. The reason it is 4 stars is because I think they always include the tip in the bill so there is no reason to put cash or write it in on the receipt because they include it already and you might end up double tipping. Seems sneaky and I am a firm believer of allowing the customer to tip themselves or that is like false advertisement or theft...
4,"Newer location. Service was prompt and courteous -- I was also the only person on a Monday about an hour before close. \nMost importantly, ordered Banh Mi burger and sweet potato fries. Both were amazing. Burger came with Nuoc Mam sauce good enough to drink."
0,"Over priced and below average food. There are better Indian restaurants in Tempe. Mango lassi that we ordered was salty and watery, it was the weirdest mango lassi that I've had so far. The other dishes that we ordered were chicken tikka masala, malai kofta and chilly pakora. The chilli pakoras were soggy and not crisp at all and the other two were average.\n All and all I would give this place a miss for the next time."
3,"I have worked near this place for 8 years now. I have eaten at every single lunch food place surrounding this office at least once. My favorite is Ichi Ban.  I just can't afford it as often as I want.\n\nI have also eaten sushi at several valley locations and I return to Ichi Ban every time. Why? Becuase they make the rolls very tight. The rice is perfect and the flavor is fresh. I can't stand it when rolls are sloppy and the rice falls apart or the fish slides right off. The portions of fish per piece is just right and the flavors blend so nicely. The presentations look good, especially that Dec. 29th roll. I have never had the fish smell I've encountered in other joints. Even the octopus is fresh and the wasabi is hot. \n\nTheir tempura is perfect, the gyoza make it possible to bring my child who isn't as adventurous. I have never gotten sick there. I have frequently gotten full. I agree they are too attentive on the drink orders and seem to be in a hurry to take away your miso bowl, which is partly why they lose a star. Let a person eat!  The other reason was when I ordered my daughter some lemonade I got Endamame. I realize they may sound similar, but it was a drink order. They had good endamame though so I was ok. The third reason is that they close between late lunch and early dinner and it makes it less likely for me to go across the street to eat for dinner when I have to wait an hour.\n\nWhen I first visited the place was so dark and narrow, but I liked sitting up at the sushi bar and the owner remembers you. Well he always remembers me and even what we like and asks about my daughter when we don't bring her. I don't like their green tea ice cream, it tastes like what I expect Cyndi Lauper's lipstick might taste like. Maybe it's supposed to taste that way and I don't like anyone's green tea ice cream. I haven't tried others since that experience. I'd rather spend my money on another roll. I have tried to get my co-workers to come over, but no one I work with cares for sushi. I told them they could get a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken or something, but they pass. Maybe they don't want to go to lunch with me... hmm. \n\nMy partner told me that not all Ichi Ban's are created equal. I'm just lucky this one is so close.  I just wish I could afford more of it. I'd eat there every day."
2,"Frequent shopper of the Summerlin locations when I lived in that area. Recently moved back to Henderson and needed to find my Dollar General fix. This was the closest location to me so I stopped in for a shop.\n\nFirst off, the area was like..........I walked inside and was not impressed at first glance. I have to deprogram my Summerlin mind. But, I have to admit that once I started cruising the aisles, it felt like I was in my old store. All the same items at the same great prices that I'm used to, so I was a happy camper. This place is the best for getting great name brand and off brand products for a great price. \n\nNeedless to say that I will be back to this location again and again and again. Absolutely love this store and the employees are very friendly. I would ditch it, however, if a closer location becomes available in Henderson."
2,"This is a medium size grocery store.  I visit this store for vitamins and herbs that I can't find in the WF or F&E that I pass on the way to this store.  They carry some herbal things for kids in Sprouts like kick-it Immune.  I definitely like this store for those things and I will continue to go here.\n\nI'm not a fan of the layout of this store.  It oddly has row of shelves that are  parallel to the front door.  That is odd for a grocery store of this size.  It does have the things I buy the most along the perimeter of the store.\n\nI'm not very impressed with the service in Sprouts stores in general.  Not like you find in WF or F&E.  All in all, I will return."
0,"Thought they were the most flavorless and driest cupcakes I have ever tried. The frosting was the only decent part. Based on other reviews maybe I had a bad batch, but they should check them. Either way I will never go there again."
0,We were told to go to a local store to upgrade some equipment we had ordered online that was missing the power cord. The shipment originally came from Oregano. We were told by the manager in Oregano that they would give an upgrade or 50% off something as long as it wasn't already on sale. We spoke the salesman and the manager and told them what happened and waited for 2 hours just to find out they never called the store to verify. We finally asked for the manager AGAIN who acted like it was our responsibility to call them and hand them the phone...I swear ever time we come here the service is terrible. They act like why are you here. Just not a good vibe at all. I only keep coming back with my friend who apparently doesn't mind the terrible service. BUT since now I have been here over 2 hours I had to say what I see....
0,"This place is a joke!! ATE there once and got some ribs, i gave them to the dog because they tasted like dog bones!!! Went back several months later with my girlfriend again!! because she wanted to try it out and it was the same, horrible place, bad food!!! don't bother going there!!"
2,"I think I need to come back here and try more things, but for their signature item - arepas - it is a-ok.\n\nRight off the bat, I thought of In-n-Out for presentation. Flavor-wise, I think this is ironically where it fell on its face a bit. I had both the beef and chicken arepas, no cheese. Lots of cilantro mayo and hot green sauce. The chicken was dry. The beef was MOSTLY fat. I probably just got unlucky here. I ate maybe 20% of it before I put it down pre-cardiac arrest. I do like the corn dough/arepas. Definitely has a pleasant flavor. But hey, what doesn't after it's fried?\n\nLike I said, I should probably come back and try their garlic shrimp and maybe an empanada. Until then, this is definitely worth trying but keep some modest expectations."
0,"This place continues to get worse, I don't even know where to start. I literally woke up at 3am Bc of screaming kids at the pool- do I have the energy to get up and complain? Yes! Do I? No! Why? Every other time it took at least an hour for it to stop, I'm assuming it wasn't even the security; rather it was the party animals probably just calling it a night."
4,I love piece box! Have lived about 3mins up the road for 2 years & never popped in!!! how gutted am I! Lovely d\u00e9cor in this place... somewhere you could sit & wind away a few hours with a good pal easily. The menu is pretty extensive... nice & creative but makes it hard to pick because it all looks so nice. The cakes are all sitting out as well... does not do good for the waistline! But they are fantastic.\nPrices are pretty average... 10% student discount which is good. The food is worth the price due to quality & huge portions. \nOnly minor bad point is they don't serve breakfast items all day (pancakes at any time of day is good!) please change this as everytime I am in I want to try them but I am always in too late!\nBad reviews on here count for nothing when you see people queuing up to come in on a sunday! That says it all!
3,I've been to two events that had box lunches from Saddlecreek and each time was delicious. It's about as good as a business box lunch gets. The sandwiches are made with the most wonderful bread from a local bakery and the chocolate cookies are awesome.\n\nI've had their fruit bread too at a conference and it was wonderful. I've heard they sell out of pastries every day. I wish they were able to bring more of their baked goods.
4,"I've hired ABC for many projects I've needed for my properties in Arizona and he has not only been fair in his fees but I feel I can trust him to take care of my needs.  He always calls me to keep me informed even when I don't live in the area.  I just can't understand the people who gave him 1 star reviews as he has always been very responsive to my calls and communicated to me what he was doing.  I guess I'm lucky  that I've not had even close to the experience of Yanira, DJ, or Mikd.\nRecommend Highly!!!"
0,"This place sucks.  Just got back from lunch after trying it for the first time.  I wanted a pita and greek fries and when I placed my order, the guy charged me for a combo and mumbled a number.  When my order came up, I pointed out to the stupid b*ch giving me my food that I ordered greek fries and she looked at the ticket and said \""well, you paid for a combo, that comes with regular fries\"" and then she shoved the order at me and walked away.  Needless to say, I won't be going back!"
1,"We decided to start our wedding band search for both Kevin and me and this was the first jeweler we stopped at.  Gary approached us asking what we were looking for, and I told him both rings.  He showed me a few of the rings that might look good with my ring, and there was one that I liked.  He asked if he could write it up for puchase, I said no, we were just starting our search and wanted to see what was out there.  We then asked him about the men's rings, and pointed us over to men's, not showing us or giving us information on rings.  So we were back on our own.\n\nWe spent a few moments looking at the men's wedding bands when we were approached by another sales person, but we turned them away just saying we were looking.  Shortly after, another lady comes over.  Kevin didn't want the help, but I asked her anyways.  Amber was a huge delight.  She showed us the different kinds of rings and tolds us the different information on the rings.  She asked us if we wanted her to write down the information on a card so we would know which ones we were interested in.  She even went back to mine to write that down, and showed me another ring she thought would match, and it did, better than the one Gary showed us!  She was happy to help us and very friendly, even though we were just looking.  She was really the one that helped us moving forward and knowing what we wanted to look for at all the other stores.\n\nOne star for Gary and five for Amber.  We are not going to go back to purchase because we found ones that we loved more at another store and that were more for our budget."
3,"The lunch special (available until 2pm) is a nice amount of food for the money and is very tasty.  Having said that, we aren't so sure that the owners are all that fond of their patrons.  Sometimes it can feel as if they are annoyed that you showed up!  Or maybe that's just the hawaiian way? ;) We're also not too sure how sanitary it is to be preparing food, chopping vegetables and the like in the dining room where customers are?  We suppose, as long as they keep serving up the tasty bbq chicken, and we don't get sick, we'll keep going back!"
4,"What an interesting place!  The feel of the restaurant is young and hip and the vibrant green of the decor makes the place feel fun and eclectic.  This is my first time here even though I often go next door and hit up Starbucks.  The menu is rather large and it will take you minute to read everything over.  They are gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, and low-carb friendly place that offers a nice selection of soups, salads, burgers, 9\"" pizzas, smoothies, sandwiches/wraps and a choice to even create your own meal.  After pondering what to eat I decided on a burger.  What is more classic than a burger and if they could make it right then I would be encouraged to try more off the menu. \n\nI ordered the buffalo burger done to a medium (they also have ostrich which I have never had) and tofu fries.  There is also an option for the jicama fries.  I was told the jicama fries are fry-shaped pieces of jicama tossed in a dressing.  I shied away from the jicama because I have not had it before personally but I did hear they are good.  The tofu fries are firm tofu tossed in rice flow and fried.  They are delicious!  The burger can come on a wheat or gluten-free bun or as a wrap. I chose the wheat bun and got Swiss cheese on my burger.  The burger itself is massive stacked with a thick patty, lettuce, tomato and onion!  I can barely fit it in my mouth!  The bread to meat ratio for the burger is perfect.  I took a bite and the burger is done exactly right (medium), juicy and tender.  \n\nFor my buffalo burger, tofu fries, pickle and a soda cost me a little over $14 including tax.  A good price for a nice buffalo burger.  Also their soda machine dispenses small ice pellets.  This is an important point to make for my fellow ice munchers! \n\nThe place is WiFi ready but you will have to ask for the passkey to access the network. When I asked the staff about power access they did not know but I was able to speak to Jeff, one of the owners, and he was able to show me where to plug in.  For those needing a place to work there are a TON of plugs (long power strips) under the bench along the back wall of the restaurant. Just a little looking and you will see them.       \n\nIf you are looking for a nice place to grab a healthy bite to eat (even with your GF, Vegan or Uber-health conscious friends)  then look no further than the Greens and Proteins!"
0,"Sad attempt at a breakfast.. They got off to a good start with nicely baked muffins, but blew it up with re-heated potatoes, and microwaved eggs.. \nI do not recommend, unless you plan to have lots of cocktails before your food arrives."
3,"We ordered the antipasti with roasted vegies and chicken liver patte. It was fantastic. Our margherita pizza was good, not great. Pizza crust is delicious. Our service was great. It seemed the staff tried hard to give great service. Will come back for sure will try other items on the menu."
3,Low prices and great food. Fast service.... definitely one of my favorite places! AMAZING selection of indie sodas!
0,"I had been to Calico Jacks several times for the Karaoke. I have a blast each and every time I go. So I figured I better give the restaurant a try. The restaurant has an old west style to it. It isn't super fancy by any means, but it is O.K. After I seated myself I was quickly assisted. My waitperson was also the bartender. So it was amazing how fast she came to help me. She was very kind and friendly. I ordered a salad to start and it came out quickly. There was nothing special about the salad. But it wasn't bad either. Just a nondescript salad. For my main course I ordered their ribs with a side of fries and corn. I started with the corn. It was a quarter ear and it was steaming on the plate. I buttered and salted it and picked it up to eat. My first few bite were very good. But when I rotated the ear to eat more the rest of the ear was cold. The taste was still good, but I expect to at least get a warm ear of corn. One of the rows was almost cold enough to still be considered frozen.\n\nThen I started on the fries and ribs. The fries were O.K. They were beer battered. The beer batter had no flavor to it at all. It just gave the fries an extra crunch to them. All-in-all not worth the extra calories. The fries were just fries. The taste was alright but there was no zing to them. The best part of the meal was the ribs. They were very tender and had a lot of flavor. The only thing you need to watch out for is the B.B.Q. Sauce. It is slathered on so thick there is just as much of it as the ribs. The taste of the sauce was very good. You could taste the combination of the tomatoes, brown sugar, and vinegar for acidity. It was a good combination, just way to thick.\n\nTo wash everything down I had an Iced Tea. I'm not sure of the brand, but it had a good tea flavor like a good tea. I am very glad I did have something to wash everything down. This was not the most pleasant meal I have ever had, but it sure was not the worst. I did get good service, but I think I will stick to the Karaoke next time. I think you should do the same."
2,"It has been almost a year-and-a half since our last visit to this Cajun/Creole restaurant.  We received a basket of warm and crunchy hush puppies to start with that I cranked up with a liberal douse of hot sauce.  Ann chose the (frozen) crawfish etouffee served with Cajun rice. My entr\u00e9e was catfish and shrimp Creole over rice with mixed vegetables. My dish included 4 pieces of blackened catfish and a similar number of medium shrimp.  Overall, both meals were above average"
1,"This is tough to give 2 stars to. I honestly think that if it wasn't so outrageously expensive, It would have 3. Yes I know, it's in Vegas and Vegas is expensive. But the Denny's style menu (breakfast lunch and dinner all day) just shouldn't be that much. \nAfter much debate between the make-your-own omelette or the french dip... I went with the french dip.\nIt was big. Maybe too big. I'd almost describe it as I had some bread with my meat. The sandwich itself wasn't bad. It was soaking wet with grease which was disappointing, but the quality was pretty good. The sauce (they do it with gravy instead of au jus) was waaaay too salty. Had they toned it down on the salt, it would have been a lot better. The saving grace were the fries. They were really quite good. \nIt's the noise level got a little obnoxious. I know its Vegas, but between the casino and the amount of employees yelling across the restaurant, it was a little much.\nWith the big menu and the convenience of being located in MGM, it may be worth a shot. However, get out your wallets... my french dip was $20. Ouch."
2,"Came here on a Saturday night, about 6 pm, after a failed attempt to get into another seafood buffet, where a line wait was over one-and-a-half hours, and we were seated immediately at Todai.  We are sushi snobs, and love to enjoy and critique sushi roll innovations,  combinations, textures, etc ,etc etc.  Here, we came with expectations congruent to a better sushi buffet restaurant. \n\nThe sushi offerings were \""typical\"" as found in better sushi buffets: plenty of rolls and nigiri, but here they also had sashimi, and a variety of hand rolls, as well as constantly replenished fresh oysters, crab legs and peeled shrimp.  The plentiful hot selections, as well as the teppanyaki and udon offerings make this a great destination for fans of the Japanese cuisine, who don't want to wait forever in line.  \n\nAnd of course - don't forget the desserts and drinks: we loved the Sho Chiku Bai Nigori unfiltered cold sake!  THREE-AND-A-HALF STARS"
0,"1st time and maybe the last. Wasn't impressed, but mainly due to the cook that was cooking on the 12th of July around 630pm. I ordered a carne asada taco on flour tortilla, 3 rolled tacos, bean burritos and shredded beef tacos. Bean burritos were good, but those are pretty hard to mess up. My carne taco came on corn, even though my receipt clearly said flour. The rolled tacos were soft and soggy in the middle, not crispy like they are supposed to be. Same with the shredded beef tacos, weren't in the fryer long enough. Might have been a new cook that night, but either way my first impression wasn't a good one."
1,"I used to really like Red Lobster. After many sub par experiences at different locations over the last couple of years I have come to the conclusion that Red Lobster is going downhill fast. Today I met my sister here for lunch around 1:30pm. We were seated right away but it took our waiter about 15 minutes to approach the table. We eventually got our drinks after asking twice. \n\nI looked over the lunch menu and they definitely had some new items since the last time I had dined with Red Lobster about six months ago. The lobster grilled cheese and shrimp salad sandwich were among the odd choices on the lunch menu. I went with the staple grilled shrimp house salad with a cup of clam chowder soup, my sister had fried shrimp and scallops. The food took at least 30 minutes to be served which I thought was quite ridiculous for a lunch service especially for some salad, soup and fried food. My clam chowder was mediocre at best, tasted like it came out of a can for sure and the grilled shrimp in my salad still tasted half frozen. My sister did enjoy her fried shrimp, maybe fried is the way to go at Red Lobster because clearly fresh is not the top priority here.\n\nOverall bad. Service was just mediocre. Food was bad. I will not be back anytime soon."
0,"On principle I hate this place. \n\nLet me explain - the type of person who comes here has too much money, too much hair product, thinks he is a hit with the ladies and drives a clapped out astra with a body kit on it. \n\nWho in thier right mind would pay \u00a370 for a pair of jeans? I live in jeans and there is no way I can see them surviving much longer than two weeks before they have holes in them. Unless of course they were 'designed' to have holes in them. A-holes."
1,"Let me start by saying that I am usually a pretty forgiving person when it comes to restaurants. I really try to see the goods when there are bads and I will usually give a place a second chance since I understand that the wrong item is sometimes ordered. Yes, in a perfect world, every item on a restaurant menu should be amazing, but that simply is not the case. Anyways, I digress. This review is going to be pretty harsh because I honestly found nothing good about this place. Thank god I only came here because I had a gift card that needed to be used. I would have been pretty pissed if I actually had to pay for what we got.\nWhen entering CD, I was somewhat impressed with the d\u00e9cor. However, even though the seats look big and cozy, I did not find them to be that way at all. Also, the hostess was not overly friendly. She wasn't mean or anything but not friendly either. The hubby and I decided to order the pretzels and fondue that everyone else raves about. It was ok. The pretzels were soft but most were not hot, and the fondue was simply ok in my opinion. For entrees, I decided on the sweet corn cannelloni while the hubby chose the fried chicken. I would also like to add that hubby was going to order the 36 hour ribs believing they would be fall off the bone, what with cooking for that long. The waitress was actually considerate and thoughtful enough to let him know that since they were not babybacks, these ribs were not going to be fall off the bone and most past customers actually felt they were a bit tough. After that information, he decided to retreat and order the chicken instead. \nThe entr\u00e9e portions were actually larger than we had expected. However, neither entr\u00e9e was impressive. My \""cannelloni\"" turned out to actually be ravioli. Also, I was surprised by the intense flavor of bacon on my dish, which don't get me wrong was ok since I eat meat. For someone who is vegetarian on the other hand, this really should have been mentioned on the menu. The flavor was ok, but really nothing impressive. The husband easily allowed me to try his chicken, which I knew was not a good sign. Usually when something is really good, he will be a pain in the ass about letting me try it and usually will tell me order my own. The chicken itself was cooked ok, but the batter had no flavor to it and the honey drizzle was only in certain places. The hubby was disappointed in the entire entr\u00e9e stating that the biscuit didn't have enough honey and no butter provided, the mashed potato portion was puny and they were nothing impressive, and the 2 bites of coleslaw were bland. \nBecause we had a 50.00 gift card, we needed to order something else so we decided on the apple money bread dessert. We were told that it would take an extra 12 minutes, which we were fine with because we thought it would be something amazing. Not even close. What came out was a small dish of \""monkey bread\"" (which resembled bread pudding) and a small bowl of vanilla ice cream atop cut out pieces of menu which we presumed to be pre-used due to the large grease stain on the one underneath the bowl of ice cream. The monkey bread was very disappointing as it was mostly apples, and the cinnamon/ sugar mixture appeared to be sprinkled atop after the dish was done baking. Additionally, there was a spice used in it (I think it was ginger) that was wayyyyy too prominent. It left a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. The ice cream was fine but we were pretty sure it was Dreyers. \nAfter finishing dessert, we waited and waited... and waited... only to wait some more. We had already let it slide that our waters were empty while eating dessert to which the waitress said she had several other tables seated so she was scrambling back and forth between them all. I found it interesting that she said this because the restaurant was practically empty. Anyways, as we sat waiting for the check, the hubby informed me that the delay was because she was sitting at a table with some obvious friends who had come in and basically just shooting the sh**. This really annoyed me. Normally, I am a patient person, but after having a crappy meal, I really just wanted to get home. I believe we waited for about 20 minutes just to get the check without her attempting to check on us during that time. \nSo to conclude, Culinary dropout was highly disappointing. Food was not great, service was crappy... This is one of the few instances where nothing impressed me and I see absolutely no reason to return to Culinary Dropout. I gave it 1 extra star because the food was not horrible, portion sizes were decent, and the d\u00e9cor was aesthetically pleasing. One last thought though: Maybe the chef should go back to culinary school to learn how to season chicken properly and perhaps learn the difference in pasta's?"
3,"This is classic desert resort at its best.  Mellow and yet with full amenities.  I stayed in the \""Oasis\"" area on the 2nd floor--not a casita--but really liked it.  It was quiet and had a beautiful deck overlooking the Oasis pool area.  \n\nKaren at the front desk was terrific too.  \n\nOnly criticisms were 1) the lack of readily available info on the fitness classes held which I would have liked to have gone to if I had known 2) the water slide at the second (main) pool was out of service.\n\nInternet is now included as part of the $18 resort fee.\n\nI would stay there again."
2,"Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #21 - #365\n\nAfter a long 3 1/2 hour drive from California, checking into the Bellagio, and getting settled in the room, they start craving for Asian food. The first restaurant that comes up in Noodles because it's not too big like the other restaurants and it's tucked away right by the Baccarat Bar and table games. \n\nEvery time we wait to be seated, it takes about 15 - 20 minutes but when Chinese customers wait, they are seated right away like they were, V.I.P.'s. Sounds like discrimination to me!  The Contemporary decoration in this restaurant was very relaxing with various jar of ingredients they use for their overpriced food. \n\nOur server was friendly and personable and gave us our drinks right away with some time to order. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n*Hot Tea $4.50 -- Jasmine\n\n*CHILEAN SEA BASS $34: Nonya curry sauce, bell peppers, onions (steamed) Homemade garlic ginger sauce, broccoli (steamed or deep fried) Soy sauce, green onions, ginger (steamed)\n\n*BEEF $22 Kung pao sauce, bell peppers, onions, peanuts Broccoli, straw mushrooms, carrots Mongolian style, bell peppers, onions, green onions\nBlack pepper sauce, asparagus Black bean sauce, bell peppers, onions, garlic\n\n*CHINESE BROCCOLI $12.50 Saut\u00e9ed in garlic or steamed (oyster sauce)\n\n*CANTONESE ROAST DUCK $18.50 Plum sauce\n\nThe food in my honest opinion was delicious and I couldn't fault on anything. What bothered me and caused the review to go from 5 stars to 2 stars was the service. It took us a while to get our refills for out water and the food took about 25  - 35 minutes to be served. \n\nOur server kept telling us, \""the food was on it's way,\"" my Dad got tired of waiting and went to hit the slots. Around the restaurant, I noticed a lot of Chinese customers were getting their food much faster than us and that made me irritated. I never experienced this level of service. \n\nNest time, I'll avoid this over priced restaurant and go for the Bellagio Snack bar where I can receive excellent service and cheaper eats."
4,The food is always so fresh and tasty. the service is awesome! My lil one and i are regulars. We love you five and diner on southern ave!
4,Jill Flynn is an amazing photographer!  I have AZ Prussian Snailhound Dog Rescue and her pictures really help to get our pups good homes!  She really captures their personalities in the photographs.  I highly recommend her!
1,"I ate here as part of the Mystere dinner package, and am VERY glad I did because if you price the tickets to the show properly, the dinner was VERY cheap, and I wouldn't have wanted to actually paid full price for anything here. I may be being a bit harsh because I expect a lot out of steak house dinners, but I am just telling it like it is!\n\nFor an appetizer, the boy and I both got the lobster and corn chowder. I will definitely give them this one and say that it was very good.  The pieces of lobster were delicious, and the consistency was perfect. The main courses is where it goes down hill. The salmon that I got was extremely bland and gooey. After a few bites I felt a little nauseated. The horseradish hollandaise sauce tasted like watery mayonnaise with absolutely no kick, the asparagus I had on the side was wilted, thin, and burnt. The boy had the 8oz filet mignon which had a weird tin-like flavor about it. I ordered a glass of reisling (the only one on their menu which was surprising) which was tasty, but the server brought it out in a metal container and literally just dumped it into my glass causing it to splash up a bit and create a lot of air bubbles. I don't know how you're supposed to treat wine, I am not much of a wine person, but I don't think dumping it is the right way to go! Now for the reason I am giving it 2 stars and not 1: The creme brule. It may be extremely tiny, but it was wonderful! So creamy and sweet, the sugar on top heated and solidified to perfection. Yay for creme brule! Overall, I would say I am very disappointed. The atmosphere was weird and uncomfortable, and the food was blah. If you want a wonderful steak house meal, definitely go to Craft at MGM! They treat you like kings and their food is breath taking!"
2,It's good for the price. Who goes to Vegas to stay in the room during the day anyway.
3,"This is a really great burger place.  We made our own burgers with the toppings we wanted and it was delicious!  The service is great, and its a chill spot to have drinks and good ol' burgers.  The fries are yummy, we had the criss cross and skinny fries, but the skinnies were better.  Check out the 777 burger, for $777 you can get a burger with some rose dom."
3,"I have been to many Korean bbq restaurants. This place can be a pretty cool place for date nights or if you want to hangout with your friends and sing karaoke. The staffs are super friendly and they make sure to check up on you often to see if everything is okay. I like meat, they have meat. The food is pretty decent/good, depending on what you get. I don't always drink but when I do, I prefer more on the menu. Stay thirsty my friends."
4,"Possibly the best asian restaurant I have ever been to. The setup of the restaurant was nice and simple without looking ghetto. When I opened up the menu, I was surprised that everything was vegan and they had a large variety with things like shrimp, pan fried fish, and squid (how is that even possible?). I had an appetizer... don't really remember what I had so I can't comment on it (I think it was fried wonton or soup or something). For my main course, I had the sizzling beef vegetables which as delicious as it looked. Finally, for desert I had the fried ice cream. It was a bit too sweet for my taste but it was okaay. Overall, had a good time and good conversations."
4,"Aah, Scotmid Nicholson Street - you are my favourate late night food haunt, forget all the burger joints and kebab shops.\n24 hours of everything and anything you could fancy - its great.\n\nI used to live across the road from here, and late at night you could see queues of late night party goers waiting for thier turn to buy late night snacks. Amazing really, I dont know anywhere like else like this.\n\nDuring the day it isnt the best of shops - theres a much bigger tesco across the road for your day -to-day shopping needs, so really it only becomes outstanding at one when tesco closes.\n\nWhen you are drunk and hungry and everywhere else is closed - this is the place to be!"
0,"i ordered delivery from here recently. i assumed that an $18 basic cheese pizza would have high quality ingredients, but this was not the case. there was absolutely nothing about it that could justify the price...i've had better for under $12 elsewhere, so that was disappointment #1.\n\n#2 was their bruschetta. i HOPE it was just a mix up, but the bruschetta had parsley on it???? and no basil. so basically it was just sloppily diced tomatoes, parsley, and a negligible amount of garlic and olive oil on untoasted white bread: i.e. not something i would ever purposely order."
0,"Live music =  Drunk Woman singing on stage along with some crappy southern compilation cd. \nFood = Four vendors, all with lines far too long to bother with. \nCrawfish = Massive line, 1 guy cooking in a pot. \nHeritage Tent = Didn't exist.\nBourbon Street Bartenders serving Daquiri's and Hurricanes = Didn't exist. \n\nFalse advertising at it's worst. There's no excuse for how bad this event was.The only good thing is that they didn't argue when we asked for a refund."
1,"Okay Baja Fresh, I like you.\n\nBut, I like Chipotle better.\n\nI usually get some kind of salad bowl thingy from Chipotle, so I tried Baja's grilled chicken bowl, but it didn't really stand up.\n\nIt was just okay, but not great.\n\nThe grilled chicken was fresh, but I can't figure out what they put on it so that it came chargrilled orange. (?)  Strange, but the taste was okay.\n\nThe chips that come with every meal are pretty bland and seemed a bit stale.\n\nThere were some okay sauces on the salsa bar.  I did like that part, but the ones behind the counter at Chipotle are better.\n\nAnd just in case you want Chipotle now, there is one in the same shopping center as this one. Ha."
0,This lame boat/truck hybrid ran me off the road into a pole as I was riding my bike. Stay off the bike path or move to the side. Learn how to drive. \n\nPay attention to what you are doing or next time you will hurt somebody.
0,You can do better than this. Incompetent doctor(s) and office staff. I am a nurse and to characterize this office as nothing but a frustration is a compliment.
0,"Like the others I will be grieving the loss of this restaurant for a very long time.  Going to Kampai was like going home.  It was all about the food and the wonderful people who served it.  The food at Kampai was always the BEST.  It was like the Japanese version of Cheers where everyone knew your name.  Megan, EJ, EJ, and Yugi knew every member of my family by name.  I was on a first name basis with many of the patrons who visited regularly and will miss all the good times.  The oohing and ahhing when someone ordered grilled Amberjack head, shishito peppers, handmade gyoza or cured salmon that you couldn't get anywhere else in the valley.  The superior qualify of the fish that was butchered in house.  The precision of Japanese tradition that Yugi proudly passed on to his loyal apprentices.  I understand that Yugi wanted to retire, and wish him well.  I respect both EJs who quit because the new owners wanted to cut corners in every way using low quality, pre-butchered fish and prepackaged foods.  Helloooooo new owners...we can tell the difference!!!!  We won't be back to eat your nasty Americanized fast-food style food.  On a good note...I found EJ at Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale!  And I hear \""mohawk\"" EJ is working at a sushi bar in Cave Creek."
4,"I have been going here for about 3 years now on a referral from a friend.  I finally decided that I should at the very least repay George for his honest and good work on my car by writing a good review for him here. \nEverytime I have had to bring my car in, it has been a great experience. \nHe charges fair prices for high quality work.  But the most important thing about this shop is the honesty.  Something that is severely lacking in most of the auto repair community.  Instead of adding on items that \""need\"" to be repaired to up my bill, he will tell me when I don't need something.  That is worth its weight in gold. Most recently, I brought my car in because it was having problems starting. Sun Devil Auto said I had a bad starter and needed a new serpentine belt along with it. A $500.00 repair. George told me the truth. It was a dying battery and my serpentine belt still had several months left on it. I left happily in less than an hour and only spent about $100.00.  Easily the best mechanic I have ever had. As long as George continues to run Rob's Quality Automotive I will go there."
1,"Of all places to actually update for a third time.  I'm not even big on updating yet I am writing even more about the Bistro f'n Buffet.  You'd think I would spend updates on more high end restaurants but no!  I am pulling the trigger once again on a \""mediocre on its best night\"" buffet.\n\nWe always eat here for free and the crab is the only thing worth coming for.  Unbeknownst to us until we sat down was that they DON'T serve crab on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!!  Might as well not even be open then.      \n\nA few things have changed for the better.  They now offer all you can drink beer and wine.  Other additions include Thai curry (3 stars), falafel (2 stars) and salmon (2 stars).  It honestly looks as though a few Palms executives have been spending some time at the M Resort buffet by adding all this.  But if the M Resort is Susan Sarandon, Bistro Buffet is Lesley Ann Warren (although \""Clue\"" is one of the most underrated movies in the history of cinema)."
2,"This place is really cool, but it's also really overwhelming. I give it five stars for the awesome stuff they have in there. It was kind of like walking through a museum. I give it one star for the organization/quality of some of the things they were selling. At some point, my friend and I observed an old nail kit that was obviously well used and pretty gross. Things like that should just be thrown away... \n\nThat comes out to about three stars right?\n\nSo if you like looking at/buying old interesting possessions, this is a place for you - unless you get overwhelmed by small spaces and clutter easily. If that is the case, stay away from here."
1,"Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud, we couldn't hear our waitress and thus the specials or the people we were seated with. Everyone is back to back; no place to hang a coat or move between tables to visit the restroom. We won't go back."
3,"Finally a great alternative to the plethora of gelato shops... friendly cashiers will pass out or upon asking, provide itty bitty sample cups so you can self-serve samples.  You'll have to be pretty good about your hand eye coordination to get the samples into those cups, so I started putting in a tiny squeeze to fill the cup and top off w/ a second flavor, so I didn't have to ask for ... oh 12 cups or whatever to try all the flavors (no I didn't, but I eventually will).  :)\n\nSince it's self serve and charge by the ounce (37cents/oz at this time), you get this HUGE generous cup... obviously a good psych ploy to fill 'er up.  Go ahead... it's gooooood... red velvet cake batter and pistachio topped with Heath bars...  taro flavor is coming soon and can't wait to try the mochi topping.  \n\nWith my 3 variants (like 3 mini cones) + 1 scoop topping was under $3, I'm picking this over gelato in Chandler anytime."
2,"What a strange bunch of reviews for this restaurant.  Of course, you always get a few people who had a bad experience, sometimes because of something the restaurant did and sometimes because they just had a bad day.  And of course you always find a few people who LOVE everything.  But the mixture here makes me wonder if there aren't two restaurants named Ajo Al's at this address, or perhaps a time warp, virtual reality, or witch's spell.\n\nThe truth is -- Ajo Al's is an average old-school Mexican restaurant.  The chips are ok, the salsa is ok, meaning if you are hungry you'll eat them.  Some of the entrees are good, but you have to know what to order.  I recommend the chicken enchilada, which is overflowing with white meat chicken.  Some entrees are just decent, like the beef tamale -- lots of beef filling but it had a lackluster flavor.  The beef tacos are ok, the rice is ok, the whole beans are ok.\n\nIf you just need a quick fix of standard Mexican, and Ajo Al's is conveniently nearby, I don't think you will be seriously offended.  If you want anything more, this is not your burrito, amigo."
1,Good price for the different buffets but not all the buffets are good. Do not try if you have more than 8 people. All the buffets will charge you gratuity each time before sitting and if you don't pay they will make your family and friends split even if there's an open table next to you. Paris was a HORRIBLE experience. Service was horrible and they made it so complicated for my whole family to sit together even though there was an open table next to us. Food in Paris wasn't all that great either except for the crepes. Rio is the best buffet. But it's hard to eat so much in 24 hours especially since its a buffet. So make sure you split your time wisely to try as many buffets as you can in 24 hours.
4,Nice hotel. Had a fridge in our room which is always good to keep out drinks cold! The pools were cool. The wave pool had the dj. Thought it was weird that they had wet t shirt and booty shaking contests with lil kids there. It should just be an adult pool.
0,"Would not even give this restaurant one star! The worst Mexican food I have ever had. The food had absolutely no taste, and the plate was drowning in cheese. Disgusting. Similar to what another reviewer wrote, the beef tastes like the beef from Taco Bell. In fact, Taco Bell has better Mexican food than this restaurant.\n\nThe prices are also absolutely ridiculous. Have not seen prices this high in all of Las Vegas. They really need to lower their prices if they expect to have customers!\n\nLastly, the service was horrible. After taking a drink order or giving us our check, the waiter would disappear for 20 minutes.\n\nOverall, a huge disappointment, and now I have a horrible stomach ache from the disgusting food.\n\nThanks Coyotes!"
2,"I was so freaking excited (aroused) upon seeing (drooling over/on) The Parlor's menu that I really don't understand how the experience ended up being so \""shmeh\"" (the technical term for the feeling of being passively disappointed but also pretty unmotivated to do anything about it.)\n\nTo be fair, the pasta I had was amazing... but then they took it off the menu. Just so you know, the chestnut and sheep's milk raviolini fandango that you will never have blew my mind thrice over and now it's gone forever. Dead. \n\nHere's the part that didn't work out: the pizza. What the deuce? It's a pizza place that's supposed to have great pizza. 0/3 liked it. The tomato sauce was weird and clashed with the toppings, the crust was forgettable, and I didn't finish it. And I am a human garbage disposal in the presence of fancy pizza.\n\nWould I give The Parlor another try? Maybe probably, but I'm heading straight to the pasta department this time."
2,"My husband and I come here a lot because we live close and it's one of our favorite sushi places (Probably because it was our favorite place to go with friends in high school). We are big sushi eaters and they have never disappointed us here. The staff is always friendly, although hard to understand sometimes. The place is a little cramped, but the sushi rolls make up for it. The dragon roll is my favorite,  hubby likes the tempura rolls. We sadly always end up spending close to $100 for just the two of us every time we go though, and never really leave with our tummies fully satisfied. The only thing that really bugs me is the atmosphere. The restaurant is small and cramped, with silk plants crowding some of the tables."
2,"OK, I feel a bit dumb and outdated... Came here at lunch time hoping to eat a small sushi plate not realizing that it was and all you can eat place. It's only now that I write this review that I realize that AYCE written in other reviews mean just that! I guess that I was born way sms and I never did catch-up to this common use of acronyms.\n\nIn any case, there is \""a la carte\"" menu here but the price of just a few individual items brings the bill up to more than the price of the \""AYCE\"" which was around $21 for lunch and around $25 for dinner. However, this is good sushi and the set price actually include nigiri with the limitation that you can have only one order of the more expensive ones. The orders are two pieces but the pieces are generous and there is enough variety to only eat nigiri is that's what you prefer (I tend to prefer nigiri has the ratio fish/rice is much higher and it's tastier according to my own taste). Not the highest quality sushi I ever had but quite nice and a good deal if you are hungry (I wasn't that much and ended eating too much)."
1,"I'm not quite sure how this restaurant rated as high as it does.  The rolls were bland and the AYCE deal was \""meh\"".   The staff did what they could to make it a good experience making it the only reason I didnt give this place a 1.  This said please understand the AYCE covers only the sushi, no teriyaki chicken etc.  After eating at hundreds of sushi places this goes in the bottom 15."
1,"Not to be a Negative Nancy, but I was not that excited about coming to this post office or any post offices for that matter. They have a security guard at this post office, because its not in the best part of the City and that in itself should tell you something. I decided to stop on by here, because it was down the street from the Building Department and I didn't want to drive across town just to go to another Post Office. The month of December is definitely NOT the time to mail out certified letters, etc. I waited in line for about 40 minutes, there were probably about 10 people ahead of me when I got there around 1120. I found out that the reason why it took so long was because there was only one person working the counter. I look back behind me and there's about another 10-15 people. When I finally got to the counter, the lady was nice hence the extra one star. I guess I should have known better then to go to the post office during this busy month, but I feel that they should have had more than one person working. Originally there were two people working, but one left to go on a lunch break. Maybe I'm just not understanding how the post office works, but I felt bad for the only person working. Oh such is life and I know I can't avoid going to the post office when needed for work or home."
4,I went here for the first time tonight and it was absolutely the most amazing food I've had uptown. RIBS FALLING OFF OF THE BONE!  The chicken was amazing and the service I received was FANTASTIC.  With out question request Gina as your server.  I can honestly say that I haven't received that kind of service at 5 star restaurants. Drop what you're doing and go NOW!
2,"Not really sure why this place has a bad Yelp rep.  \n\nThe wings are not all that bad and are certainly a step up from the usual 'bar food' wings that Charlotte seems to be notorious for.  I will say, if you are craving wings though, you might as well walk an extra 150 yards down the street to Lebowskis Grill because their wings are by far the best in Charlotte.  \n\nWhen we went here, we had wings, pizza, and beer.  Originally a Picasso's Sports Cafe, Sutton House hasn't changed all that much and appears to have assumed the menu.  It's a plus that they got all the Washington Redskins crap out of the back room!  (Go Bears).  :)\n\nIf you are wanting Pizza & Wing combo, I don't know of a better place in the Dilworth area.  Not the best Pizza in Charlotte, or the best Wings in Charlotte, but rarely does one place do both well enough to credit."
4,"Had something different every visit, always amazing! One of the times was my first time ever experiencing Ethiopian food and I was not disappointed. Everything is very fresh, very flavorful. Slightly off the strip so its enough out of the way but not hard to find. Must try!"
1,Checked out the reviews on yelp so decided to give this spot a try since I live close by. Drove into an empty parking lot. That was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway. The restaurant was dark and the service was ok. I ordered camarones rancheros. The shrimp was overcooked... Rice and beans were ok... Overall not impressed. Wont be coming back.
4,"I loved this place! Came for a little romantic dinner with my love right before enjoying the Suns basketball game. We had a wonderful walk to this place. It was a very romantic scenery. The view was lovely, the food was delicious. New great memories for him and I.  The pizza was jus wonderful very filling for the both of us. First thing I thought of was artichoke on pizza? Eh idk. But that was my fav! Definitely coming back for more. Thank you for the lovely staff and for the musician playing romantic songs during our dinner it was just lovely all the way around."
0,"I think this place closed. There's a notice on the door that says \""Notice of Bankruptcy Chapter 7\"""
2,"Just like Corinne indicated (11/13/08 review), the steaks are way too overcooked.  I ordered a filet, medium rare, and 2/3 of my steak was too tough to eat!  The only consolation was they had decent wine..."
0,"Was debating between 1 or 2 stars because my breakfast sandwich and coffee were good, but chose just 1. The other bad reviews on this location are right on par with my complaint. My advice is to go to another location completely. The female cashier I encountered was rude. \n\nFirst, I walked in and looked at the pastries and she said hello 3 times like she was trying to rush me and there wasn't even a line behind me. When I asked if they had a particular sandwich available, she said abruptly said yeah and gave me a snotty look. Then, I gave her my credit card and she snatched it out of my hand. Is customer service just not taught or emphasized anymore these days? Guess not."
4,"In the last decade, Cold Stone has come onto the scene as the big new chain of ice cream parlors. And with a selection like this, places like Baskin-Robbins are going to have their work cut out for them.\n\nEssentially, Cold Stone has the basic stuff you'd expect from an ice cream place - cups and cones with various flavors, shakes, cakes, and everything in between. What sets Cold Stone apart (and something other places have started copying) is \""mix-ins\"" - selecting toppings and actually having them \""ground in\"" to your ice cream, rather than simply sprinkled on top. It sounds like a pretty basic idea, but the results speak for themselves.\n\nThe ice cream itself is some of the best this reviewer has ever tasted. The flavors cover all the basics (vanilla, chocolate, etc.), but there are plenty of premium exclusive flavors as well. Regardless of your tastes, Cold Stone will have something up your alley.\n\nThe staff are always friendly and courteous, and even start erratically singing ice cream-related songs. Not really praising or insulting that, I just thought it was worth mentioning because no other ice cream place does it. This is one of the few ice cream jars to have a tip jar where the employees actually serve a few coins in there.\n\nQuite honestly, I don't really have anything to complain about. I have never gone in Cold Stone and left disappointed. This place is the future of ice cream.\n\nTRIVIA: An episode of King of the Hill featured an ice cream parlor called \""Frozen Cow\"", which was essentially a parody/homage of Cold Stone."
1,"i went here for lunch last week,after reviewing the menu i decided on the meatloaf sandwich may be i didnt read the discription but what i got was a open face sandwich the piece of loaf wasnt big enough to cover the bread and was a thin piece as well. the price was stiff for the portion served. beer selection fair service decent. i may return to try wings but at this point not high on my list"
3,"Les pommes de terre au d\u00e9jeuner sont excellentes, de m\u00eame que le caf\u00e9."
3,"When you are ready to judge a south of the boarder restaurant by the food vs. the price and quantity this is a good destination for dinner. The cammorones a la diabla is hot but not too hot that you loose the flavors (and your taste buds). Some good ice cold Central American beers at $3.50 goes great with the food. For those of you or your guests that prefer some thing alcohol free try the pineapple Jarritos y Sangria. There plantains, both sweat and not sweat, are a step from the average. \nTry their lunch specials posted on a white board, straight in front of you as you enter. They are all excellent. My favorite is their sopa, a bowl of broth filled with huge pieces of meat and vegetables. Sorry for the locals but they do not serve iced tea."
3,Authentic & formal dining but not strict dress code.  Aloo gobi was great & very hot. Great waitstaff.
4,Awesome patio!  My girl and I love this place. Love Friday night's here when they have entertainment.
3,"Yuuuuuummmmmmmm.\n\nYou know you have a damn good pizza when you compare it to one you had whilst in Rome, and your new prize wins.\n\nLovely, friendly service, delicious appetizer, and good wine. Not to mention it has a lovely atmosphere--we walk past this place often and always paused by the windows with our noses pressed against the glasses, peering inside wistfully like children, commenting, \""Doesn't that look cozy?\""\n\nAnd indeed it was. If you're looking for some good Italian eats, give this place a shout."
1,"Came here twice this weekend. Is it worth the $15 cover on Fridays? Not really. I thought it was a bit too much. If you're into seeing old creepy men looking up your skirt, overpriced drinks, half naked bar girls spanking you with a paddle and acting like a drunk fool on the mechanical bull, well you found a lovely place. The DJ was great though. Nice mix of pop and hip hop music."
3,The Los Sombreros 10 Course Tasting Menu ($50. for TWO) is PHENOMENAL and is something you shouldn't miss out on if you are thinking of trying flavors of Central Mexico as the special will end sometime call or check website. I was told they are extending the special past August to promote the new menu and new restaurant they are opening.\n\nYou get. Chips and two Fresh Salsas.\n\nTwo cups Pozole Soup\nTwo Hibiscus Taquitos\nFig & Panela Cheese Salad\nShrimp & Papaya Salad\nSalmon with Mango Salsa\nTrout with Almonds in Lemon Butter & Capers\nChile Rellenos with Beef Picadillo\nPechuga Rellena (Stuffed Chicken Breast in Chipotle Tomato Sauce)\nPork Loin with Tamarind Mole\nHouse Made Piloncillo Ice Cream\n\nEverything had delicious flavors.\n\nI never had Hibiscus Taquitos before and they were a stand out. A little sweet and cheesy and tangy they were delicious.\n\nThe Chile Relleno stuffed with Beef were very unlike any other I had before being much lighter and MUCH tastier than any other I ever had. I liked that they weren't a fried battered kind like you get at most places and only had just the right touch of cheese on them.\n\nThe four entrees were all delicious but a few were over cooked but very ACCEPTABLE and that is the only reason I didn't up this place to five stars but I was five stars happy.\n\nThe house made Ice cream was very fresh tasting and the most creamy ice cream I remember trying in a while.\n\nThis place is far above average and is very good but it's a small place and many tables inside are high tops.\n\n\n\n4.5 Stars
1,"I came here with a friend to smoke shisha a few weeks back. They don't have a separate area inside to smoke so you have to sit at the tables outside. It.was.freezing. And our umbrella blew over on us... This place has some pretty decent food, but if your looking to smoke shisha with your dinner, a better place that has separate smoke rooms that are warm is \""Pomegranate\"" over in new town."
4,"So yummy! It's not badly priced, it's good, I really can't complain. This place has always been clean. I really like supporting these local businesses too. I hope this place doesnt go away like many of the other stores that have been in this shopping center. It's never crowded (I'm usually the only one in there). I always take my sister there for an after school snack. Waffle sandwhiches=yummmm"
4,Leo has taken care of our car needs for years. We call him for everything even if it is just a recommendation. Leo always takes the time to answer our questions and helps us brainstorm the possibilities. It is hard to find an honest mechanic in Vegas that is willing to offer top customer service with it.   We recommend Leo to all our friends and even more importantly to our family members.
0,"Amazingly awful.  My property manager signed a lease without having ever walked through the home to ensure anything was working.  No heat, no water, broken dishwasher, refrigerator, etc... you name it.  They have no ethics and are slow to respond to anything; if they even respond at all.  \n\nThey are basically investor slum-lords.  Maximizing investor profits, by providing little service, the worst appliances, and service.  Its a shame really because some of the properties could be really nice, they are just not willing to put in the effort."
2,"Mad Greek has been a couple of things, including what my wife called \""The Best Waffle in the Queen City.\"" I don't know if they do waffles any more, but they do have a good selection of short order food with a Greek focus. My eye was drawn to the gyro platter and so that's what I went with.\n\nGood service - the waitress was attentive and took my order and refilled my glass without needing any prompting. Unobtrusive but attentive.\n\nCheck out the picture. The gyro dinner a good pile of slice lamb meat (I assume from the spit) that had been grilled again. A sliced pita on the side. And a huge pile of tossed salad with Italian dressing, feta cheese and some olives which make it a Greek salad, I suppose. And some nice crunchy fries on a separate plate.\n\nI left stuffed for $12 which I think is a pretty good deal for an \""out of the box\"" dinner."
3,"I am a customer regular of the keg,I thought this keg in Laval is very chic,I like so much the washroom here....hahahaha!the service was ok.,not wow!!!"
0,I am not impressed with the sushi. It's not that great. I was very disappointed. I don't believe I will ever try it again. I think a Chinese delivery place would make better sushi.
4,"Respectful and made me feel comfortable.  I am recommending to my friends and family.  They combined my monthly pest control and year round weed control for a great price, no more HOA problems here!  Thanks!"
4,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS, HANDS DOWN!!!\n\nCome for brunch (make sure you get there at least by 1 p.m., because they close at 2 p.m.). It's around $25, which surprisingly is cheaper than most Vegas buffets of much lower quality.\n\nThe selection of food is ridiculous, everything from breakfast to short ribs to sushi to fried chicken, just everything. And their desserts are unbelievable! One of my favorites that I've seen there a couple times is a Chocolate Molten Cake. They also have a section with about 15 different Gelatos to choose from, including a Nutella flavor.\n\nBesides the food, another reason why Wicked Spoon is the best is because the majority of the food is in individual serving dishes. It's not like most buffets where you have to scoop up what you want out of a huge serving platter, which is disgusting because you have so many people coming into contact with what you're about to eat.\n\nI can't say enough great things about Wicked Spoon, a MUST when in Vegas."
3,"I really enjoyed the blue raspberry and Apple Bon bons, but I wasn't a fan of the macaroon. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was light and fluffy, but the favors were off for me. The service was great and the staff were very friendly. I would go again."
2,"I love being in the area of this restaurant.  It just speaks luxury. And this place is in a perfect location.  Awesome Christmas tree was right in view. Stunning. Wish I felt the same excitement for the restaurant itself.\n\nNow, it wasn't bad.  The food was quite good.  We actually went in to get something quick and non-filling, like a nice salad.  I found on the menu a Kale Salad.  It was good, but for 14 bucks, it wasn't THAT good.  And my uncle's 11 dollar bowl of soup simply was not worth the price.\n\nGiven all of that, our servers, though nice and friendly, were just not the most attentive waiters.  It took too long to arrive, take our orders and then return.  And this was only during the middle of the day.  It really wasn't that busy. But everyone seemed to be doing quite a bit of running around.\nNice place but could use some improvements in customer service, IMO."
1,"Don't blame me. I was hungry, and it was there."
0,"1st visit, decent sushi, close to home, fairly priced. In light of the fact that there were only 6 people in the place I felt like the wristband proving my ability to drink was uncalled for. (Im 36 and bald) but whatever. \n\n2nd visit, sat down at 945 (weariong a wrist band) my gf had arrived much earlier and ordered me a beer. (they gave last call at 930) She also explained that they were gonna close at 10 so I needed to hurry, at 10:06 I had almost finished my food and we had paid the bill so no one was waiting for us. the server was friendly as could be.\n\nThe sushi chefs started changing their shirts and turning the lights off in the area we were sitting. There is a reason most \""chefs\"" are hidden in the back, they all have the social graces of a masturbating monkey. \n\nSo in a nutshell, it cost me $80 to find out that the idiots behind the sushi bar run the show at this china star super buffet-turned-sushi bar.\n\nto the owners, Spend the $80 wisely because I was one of 3 customers in the entire place and I wont be returning. My guess is you wont be the last business in a retarded long string of failed restaurants in that location, unless of course you get a whole lot better."
0,"I wanted to go to the Earl of Sandwich but the line was too long, just like it was last summer. So we settled for this place because it looked good. The clam chowder bowl was pretty good. My boyfriend said the shrimp tacos were okay. I got the lobster and waffles. DON'T get this. First of all, the waffle turned out to be a pancake. Then the lobster pieces were covered in so much batter. The batter tasted like grease and the lobster was chewy. This was a very disappointing and expensive meal."
4,"Urban Beans is my neighborhood coffee shop. I could walk here, if I wished. \n\nI am a beverage snob, and definite foodie. I hadn't had their food until recently, so I didn't feel I could have written an adequate review. ;) The service is prompt and the baristas are usually friendly and helpful!\n\nBut... Holy biscotti, batman!\n\nI tried the Honey Smoked Salmon Salad and have tried chocolate-orange, and lemon-lavender biscotti. Pastry aside, the food was delightfully healthy, with a touch into decadence, if you so desire.\n\n Each dip of the biscotti in my \""Kiss\"" (Chocolate & Caramel) iced latte was stellar. The biscotti was even moist enough to eat without dipping it into the latte. \n\nThe Honey Smoked Salmon Salad was stellar! It wasn't raw salmon, like I expected (I LOVE salmon). The texture with homemade croutons and the crisp, cool greens were a perfect compliment. I don't recall what the dressing was, but it appeared to have dijon mustard grains in it. I would eat this probably about 300 more times... Today. Right now.\n\nMy S.O. had a Turkey and Brie sandwich, which he enjoyed... It was wonderful... Cuz I had to steal a bite, myself! ;) It was healthy and served with fresh fruit! I could be biased, however, as turkey sandwiches are my absolute favorite. \n\nThe bathrooms are CLEAN and unisex. The patio is lovely in the cooler months, and breezy! Th interior is delightfully vintage, yet urban, in appeal, and clean & comfortable for co-working, or just screwing around online, like co-working tends to lead with me. \n\nMy usual order for coffee has become the iced coffee with sugar-free mocha. I cream it to my taste, and carry on. I, admittedly, hadn't had good coffee for awhile, and remembered why I started turning my nose up at bad coffee, upon first sip of their lattes and iced coffee.\n\nAnother thing that stands out to me is their array of LOCAL goods!! I'm very pro-local shopping when it's doable, and they bring it right to you with too-tempting popcorn, jellies, oils, teas, and jellies... Just to name a few!\n\nAll in all... I can see myself walking here in the cooler months, to enjoy a local, tasty lunch... And doing this quite often! Or even dropping by for my morning coffee fix. ;)"
1,"I love the concept of Bluebird Kitchen, but have been severely disappointed both times I have eaten here. The food is extremely bland. Today I was a bit shocked by the turkey sandwich I ordered. Not only did it not have much flavor, but it seemed that it had been made at least three days earlier and had been hanging out since then, you know, like the sandwiches at 7-11. I can't believe I paid $9 for a sandwich that tasted like gas station food. I won't be coming back to Bluebird Kitchen."
2,"Went in on a Saturday night at 7pm. Did nor have to wait for our table.  Was sat down by the manager and he took our drink order. Shortly after our waitress took our meal order. Took a bit for our shake to be made but it was tasty. When our meal arrived, they had taken it upon themselves to add cheese to the top of my spaghetti instead of asking if I would like any or how much. Once I took a bite into my food, I noticed the lack of sauce and how dry the meatballs were. Not tasty at all. The staff also left our refilled cups on our table our whole meal. Something we've noticed was how unorganized the staff were at finding their tables. They were asking each other who ordered what food and where it went. \n\nA waitress did notice I looked unhappy with my food and offered to get me a free burger & fries. I believe it's called a \""Bob Burger\"". When we got our receipt, they had also took my spaghetti off my ticket.\n\nI do have to mention the Bob Burger was tasty, flavorful, juicy and filling. I loved every bite of it."
4,"Wonderful service!!! The 3 ladies who cleaned our house were so detailed and did not skimp on anything. They arrived on time and were so nice. My husband and I were so impressed with how clean our house was, and we will definitely be returning customers."
4,"Back in the early 1980's, I had a wonderful and tasty breakfast at this IHOP. The pancakes and scrambled eggs tasted pretty good after spending most of the night traveling thru the Mohave Desert from Bakersfield, California. Place was clean and the staff was friendly. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntra"
1,"I went to the Daily Dose today for breakfast and honestly didn't think much of it. I got the egg sandwich on a bagel and it was one of the most boring least delicious egg sandwiches I have ever had. Anyone who knows me knows that I LOVE a good egg sandwich. I think a good egg sandwich is simple and lets the ingredients speak for themselves. This was not like that. It was on a bagel, which I thought was too much bread for a good bread to filling ratio, it had cold mealy tomatoes on it. The tomatoes made the entire dish cold quickly. I took them off. Overall, this sandwich was just not what I like in an egg sandwich...maybe others will like it, but I just didn't think it had that simple deliciousness that I expect in an egg sandwich. Also, the sandwich came with some potatoes that were pretty standard and some fruit that was just ok. The BF got the pb&j waffle. This was good, but also on the cold side. The PB was on top, but wasn't melty like you would want on top of a waffle. The waffle was a bit soggy, and though it did taste like a pb&j sandwich I'm not sure why you would pay 10$ to have something that tastes like a 1$ or less sandwich you can make at home. Our bill was 30$....there is no way this food is worth that much money. I will say, the service was good and the manager came by a couple times, so that was nice. Despite the good service, the mediocre food and high prices combined with the wealth of good breakfast places in the downtown and midtown areas will keep me from returning to Daily Dose."
0,"The Avondale / Goodyear Sprouts is crap. I first shopped at Sprouts in Surprise and liked it. Moved to Goodyear and discovered this Sprouts is not good. \n\n1. Many of the staff are dregs. They are not friendly and don't care about their work. Sure, there are a few good ones but they are out numbered. \n\n2. The Organic veggie section is a joke. Many old and moldy veggies. \n\n3. One day I saw a 'dreg' stocking veggies in the organic section and noticed he was stocking non-organic carrots. I asked him about it. He had no idea and asked another veggie guy who said \""oops, those aren't organic'. Came back two days later to see the same non-organic carrots back on the organic shelf. WTF?\n\n4. One day they had some dairy items in a plastic display case on ice near check out. Only problem was the ice was all gone and the product was room-temperature warm. \n\nI have lost trust in this sore and Sprouts in general. \n\nAlso Sprouts has gone 'corporate' and lost their brand focus. You can find Sprouts branded baked goods with HFC in it. It is a premium product yet they can't spend 1 or 2 cents more for sugar? That means the bean counters have taken over. THey have lost their focus. \n\nUnfortunately thee isn't an alternative in the west valley."
1,"Overrated.  My wife and I love buffets and have been to most of the buffets in Vegas.   We both agreed this buffet was slightly disappointing.   Positives:  the decor was very nice and the wait staff was very friendly and timely, no line and was seated immediately(Thursday night), the shrimp ceviche, prime rib, baked salmon, and several of the pasta dishes were very good.   Negatives:  the snow crab legs were tiny, the \""asian\"" bar was just pathetic, the 3 different sushi rolls were supermarket quality, the desert bar was disappointing, and just the overall offering was fairly weak.   The salad bar looked pretty good if you're into salads, but my wife and I don't pay $40+tax+tip to go to a buffet for salads.   This buffet should be about $27 instead of $40.  You can do much better for the money."
3,"First thing you will notice is their insane chocolate fountain hidden behind a thick layer of glass. Apparently it is the world's largest chocolate fountain in existence. \n\nIn any case, gelato and crepes are top-notch. Prices are on point given how expensive Vegas has become. Worth a stop if you need a break from the hustle and bustle of the casino floor."
3,Went here for lunch looking for an open sushi place and pretty glad we made the trip (a closer restaurant had a much lower review which deterred us from going there). The staff were incredibly helpful and attentive. I never had an empty glass (a HUGE pet peeve of mine when it take forever for a refill). We even got a complimentary appetizer (crab pancake? So good). Everything was absolutely delicious. The waiter helped us catch deals on the menu with items we were already ordering. Little pricey but we all left happy and full. I'd recommend this place to anyone I knew staying off strip in Vegas.
0,"They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \""were already at the airport\"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns"
1,"Wasn't impressed. I usually love these little hole in the wall places owned by locals and. This place just didnt do it for me. It was a little dirty, the workers were all pretty distracted and taking their sweet time and the music was SOOOO loud for 7am.\n\nSigh, i wish it had lived up to my expectations."
2,Great store...Mark was just rude!!!  Really like some of the stuff..a little pricey.  Some great deals ..just have to look hard..all the other clerks are wonderful..except for that ONE...
4,"Absolutely incredible gem hidden in the  Four Queens casino. This is an old school restaurant, the kind you can imagine Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci dining at. Every woman is given a red rose at the door. They have dishes you don't often see anymore such as Veal Oscar and Beef Wellington. The service is impeccable, the food is heavenly and I love the little touches, such as sorbet to cleanse the palate, chocolate covered fruit after dinner and hot washcloths. I just can't rave enough about this place! Going back already next Sunday!!!"
1,"Honestly, I love supporting small businesses whenever they open in our city of Las Vegas, but if you do please come with your game correct!  Wing Heaven was just a letdown.  \n\nThe concept is great, wings, fish, other fried delights.  But where Wing Heaven fails is in the execution of it all.  Just not what you would expect for a newer establishment.  I just couldn't give this place more stars if I tried.  If it was better when they first opened, then Wing Heaven should get back on the straight and narrow soon to keep patrons coming in at a good clip.  \n\nWing Heaven was a drive for us, a bit out of the way.  Entering the place, it is nice enough.  No tables if you plan on eating here, just a few stools and a flat screen TV or two for you to catch up on sports while you wait for your order.  And boy, did we WAIT.  It was a weekend night and it wasn't busy at all in the store.  There was one other couple ordering at the time.  1) We weren't greeted by the owner, or anyone in the place for that matter.  2) After the couple in front of us ordered, the owner and them proceeded to shoot the SH!+ with each other for at least 10 minutes (yes I timed them).  And not once did ANYONE greet us or tell us that they would be right with us.  A bit annoying.  3) When we finally did get to the register to place our order, the owner wasn't exactly friendly or welcoming with the wifey and I in his place.  Could be just that's his demeanor, but still, you want my continued business, please at least FAKE a smile to show some effort.  I got the whiff that his food was gonna speak for itself, so I figure I would just give it a chance.\n\nWe thought about the catfish (but I favor Mario's Westside for that), but ended up going with a pound of fried pollock because it was on special.  The seasoning we chose was Garlic Vinegar.  You know us Filipinos, lovin' our garlic and vinegar like it was salt and pepper.  The real reason we drove down to Wing Heaven was because my wife loves fried gizzards, and this was one of the only places I've heard of that serve them on a regular basis.  So we got a pound of those as well.  Paid, and proceeded to wait while our order was being prepared.  That was a long 10 minutes.  \n\nOwner finally warmed up a bit and asked us if we liked cheesecake.  He said he was going to make us a treat to try out.  Yay, some life out of this guy.  A few minutes later we are given a cheesecake bite of sorts with chocolate and raspberry sauce on top.  It was OK.  But I was expecting something a bit more homemade.  These seemed like those cheesecake bites you get from your local warehouse store, just covered up in batter and fried.  Good effort, but wish it was more original.  Glad we were offered it though, it's the only reason I went and gave Wing Heaven another star.\n\nUpon our take out order arriving I lifted the bag.  It really seemed LIGHT.  I had to ask behind the counter, \""Bro, you sure this fish is a pound?\""  Guy says yes.  I did the WRONG thing by just leaving with a \""Thanks\"" and not checking on my order.\n\nThe wifey and I finally drive back to our side of town and get to sit down to enjoy our meal, and immediately are disappointed.  Our pound of fried fish seemed so measly!  It looks like they included the weight of all the seasonings BEFORE frying!  So sad.  Our fish pieces were so small, and much of our fish order was in tiny bite size pieces.  Just bad!  Lots of batter bits, and not much fish.  The only thing good about this was the Garlic Vinegar seasoning, it gave good tang to what was lackluster fish.  I wish I had remembered to take pics of this, but it was so upsetting I totally disregarded it.  But the wifey can vouch for this fish being just a disappointment.  It came with a tiny condiment container of cole slaw, but that wasn't so tasty either.  Needed more vinegar, and less mayo.  Tartar sauce?  Nothing special.\n\nOn to the fried gizzards, which were a letdown as well.  Granted, our trip to our eating area wasn't very far, I wasn't expecting our fried items to hold up the greatest because just about everything at Wing Heaven is packed to go (since they have no real eating area in house).  But the gizzards were rubbery!  Like shoe leather rubbery!  It can mean two things - either the gizzards were overcooked OR the gizzards are a frozen-type product and not fresh made.  No amount of Louisiana hot sauce could really save these gizzards from being yummy.  No bueno.\n\nAbout $15 total for our order since we opted to not go the meal route, since it was our first time to Wing Heaven we wanted to feel out the food.  I really hate to say it, but looks like we won't be back anytime soon.  Maybe it was an off day for them, or maybe there are some kinks (one of the cooks seemed to be in training), but I just didn't connect with this place.  I know Wing Heaven specializes in wings but they just don't seem special compared to other wing joints.  Sorry, guys.  Disappointing.  Heaven this is not."

3,"Amazing breakfast food. A little pricey but the food is definitely fresh and very tasty! The service is great, fast and attentive. Family friendly."
0,"First off everyone knows you don't dry off a car in direct sun. This place has no covered area to finish wash/dry\n\nThey do not use air guns or even attempt to dry out door wells so you're guaranteed to have water spots dripping from every crevice.\n\nDanny's charges $5 extra for hand wash, this place wants $35 to hand wash. \n\nLastly for my $20 wash they did not dress my tires.  So either they forgot or don't do it - either scenario is crappy.  No excuses as I was the only car there, which may have been a harbinger of the poor car wash I got."
3,"While the ice cream is very good, I found the flavors to be uninspiring.  Churn is good  if your'e a classic-flavors kind of person, but I like to try new things and they didn't offer many beyond the traditional."
3,"Really tasty. A bit pricey, but for the strip not really surprising. Tuna appetizer was one of the best we have tasted. Great sake martini started things off for me. We also got a few rolls, dumplings, and apps to share. Also had the chocolate flour less cake with green tea ice cream. Everything was amazing. Super nice server was very attentive. Will definitely be back!"
3,"I've been a fan of Brew Dog beers for a while without ever really paying attention to anything other then they were a Scottish microbrewery created by 2 Scottish beer geeks.\n\nTheir beers are just a little overpriced for ne but I do enjoy going every few months for a couple of schooners of their latest creations. The bar has a ''studenty'' feel as you enter with big comfy booths and a spattering of tables and chairs covering the majority of the entrance area.\n\nThe beers are cold which is always good for real beers & ales but at \u00a34-4.50 per schooner, I go back to my point of the bar being a Iittle overpriced.\n\nService is dished up with an air of beery geeky Greek godliness which is just what I wanted, although being new to the BrewDog ways, I felt a little under pressure like I should have known what I was doing but that feeling went as quick as it came when the gent serving me allowed me to sample a few beers until I found one I liked.\n\nl didn't try the food, I did try the beers and I did like the music having quite a relaxing time doing so, even more so knowing there was a full bar for friends who maybe don't like beer (the shame). All in all a nice bar that achieves to deliver copious amounts at beer to Edinburgh's craft beer hungry population.\n\nWould definitely prefer to go with friends for a nice night out than on my own for a quick beer."
1,Not what it used to be.  The menu has changed a lot this last year.  I went in really looking forward to having their veggie burger.  Gone.  Kaput.  I ordered some sort of weird salad thing with mozzarella cheese and pesto.  WAY over-priced.  The rest of my party (meat eaters) were not impressed anymore either.  That will be our last visit.
0,"Stay away from this company they cheat you on your unit size. They do the switch and bait on you. There units are not the size they represent in the add's or on the internet. There answer to customer service is you saw the unit and its your problem you didnt measure the actual unit, they represent and advertise one size  but give you a unit that that is much smaller then you actuall get, This company is very dishonst and not customer friendly."
3,"The one in Gilbert has very good service, they staff is great. The chicken noodle soup is good but a lot of salt, noddles and little veggies and chicken.\nThe best is the Wild Flower Salad, yummy."
3,"So excited to have Wood Creations in Vegas!  Cute wood designs, helpful staff."
4,"Several months ago I had dandruff that WOULD NOT go away. I followed the recommendations of my hair dresser, dermatologist, massage therapist, manicurist, boyfriend, best friend and multiple internet sites. NOTHING worked - I tried every shampoo, oil, powder and lotion. Every method from cold rinses to deep conditioning to tea tree oil treatments. All to no avail. Needless to say, I was reaching the end of my rope and the height of embarrassment.  I've always been the girl among my friends with the best hair! It's long, thick, with just a hint of wave, and a perfect texture - but with dandruff, I lost that title.\n\nTHEN I stopped in my favorite store (WHY didn't I think of this FIRST?!), and discovered \""Hair Doctor\"" mask. One treatment and I had dandruff-free hair for two weeks! Another treatment when it started coming back, and in two months I haven't had one speck of dandruff.\n\nHave a problem? Go to Lush, they can solve any problem!"
0,"I wanted to love this restaurant..., I truly did because I heard Jose Andres was the Chef owner and as a DC resident I love anything Jose Andres!! One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/"
1,"You are better off going to T.G.I. Fridays for the food.  The price of the food for the quality is not worth. I ordered the Hand Stretched Grilled Flatbread, it took over a hour to get it after placing the order. The server was ok but he had four tables that placed orders as well. That took longer to serve. He never acknowledge that fact of the matter. \n\nIf your are a tourist coming to Vegas, by all means check out the venue, bar, & gift shop. If your are dining in the restaurant prepare for a high bill, ok  food, & mediocre service."
1,"Yelp let us down this time.  I debated between 1 and 2 stars but settled on 2 because the steak (reason we came here) was good.  Ambiance was OK but we made a reservation and were seated in the bar area.  This was annoying.  Another couple sat down next to us and complained about it and were re-seated at a table.  So I guess if you complain they give you a better table?  The restaurant wasn't full (7PM on a Saturday night), so I'm not sure why we were seated in the bar area with a reservation.  \n\nAppetizers: We got shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque soup.  Soup was good, big chunks of lobster in it, shrimp coctail was good but size of shrimp was very small considering the price.  \n\nWe ordered all of our food when we sat down and told our waitress that we were in a hurry and were very hungry, so please bring the food as fast as possible.  We then waited an hour for our steaks.  I didn't like how the menu had two options for steaks - grilled or roasted, the roasted was 20% more and our waitress offered very little information about the difference between the two.  Here is my take - I don't know what is the best way to cook a steak - I think the restaurant should have their method and sell it as the best method.  We ordered one of each thinking we could try each others to see the difference.  Unfortunately, the waitress brought us two of the same steaks and when we figured out they weren't what we ordered, there was no offer to bring another one, or anything other than a meek apology from our waitress. \n\nSteaks were good, but mine was luke warm, like it had been sitting for 15 minutes warm.  \n\nGot the broccolini and gratin potato for sides, both were very good.  \n\nEach had a glass of the house Pino and was good but pricey @ $17 / glass.  \n\nOrdered the apple vanilla crisp for desert and it was fantastic but way overpriced @ $15.  \n\nTotal before tip was $250.  Very disappointing experience, much better options on the strip, not sure how this place got such high marks."
4,Really good drinks and good food! Very fun place to go out and hang out!
0,"I would have given this place 2 out of 5 stars for comfortable and clean atmosphere, having all the NFL games on, and being close to home. BUT they changed the game we were watching when in over time 5 times! Each time, they were really rude about it saying \""we are working on it\"" and \""there you go\"" with attitude. The problem could have been that we were here for 4 hours and had already tipped over 20% on our $60 bill so they just didn't care how they treated us, but not the best way to end game day.\nOther than that, the food was cold and mediocre and didn't fit the menu descriptions. The mixed drinks weren't very good, and neither was the draft craft beer. No refills on the water or soda with out asking. This is the second time we have been here with so so food and service. Due to the TV incidents and rude response, I would rather drive farther than come back."
1,"i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews Joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise). \n\nambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. \nthe wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. \n\nthe food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the filet mignon i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from the shell before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place the shell on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the filet mignon and King Crab Legs. we were \""sold\"" that they were HUGE legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.\ngiven that i have had true alaskan king crab legs before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?\n\nas we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, stone crabs, filet mignon with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better."
3,"I don't get some of these poor reviews.  The decor is spare but attractive, the place seems clean enough to me, the prices are good, and I've never had a bad meal there over the past 20 years.  My current favorite is the mussels, either ginger-and-onion  or black-bean.  The mussels are big and plump and plentiful, nicely presented and piping hot.  My friends have liked their dishes, too.  I've had worse Chinese food (including in China), but seldom better.  Just wish I lived closer, but I can always make an excuse to travel to a place I like as much as GHHK."
4,I have to say their food is awesome!
4,"What a great company and great customer service. Placed an order a couple days ago online, and it got to me in 3 days. There was a mix-up with the size of the juice I ordered so I emailed them and within 1 hr I had an email back from the postal service saying the replacement was on its way. Super impressed. Highly recommend this establishment. :)"
1,"Usually enjoyable, but valentines day menu sucked, so i ordered off the taste menu and the portion sizes were appropriate for a 3 year old. Went there expecting duck and gnoche, left with empty wallet and empty stomach."
0,Used these guys last year 2012 and they were great...called them a few weeks ago for appt and first day they were a no show and didn't calk until 4pm to say sorry and setup appt for next day...next day they were no show again and never called. Never returned our calls either and never heard from again. Not sure if new mgmt now but thats horrible service
4,"If you're looking for a delicious Phoenix feast, head to one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, Havana Cafe.\n\nI always try a little bit of everything when I'm at the Cuban restaurant, and when my pal and I went this week, our meal was no exception. We had more than 10 different menu items peppering our table, and we both left stuffed and happy. Like it is for me, Havana Cafe instantly became one of his favorite restaurants after one meal there.\n\nOne of the coolest things about Havana Cafe is that there are mojito making classes offered there periodically. I've attended one and loved it, and the mojitos at Havana Cafe are amazing. \n\nWhen we went to dinner this week, we got a pitcher of sangria instead of mojitos, because sangria is another one of my favorite drinks. The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor, and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes.\n\nLet's start first with my favorite dish at Havana Cafe, the Frituras de Frijoles Negros ($5.25). They're bite-sized black bean fritters served with a cool and creamy avocado dip that is to-die-for. I love, love, love this dish and could eat it all the time.\n\nThe Maduros Fritos ($5.95) are just as amazing. They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment. If you don't like eating raw bananas, you'll probably still love these.\n\nWe also had vegetable empanaditas ($6.95), mini-pies chock full of veggies. For being such little appetizer treats, they're really filling and could make a great main course for vegetarians.\n\nI also had the Potage de Frijoles Negros ($4.95 for a bowl), which is a vegetarian black bean soup that is also very hearty. It's so tasty!\n\nMy companion got the San Juan Combination ($16.95), a massive sampler plate that lets you taste seven different dishes-a Puerto Rican tamale, plantains and pork, a vegetable croquette, twice-fried plantains, peas cooked with rice and pork, fried pork and beans and rice. The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers, they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you.\n\nBesides the phenomenal food, I love Phoenix's Havana Cafe for its intimate setting. The restaurant is comprised of a little dining room with mirrored walls, and there's also a patio. It's not quite Cuba, but the aromas and warm, welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation."
3,If i could give a 3.5 start I would but between a 3 and 4.. I'll lean towards a 4. Prices are reasonable for getting food on the strip... the sandwhich I got was wayyy too salty and don't get me wrong I love salty food.. but apparently even this got my pallet questioning the level of saltiness.. \n\nIt's a good  place to go grab a quick bite.  I'll come back again and give it another go.....
0,"Enormous Portions!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe reason for giving one star is simple, i felt guilty eating here because i thought of all the waste this restaurant produces and it made me sad. Enough food in one dish to feed three people. It really is terrible how much food is thrown away. For this reason alone i will not support a business that wastes as much as this one. On the other hand the food was delicious, and our waiter was great."
1,"I went in to Beyond Baggage, in the Paradise Valley Mall, today looking for a luggage tag. No one was in the store. I was also window shopping, looking for a replacement of my trusty carry-on bag. The bags that would fit the bill were all pretty pricey. \n\nWhen  asked for some help, it was like I was talking to a pillar. The fellow behind the counter couldn't have been less helpful.\n\nI asked if he had any luggage tags, He said no. When I browsed around the store, in fact, there were some hanging on the back side of a display right in the center of the floor.\n\nI took this item, marked $3.50,  to the counter. The man handed me two singles back as change. This store employee couldn't have cared less. His service didn't even rise to the level of \""awful.\"" \n\nThey'll never see me again."
3,"I'm sorry I'm getting around to this review just as the habitat is about to close.  I spent much time watching the lions play with their trainers or gnaw of the large play balls they have in the habitat.\n\nAlthough they are in captivity behind plexiglas, I always find looking at big cats to be relaxing and great fun!\n\nI will miss this habitat when MGM folds it and replaces it.  It's just one more free thing that will be gone from the Strip."
1,"Fun atmosphere, visually stimulating. Tons of things to look at.\nA good mix of restaurants and watering holes. Checking in and out was a breeze.\nThe problem I have is about security. On the second night sometime shortly after 1:30 there was a jiggling at are door. There was a dude putting in door card trying to enter. We called the desk and said they would notify security. Meanwhile this guys trying other doors down the hall. 15 minutes later we call the desk again! In the meanwhile he comes back to our door and is shuffling through a handful of door cards to find one that might work. We yell through the door at the punk a few times to no avail. Security shows up 5 minutes later and confronts the guy. We opened our door to say that's the dude and were told by security that they got it. There was no further contact with security or the desk. So we were left in the dark to what was happening. Scarey\nSecurity at the elevators like other resorts is a good thing after midnight."
3,"Good but not the best.\n\nWe had a large party which is understandable why our food delivery times were long but overall meal time we were there for almost three hours.\n\nTuna tartare I wasn't a fan, caesar salad was good, japanese A5 was great - smooth and buttery as it should be, truffle mac and cheese was good as was the flat cracker-like bread which was served pre-apps.\n\nAlthough humorous, slightly annoying--a waitress (not sure if she was actually a waitress or extra help) poured my boyfriends beer into a glass standing straight up....the entire glass was full of foamy head, he actually had to tell the girl that he could handle it and waited a few minutes for the foam to disappear to pour the beer properly."
3,"This is a fabulous market if you are looking for asian products.  The meat department is varied with almost any meat you can think of conventional or not.  The pricing on conventional items such as chicken or steak or short ribs (which was I was looking for) is competitive with your neighborhood supermarket.  The bargains are in the exotic meats such as beef heart, chicken feet (yum in chicken soup!), tripe, cow feet (makes a great soup), etc.  I will tell you that I was impressed with the cleanliness of the meat and fish department.  There was ABSOLUTELY no smell coming from meat market which is unusual.  Most meat depts have some kind of odor.  This speaks to how clean they keep the place.  I just bought a huge bottle of soy sauce for 1.88.  Rice, even brown rice, is dirt cheap.  the produce had some bargains such as ginger for 1.99 a lb.  It's 3 dollars or more in other places.  I didn't give it a 5 star rating because there is no English in the aisle signs so people like me couldn't find everything thereby cutting my shopping short.  I am sure I would have shopped more if I could figure out where everything was.\nThere is small eating establishment in the front but the food in the trays didn't look so fresh when I was shopping there at 7PM.  I saw groups of asians eating there so the food must be good.\nGive it a try.  It's a fascinating place."
4,"I agree with the previous review from Sarah about the sizing etc... I know that VS has been notable for good measuring and quality.  I was totally impressed by the recent visit I made at the town square location.  I went in later than I had hoped, regardless Liz attended to my needs very quick and professionally.  I have worked retail before and I know that the typical closing procedure is very critical for time management. because, I went in an hour before their closing, I didn't think I was going to treated with high quality service. lol. I liked Liz's demeanor and tactic.  honestly, the past front end clerks have not really impressed me, even though I know they have a expectations/goals to meet, in the past they have been a little on the pushy side.\nSo, if you do go in please be more patient with the floor staff, because they are not just putting up with you but cleaning up after the sloths, yes... the unorganized gals that just pop in for a freebie and make a mess!  definitely, ask for deals and get on their mailing list! I got a birthday credit recently and that made me happy.  I am not sure why the cell service sux in there, but I do like that they accommodated my mum with a chair while I was in the fitting room.  Thanks to Liz and your coworkers!"
0,"Worst brunch ever. Moldy fruit, cold soggy pancakes, dried out salmon, and dried out pasta. Disgusting. There are a lot of great brunch places in Pittsburgh and this is not one of them."
4,"I eat at this specific Rubio's very frequently and I'm never disappointed. I absolutely love eating here.\n\nThe food is not the most amazing food you will ever eat but it is above par. It is also not extremely expensive so it is definitely worth it.\n\nAfter the first two times going there, they remembered my name and the chefs knew our order and started cooking when they saw our car. Even when they are busy, our food is ready in very little time. And not bad for being so quick.\n\nIt's close to home and has good service and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"This place offered great customer service. My wife went to the location in Laveen at 5 minutes before 6 and they told her they didn't have time to help her before closing. Then they locked the door on her. She went to this location and they fixed her tire for free, since the other place was so rude."
4,"We went back to Montti Tax Service for a second year in a row. Ivano remembered us, asked how everything had been, and took care of everything with quickness. We were in and out in about an hour. This is despite not making it to his office until nearly April 15th. Whoops.\n\nVery glad to have a competent tax professional to help us figure everything out. \n\nWhen asked questions about different tax rules, breaks, etc, Ivano was very honest and thorough in his responses.\n\nWill be going back next year, for the third year in a row."
4,"I have been going for 8 years to this sushi place.  I now live in Laveen and drive to come out to this restaurant.\n\nThe happy hour is amazing, the quality of the sushi is pretty damn good and I love the rolls. Try the mochi if you haven't and the Las Vegas roll is my favorite, even if its fried and covered in cream cheese. \n\nJust try to avoid going when the comedy club upstairs is having a show.  Zilch in terms of parking.\n\nLove it!"
0,The staff here were vultures. They kept sending different people after me to try to talk me into something I wasn't asking for and didn't want. I wouldn't even consider going back. People like that need to find different jobs because they are giving dealerships and car brands a bad name.
1,"I got the ahi sliders and they had a lot of inedible sinew in the them...yuck.  The server was very friendly and attentive, but surprisingly unconcerned about the poor quality of my fish.  My dining partners had the tempeh and turkey burger and enjoyed their selections."
3,"WHERE:  Located inside the Caesar's Palace Hotel/Casino (near the lobby where they shot a scene from the movie The Hangover, haha).\n\nWHEN: It is one fine dining restaurant that is actually 24 hours! Pretty convenient, huh?\n\nWHY: If you are out and about, stranded on the strip somewhere, or would just like some tasty dessert!\n\nWHAT:  My friend and I came directly here and strictly for dessert.  As a first-timer, I would say the venue is real simple and elegant. I am a big time dessert-nut, so I got to pick 2 and my friend and I shared.\n\nCreme br\u00fbl\u00e9e- This has to be one of the best I've tasted so far! Its presentation and yumminess were both hits, and no misses!\n\nNapolean- I am seriously in love with napoleon desserts. This is the best in the entire west! Don't let its looks deceive you! It looks ginormous when they bring it out, but it is seriously made out of air! Try it! If you don't like it, call me so I can eat the rest, please and thanks! haha.\n\nThere was another time last week where my cousins and I wanted to indulge in dessert, and this is the place that popped into my head. It was late night, so I didn't think the menu would change.. (My excitedness level was through the roof)... When I looked through the menu, my excitedness level decreased! There were seriously only 3 or 4 desserts on the menu... which didn't sound too appealing to me. So we ended up just leaving for another spot. Sucks!\n\nHopefully they switch it around and have the same desserts during the day, for 24 hours! So until then, I have my fingers crossed."
3,"This was a really cute and cozy tasting room that was really hard to find! I was determined, though, to find it because of the Yelp check-in offer. They had a nice wine selection, the guy working there wasn't pushy, and I enjoyed a quiet hour sipping on wine. I hope this place stays in business because it is a relaxing spot to enjoy wine."
2,"This is another entry from the Fox Restaurant Concepts folks. Typically, I find their restaurants to be a bit over-priced, over-hyped and uninspired. The prices here are better, for sure, but the menu is still....eh....blah. I sat and stared at it for an hour before we headed over and I truthfully wasn't that interested in eating anything on the menu. It's not that creative and healthy is a bit lacking. However, that being said, the staff is wonderful, and what they do have the menu, they do well.\n\nI wish their happy hour went until 7 but that's alright, the wine and beer list is extensive and the prices are fair. I don't know that I would pay what they were asking for their cocktails, though. My husband had the chicken hash which was exactly as described and was a pretty good, authentic hash. I would love if they used Yukon golds or red potatoes instead of russets since russets tend to get a little mealy but the flavors were good. I had the artichoke salad and had grilled chicken added to it no problem. This was very good, very light and very large! I got a dinner, a snack and a lunch out of this. The veggies are very, very thinly sliced so you get very subtle hints of the endive and the asparagus as well as the artichokes and the dressing is a nice, light, vinegar and oil (I'm thinking cider vinegar based on a subtle sweetness). We did have the soft prezel appetizer which was good. I would prefer them to change their presentation on this one, though. The fondue put is far too large for the amount of cheese they give you (the amount of cheese is fine) but it looks silly reaching down to the bottom of the oversized pot. The melted provolone had a lovely texture, was not lumpy or thick and was a perfect compliment to the sea-salted pretzel bites. We split it amongst three and didn't finish it all. \n\nOverall, ambiance is good, staff is friendly, service is quick and the food is decent. I just wish the menu had a little more oomph or something that made you go \""Oh! I HAVE to try that!!\"" I wouldn't come back here on my own but if a friend suggested it again as happened last night, I wouldn't say no."
4,by far THE BEST tacos i've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\ni first tried tacos el gordo in san diego and i was relieved to find out that it was just the same at this location!!! tacos with al pastor! MMM MMM MMM DELISH :) oh! and also try their tostadas!!\n\nwarning: this place can get extremely crowded and it doesnt help that this place is freaggin small! there are different lines for different tacos and the cashier is on the opposite side of the room...its an awkward set up for sure but bare with it because it's really worth it :)
3,"ENVY was the best meal we had in Vegas.  We both ordered the Signature Tasting Entree:  Filet Mignon, Braised Beef Cheeks, Sea Bass, and Crab Victoria.  The beef cheeks made us nervous, but turned out to be excellent.  Very rich.  The sea bass was average (Bonefish's is better!) the filet was good as well, although the bearnaise was ice cold when we were served, and by the time some lukewarm bearnaise came, my steak had lost all warmth.  (And PS - I know that you can't make bearnaise too hot!)  The crab victoria I don't remember because I was on my third glass of wine :-)  Also, enjoyed a mix-and-match flight of wine for $12.  The service was shotty, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5.  ENVY was a good experience all-in-all."
2,"Great service. Good bar food. Interesting \""regulars\""...liked the fact that there was pool tables."
2,"Excellent lunch, I like the place and will come back.  Had a salad and it was memorable.  Can recommend."
1,"It's pouring with rain. It's 11pm. It's Sunday. We just wanted somewhere for a quick late night supper.\n\nThe first place we came across that was still open was Bar Napoli. Judging from the exterior and the d\u00e9cor inside, we assumed we wouldn't be treated to anything near haute cuisine - this place has a feel about it that suggests you're going to get average-to-ok food. And the menu is super-scarily-ridiculously long. They can't possibly prepare all those meals!\n\nWith this in mind, we opted two very simple dishes - ones that ought to be very hard to get wrong. And it was perfectly fine. Sure, the pizza was a bit bready, and perhaps our pesto pasta was just a touch on the oily side, but it really was a better option than the late night 'eateries' around the corner offering kebabs. \n\nSurprisingly pleasant. Wouldn't think of coming here for an actual dinner though, but for a very late night supper, it's about right."
3,"Cute froyo shop near home. My favorites are the coconut and the pineapple. I was super excited when I saw taro, but was disappointed when I got a taste. It is tart and I personally think taro shouldn't be tart.  Anyway, the pineapple is amazing and I'll just stick with that.\n\nThey have lots of unique toppings, including different flavored bobas. They aren't really bobas, more like round balls shaped like boba that burst with juice when you pop them. I usually steer clear of those and goes straight for the mochi. They also offer the usual fresh fruit, candies, chocolates, cereals, nuts and etc... Price is comparable to all other self serve yogurt shops."
2,"The food was pretty good and if you get here early enough the wait isn't too bad. They can get really busy for breakfast, so come early. We had a coupon, so look out for those."
4,Flame food. Definitely the best spot off breakfast on campus hands down and arguably the best place to eat from 2-10 am \n\nWaitresses are always quick and friendly and food always comes out promptly and delicious.
1,"Oh Don, you're hanging on by the thinnest little thread. A few years back, this would have been 5 glowing stars. What happened?\n\nI mean, I know a lot happened, you opened, then you closed, then you opened under a different name in a new location, then you opened back up in the old location. But the most important thing is you're back! And we were excited that you were back! You were the best! You offered great food at a decent price. Service was never your forte, but it was at least bearable. We brought people from many miles away to your restaurant because you were that good. On a lazy Saturday night we ordered your food and rented a movie and considered it a \""perfect\"" night. On Fathers Day we brought Pops by to enjoy the lunch special because that's what he wanted...but things have changed...\n\nSo we came back, after so many years of loyalty there was no doubt that we'd be back. In the interim we hit up Mama D's and the food was great, tasted just like Don's. This time around, in the old, but new venue we ordered our traditional favorites. #1 on the list was the Fettuccine Carbonara. Back then, the sauce was better than some of the finer dining options in this city. So the excitement to eat this bowl of awesomeness was brewing. My frown was not turned upside down though. It was bad. Bad in nearly every possible way. The sauce was flat, tasted nothing like the \""olden days.\"" The bread prior to the meal became tasteless breadsticks. Gone are the days of Oil & Vinegar at the table. The meatball calzone we ordered had 6x's the amount of ricotta cheese to the mozzarella that was in there. The service was bad. It took a while to get a drink order in, then another 15 minutes to get salads, then another 30 minutes to get entrees. This was on a Friday night when the place wasn't even a 1/4 full. \n\nSomething has changed. The meal felt effortless, and that more than anything is what bothers me most. I don't know if the challenging ways of today's economy has gotten the best of ol' Don Antonio and his famous recipes, or if a new chef was hired, or what the heck happened. But whatever it is, I want the old Don Antonio's back, and I want it now! Do it right, or don't do it at all. This should be a one star review but Don has some street cred with me. I hope Don Antonio's returns to it's old glory, otherwise this guy is riding off into the sunset never to return again."
0,"My husband was after me to try this restaurant, somehow i never got a good feel about it... but we finally tried, hated the food. everything tasted bad... some strange sweet svory taste that was not good. we just ate whatever we could and hurried out of there."
1,"Walked in on a thurs night and it was not busy whatsoever. A friend and I were the only ones seated in the actual restaurant area while there were about several others already eating/drinking at the bar. Food took literally 35 minutes, let me remind you, we were the only ones in the seating area of the restaurant. Expecting it to be AMAZING considering the wait time, instead left very disappointed. \n\nTonkatsu: skimped portions\nMarinated beef: tasted and looked like simple ground hamburger, nothing special \nCurry: prob the best thing on the plate; but was quite skimped as well \n\nNot to mention, food came out cold. Save your time and goto Zenn curry. Sry Kaba, I don't thjnk I will be back again!"
1,"Came here for my birthday which was on a Wednesday in March. The weather was beautiful and breezy. There were some people but there were many open tables so we got right in. We also brought our little dog since we planned to go hiking after and wanted to bring her. It was nice to find a place to bring your four legged friend! Anyways, the first thing we noticed was the self serve coffee, water and lemonade. We actually liked this idea! The only thing that I had an issue with is that they don't mention that there is a charge for the lemonade. They really should have a sign or something that mentions this. While looking over the menu, we noticed that the trees above us kept shedding leaves which we really were not excited about getting into our meals when they arrived. The waitress was really nice and moved an umbrella over to shield us a little from the greenage dropping into our food. \nI decided on the monti cristo (over easy eggs, ham, and swiss cheese sandwiched between french toast with maple syrup) and my husband chose the cheese omelet with home fries. The monti cristo was soooo good. The only issue was that I noticed pieces of paper packaging still on my ham. It wasn't very much but it was a bit irritating having to peel little pieces of paper off of my ham! My husband was not impressed with his meal at all. He said the cheese on the omelet was nothing more than velveeta, the biscuit served with his meal was grainy and tough, and the home fries were not very flavorful. \nThe prices were pretty high for breakfast and my husband said his breakfast didn't even fill him up. \nAfter breakfast, we walked around the farm a bit which was cool. The only thing we noticed was that there were no signs up next to each crop stating what they were. I would have liked to know what each was. \nTo sum it up, it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere and I was happy that I could bring my little doggie. However, I didn't feel it was worth the price and being the fattie that I am, I really don't like to have distractions from eating my meals (leaves falling in my food, packaging on my ham...). I don't think we would go back unless our dogs wanted to go our for breakfast. Haha"
0,rockin brunch?...epic fail. We tried the rockin brunch today and considering the other choices in the area for breakfast I would never come here for breakfast again. The music was way too loud for a breakfast and after asking three times to have the music turned down we figured they just were not going to do it despite the fact that they said they would. The food was average at best. Would recommend Liberty Market or Farmhouse for breakfast instead.
4,"Perfect from start to finish.  I wanted to wait a few months and make sure everything was done as expected.  We did a layover my current asphalt shingle roof.  Jared came out, walked me through the whole process and why Lyons would be happy to do this job.  I made it very clear that I was going to have multiple quotes done and he gave me some great tips and questions to ask.  After that whole process they were a bit higher than most (about $1000).  After a conversation with Jared he was able to make the number fit a bit better.  My concern was quality over price and I made that very clear to all roofers who came out for an inspection/estimate.  They came out on time to start the job.  The crew was very informative and courteous.  The job took about 2 days longer than anticipated....BUT, I wasn't going to be home, and it was my roof.  It could have taken them a month and it wouldn't have hurt my feelings.  When I got home from my trip I had a new roof, new ridge top vent, new chimney cover, painted roof fixtures, and a new ac unit put back exactly as it should have been.  Yard was spotless as well.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.  Another very deciding factor, was they would handle any and all insurance clams due to hail, rain, or wind.  That's really important as those things are common here in Arizona.  Piece of mind, from a great LOCAL company, that follows that up with great work!"
1,"Le Creperie du Marche has a lot of options, including sweet and savoury, meaty and vegan. I went sweet for a crepe stuffed with chocolate, bananas, and local strawberries. The strawberries were tasty, but ultimately the crepe needed a sprinkle of sea salt or anything else that could make it less one note. I wanted to love it, but I just kind of liked it."
3,"I love this La Pomponnee wayyyyy more than the peters township one. It's less cluttered and everyone is really friendly.\n\nMy stylist is Jessica and I can't say enough good things about her. I think she is one of their junior stylists but she gives a great haircut! She actually listens and she doesn't push products on you. However I loved how she styled my hair so I ended up buying everything she used because I needed products and you know I have seen a huge difference in my hair. \nShe even told me some cute ways to style my hair which is great for me cause my hair is a pain! \n\nI spent around $100 on products and for a haircut, wash, blow dry and style was $30 which is a great price! But the haircut prices vary by stylist.\n\nNow this is why they lose a star .. I got my hair highlighted here last summer and no my girl Jess didnt do them! Since it was summer I asked for partial highlights and I didn't get my haircut cause I used a groupon at another salon to get it cut. I was charged $85 for my partial highlights which I thought was a little expensive just for that! They did look great and the stylist listened to what I wanted which was great but they faded really really fast. Yes I know it was summer but I also did buy the 2 products that are supposed to help prevent that. But oh it happens.\n\nAlso Mindy is great for waxing! She is quick, friendly and makes you feel really comfortable. Her prices are great too. \n\nTry it out and ask for Mindy or Jess you won't be disappointed!"
4,"So I was looking at my in-room dining options and most of the items I have been eyeing were mostly Italian based. And I figured, I might as well order delivery than to pay $40 for one meal. \n\nI logged onto yelp, browsed around a little and made my decision to order from this place. I called in to ask a few questions and although they seemed to be in a rush, they were super friendly. I'm guessing that's because they were busy, which I know understand fully why. \n\nThe delivery took an hour and half, and they don't deliver to your room. I had to go downstairs to the taxi line to pick it up from a friendly gentleman in a grey fiat. Brownie points for cutest car ever. I mean right? Got my Italian food delivered in a cute ass Italian car. How great is that.\n\nAnyways, aside from that the food was great. I made the order online on yelp for:\n\nBuffalo chicken wings and fries \ncheese garlic bread\nSpaghetti with meatballs\nCaesar salad with grilled chicken\nAnd cheesecake for dessert \n\nEverything was fantastic. Spaghetti was a little soggy from the delivery and it was very saucy, but I know delivery foods aren't straight from the kitchen so that's not a complaint at all. The cheese garlic bread and grilled chicken on the salad was my favorite. My bf is allergic to cheese and he still ate it. \n\nTotal came out to be about $39 including tax, delivery, and tip. \nOn side note, if I had to order all of this for in dining it would've been $89 before taxes and fees. lol yay for saving forty bucks! For food that was scrumptious!"
0,"The service is terrible, the food is terrible and price is terrible. I wouldn't have came here if I didn't get a complimentary meal from the hotel. The tomato bisque was sour. The bread was hard. I could go on.. The sliders that I order were cold, and the appetizer platter was extremely salty. Too much msg maybe? On top of that, it took forever trying to get the server because the place is so dimly lit.. I'm never coming back again, even if its free.\n\nDo not recommend this restaurant to anyone.."
3,"Very good quality fish here.  The owners were very nice and accommodating.  They offered to special order any type of fish I desired.  They also invited me back the following night for some off the menu sushi another customer had special ordered.\n\nThey also offer fresh wasabi which you have to try if you have never had it, you wont go back to the fake green horseradish junk they serve elsewhere."
2,"I registered here a while back. I never been so overwhelmed. Even with my mom, looking at the walls of paci's and bottles was wow. I didn't know the difference between them all,yet, there was so many to choose from. Then you get to the big items: cribs, strollers, carseats. Not a whole lot to choose from. Baby tub, nursery decor, matresses, and changing pads had a small selection as well. They are good everywhere else though. I walked out and went strait home to lay down, I think I only registered for 30 things haha. I was told I am going to need a lot more though eek."
1,"This was a horrible hotel for the following reasons: (1) cigarette smoke everywhere--even in the nonsmoking rooms, (2) courtyard rooms are horrible--stay in the tower, (3) house keeping either gave me no towels or only one, (4) food was disgusting no matter where you purchased it from, (5) must pay extra for WiFi, and (6) lobby is very barren--no place to sit while waiting for others in your party.\n\nThis place did not meet our expectations at all."
4,"Amazing service.  Ken, the owner, kept my friends and me laughing the entire time we were here on our last leg of vacation.  The food was fresh and delicious. I would make it a point to come back here next time I am out in Vegas because of my experience."
3,"Im not sure there is much of a difference in the small and large plates. Maybe they just meant the size of the plate. \n\nThe sea bass and the hamachi were both very tasty. Pork sliders - not good.  The bread tasted old and it wasnt even hot.  Risotto was made perfectly if you like it  rich and creamy.\n\nIf you want the autographed copy of Hubert's book, $25!"
1,"I went to this place to use a Groupon and because I miss the food from Hawaii (well..some of it anyway). The food here was pretty typical of a fast food place, not very fresh and the meat was very poor quality and fatty. I got the curry chicken and the BF got the bbq beef. They were pretty meh. I also have tried the veggie noodle soup which was probably the best thing I have had here. It was not 'good' but it was better for sure. I probably wouldn't go back."
4,"We hired Randy to get the carpet and grout cleaning in our house.He came over on a very short notice and was very friendly and helpful. We called his previous employer, who was busy and referred him to us and we are glad we got the carpet and floor cleaned by him. He is very patient, reasonable and knowledgeable. Not too expensive. \nIf you are first time home buyer, you can try this guy and you wont regret it."
0,"My inner-nerd was excited to hear about NTN Buzztime and team trivia so I was stoked to come down and try this place out.  \n\nI wasn't stoked, however, to learn that NTN and team trivia were two different things.  And I wasn't stoked to wait 10 minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table.\n\nRegardless, this place's parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with Thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints.  Aside from the pool table and shuffleboard, as if that alone wasn't awesome enough - they have FOOZBALL too!!\n\nThe food and service was pretty average. I ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile  sandwich with Monterey jack cheese.  It tasted pretty bland - I ate only half, which if you know me, means it must have been pretty blah.  The fries were the zesty seasoned variety - probably frozen, but were still pretty good.  Rum and cokes here were standard as well.  Glasses were shorter than expected, but neither too weak, nor too strong. \n\nNow to the trivia.  It's team driven and can go kind of slow.  So the bigger the group at the table, the more brainpower (but also, the more likely for differing answers and arguments).  For my friend and I, who thought we were at a disadvantage - we coasted to 3rd place (out of 10).  Not too bad, and we won a gift certificate back to Hazelwoods.  I'll use it someday I'm sure.  Like when I'm in the neighborhood or something.  Not in a big rush. \n\nP.S.  It was Grover who was on the cover of Sesame Street Fever, in case you're wondering.\n\nEDIT: 11/07\nOk, I'm downgrading to a one-star review, which is for the understaffed Saturday when I went to watch Big-Ten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate.  One server to about 30 people in the entire restaurant portion.  To add insult to injury, I paid with a $10 GC and left a $2 tip for an $8 lunch and the server chased me out when I left and couldn't wait any longer.  Service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for."
3,"Nice atmosphere, right uptown. Great spot for pizza in Charlotte! (They also have good wings)"
4,"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley.  They offer far spicier options than other Thai restaurants in the area and everything was extremely flavorful and fresh.  I do think Cha Da Thai is a couple dollars more expensive than others (check my other Thai restaurant reviews), but it's completely worth it.\nA nice bonus: Cha Da Thai has the most Thai ambiance/decor of any of the Thai restaurants that I've been too."
2,"I decided to write this review because I do not really like the direction the store started taking recently. \n\nIt used to be a very good place to buy photo equipment. \nI will not cover all aspects of buying the equipment here, but I will concentrate on the subject that bothers me.\n\nPurchasing a photo equipment is a complicated thing by itself.\nPrice of owning photo equipment includes not only the price tag you will pay at the store, but also, warranties, returns, exchanges and maintenance among other things.\n\nLet me concentrate on the lens business photoservice.ca is conducting.\nTheir lens price policy is one of the best around.  \nThey have Price Match button, which guarantees that you will get the best price for the lens which is great. QST at 9.5% is not helping much, you know, but the price before taxes is really good, no questions asked. \nThe problem comes if for whatever reason you decide to return the lens whether it is a tight zoom ring or circumstances had changed for you and you have to return the lens. \nTheir on-line return policy stands the following: \nTaken from http://photoservice.ca/ENGLISH/return_and_exchange_policy.asp\n\n------------------------- OFFICIAL RETURN POLICY FROM WEBSITE --------------------\nReturns:\n\nReturns and exchanges are accepted within fourteen (14) days of purchase.\n\nThe equipment must be in its original condition, with the manufacturer's packaging and all the included items at the moment of the purchase. Photo Service Lted reserves the right to apply restocking fees of a minimum of 10% if the packaging or any item is damaged or missing.\nThe equipment must be verified and approved by a Photo Service Lted sales representative for the return/exchange to be accepted. \n-------------------------- END OF ON-LINE SECTION --------------------------------------------\n\nThis policy is pretty much standard and understandable.\nNow when you actually purchase the lens on your purchase documentation at the very bottom you may or may not notice a completely different policy\n\n---------------------------- PRINTED ON THE PURCHASED DOCUMENTS-----------\nAucune exception.\nFrais de re-intreposage de 5% a 20% sur tous les retours et echanges.\n\n(this means - no exception. Cost of returns or exchanges is 5 to 20% for all purchased or exchanged items )\n---------------------------END-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, when you will be shopping at the store, be very careful if you have any doubt that you may have to return the item. \nNow why you will be charged 5 or 20%? I tried to figure it out and there are no rules, it's all done at the discretion of the person handling the returns. But one thing I know for sure - even if the item is returned in impeccable condition, not even being taken from the box - first time they will charge you 5%, but if return from your account will happen again - your restocking fee will go up.\nThe way they explained me is that they are loosing money because it's like RENTING this equipment to you. \n( They may also mention to you that they are loosing money because you paid with Visa card and it cost them money to do Visa processing, oh-la-la)\n\nOverall, I will be looking for on-line purchases for my future purchases."
4,"The food and the service here is awesome. Expect a wait... Even for bar seating.\n\nI had the pork belly in a steamed bun and the broccoli with fried cheese curd. Both were incredible. I have eaten pork belly quite a few times at other restaurants, and I can easily say that this is the best I've ever had."
2,"A good place to take coworkers or other people you'd like to make uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, you should know to go there on Friday and Saturday nights because that's when the good-looking dancers are there. Anyone who's been in a strip club off-hours knows what that's like.  And for god's sake bring cash, unless you want to be fingerprinted, you derelict."
3,"So i've recently added Red Rock to my rotation of casinos i frequent.  It's the 2nd closest casino to my house.  Some of it's features:\n\nGaming - my guess is this is the largest \""local\"" casino - machines 'o plenty, table area is kinda on the small size compared to the rest of the casino.  The craps tables are decent - 10x odds and the fire bet. Also, $5 craps and BJ tables.  Decent comps and giveaways.  They have one of the nicest Bingo rooms in the valley.\n\nFood - nice selection of restaurants and one of the better food courts.  My favs: lbs - one of the better burger restaurants in Vegas; Yardhouse - big surprise, great beer selection, decent food; Hachi - great selection of japanese food - a little pricey; i've yet to try terra rosa.  In the food court - i frequent fatburger and capriotti's.  Sadly, the buffet has gone downhill over the years.\n\nEntertainment - Movie Theatre is great but very busy on the weekends; they have some decent concerts within the outdoor venue;  I've yet to try the bowling alley.\n\nHotel rooms - surprisingly, i've yet to do  staycation here - some day ....\n\nThey have tons of parking, easy access from the 215 fwy."
1,"Don't expect a lot.  The animals all looked healthy and well taken care of.  small place, only took me a few minutes to see the whole park."
3,"This is a lovely baby furniture store tucked away in an unassuming location in a strip mall.  To be honest, if I hadn't looked up the place on line, I would never have noticed it from the street.  The store is immaculate, organized and easy to maneuver.  They offer a wide variety of baby furniture, strollers, car seats and the like.  I walked in and was instantly greeted by a friendly employee. He asked what I was looking for and led me directly to the item.  The service was great, as was the selection.  Now they just need to find a way to get more people in the door.  I will definitely return."
1,"If you are trying to decide which non-Market District GE to visit in the East End, at least this one has a nice parking lot. It's definitely a mini step up from the Shakespeare Street location, so if I am in Squirrel Hill and need to grab something, I will run in here."
1,"Been there 3 times. Good food, but service could definitely be quicker. Also I have had multiple problems when it comes to credit card charges. They overcharged me last night and a few weeks ago gave the wrong card back to my girlfriend."
1,"Meager at best. Will never eat here again. First of all they tell you beer and wine is included with your meal (with a nice selection of imports in the trophy case behind the register). Only to find out all they serve is bud light from a keg and a white and red wine from (presumably) a box. THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF - if I Hadn't paid first I would have left.\n\nNext, the food was not particularly good. the carving station had some decent meats, but much was over-cooked and dry. There was a fishy funk by the seafood that make me leery of even trying the cooked shrimp. - much less the sushi and raw oysters.\n\nThat's my two cents - getting mad all over again thinking of what to write, so I'll stop now."
2,"I had high hopes for this place when the boss suggested it for lunch.  I had the lunch special: soup and half a sandwich.  I have to say that both were excellent in quality.  French onion soup-yum.  Chicken salad wrap-double yum.  Since there was a guy camped out at a table for four with his laptop and other people at the real tables, we were forced to sit in the back, which was very dark.  My boss enjoyed her egg salad sandwich on a savoy croissant, but liquid ran out of it.  (?)  My coworker thought the gazpacho was not to her liking, but she liked her sandwich.  The sodas were bottles in a fridge and my boss didn't like her iced coffee.  I think perhaps this is a good dessert place, but not really a ideal lunch place."
0,"Seriously? If you cuss the bartender will correct your word choice and possibly kick you out? Don't get me wrong, there's no need for gratuitous cursing, but it's called \""colorful language\"" for a reason -- it adds affect. Besides, this is an adult establishment, right? Where are the impressionable children and easily offended nuns? P*ss off.\n\nAs my accomplice said, \""This place is a f*cking time warp.\"" (Luckily out of ear-shot of the bartender.) That wasn't meant as a compliment. Rather, an observation of the tacky lounge-jazz on the juke box and inordinate amount of gaudy tiger decor filling up every square inch of wall space. Gag me.\n\nIf I'm brought back here, I'll be the one kicking and screaming in defiance.\n\n*For the record, I did not get kicked out. I just didn't like the feeling of having to watch my language so closely when I'm, go figure, AT A BAR!"
1,"Just writing a quick review to remind myself to never come in here again. Service is always gruff,  drinks and food waaaay over priced. .. And now I can add poor food quality to my list of issues. I should know better.  My salad (see pic) was missing three of the 5-6 listed ingredients,  came with maybe an ounce of dressing... And if those are mixed baby greens,  I was born on Mars! Just one of those leftover dinosaurs from the days when airports could get away with everything... it needs a gut job!  Oh, did I mention the obviously backed up grease trap coating my food,  my clothes,  etc with a stench that's beyond nauseating?"
3,"I've stayed at so many places in Las Vegas, since I have a relative that lives out there (and I like to play blackjack). I never stayed at The Quad when it was Imperial Palace, but once saw their car collection, and the Legends show there.\n\nWell, my parents went to the Quad, and were really happy with how inexpensive it was. Since I was attending the CinemaCon movie convention out there, which was at Caesar's Palace (directly across the street from The Quad), I booked a room for a few nights. I think I paid about $30 a night (week days), and I was THRILLED with the experience.\n\nAt so many hotels, I can hear doors slamming from other rooms. Never heard that once.\n\nThe room was a decent size, it was super clean, and I love that the maid didn't wake me up in the morning to clean the room. I'm so tired of hotels doing that.\n\nI did leave my car at Caeser's...as I wasn't sure where or how to get into the parking structure with all the construction going on. But even with the construction, I didn't hear any excess noise bleeding into my room.\n\nI enjoy that they have the rock stars come out and lip synch or sing. That's always fun while you're playing cards. I caught a Stevie Wonder one time, and Britney Spears another time.\n\nI liked the staff that was checking me in. Had a great conversation about the young man's love of hockey.\n\nIt was a great experience, and I'm glad I stayed there."
2,Decent Chain food... nuf said.
2,"Been to this location and the one in Phoenix. I'll break this down into two parts.\n\n1. Non-food\nWoah, $8 for two wings and a waffle. That's expensive! Family of 4 for lunch, $50. Really?\n\nService was good, but not stellar. Our waitress had a bit of an attitude, but I expected that. My wife wanted greens, but... absolutely, positively, no substitutions! Cm'on guys, would it really kill you to just let us have what ever side we want if they cost the same?\n\nBoth my kids enjoyed their drumsticks, mac-n-cheese, and red beans. But, both wanted more and left hungry.\n\n2. Food\nPretty good, but not great. The chicken is crispy and well seasoned. Maybe a hint of buttermilk in there, not sure. The waffles are just average.\n\nMac-n-cheese is very good. Fried okra is excellent too. Green beans, meh.\n\nI like sweet tea, but I was not prepared for the sugar saturated version they serve. Even 1/2 sweet - 1/2 unsweet was too much for me. Kids loved the kool-aid.\n\nConclusion\nI would love to go here more often, but they need to lower the prices and allow you to pick your side if the meal comes with one. I think LoLo's is mostly a fad, \""oh, look, Scottsdale has soul food, we are so cosmo!\"" I'm from Chicago and have eaten enough soul food to know good when I have it. LoLo's is just a tad above OK."
3,"I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and was surprised to see so many people here. There was a short wait for a table, so I ended up ordering a beer. I think it was called \""exposed\""...I do remember that it's brewed by the Horny Goat Brewing Co.\nAfter being seated, I had a tough time deciding what to order. The menu was rather big. In the end, it came down to the fish (tilapia) tacos, or the bratwurst sandwich. I couldn't make up my mind so I ordered both the bratwurst sandwich and a fish taco, for good measure.\nOverall, I was satisfied with the food, beer, and service. The food wasn't spectacular by any means, but seems like a cool place to hang out and have a few brews with good food. Also, the food seemed reasonably priced, but then again, I'm a Californian."
2,"I went to OHSO with a large group of friends and we were seated really quickly even though the place was packed.  The ambiance is great.  The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because I've been twice and wasn't extremely impressed with the food.  I'm a vegetarian and loved the fact that they have a veggie burger.  The burger was good, not amazing.  Another time I ordered some type of flat bread pizza which wasn't great.  One of my friends had the pulled pork and he LOVED it."
1,"we are here from California, visiting family, and they were excited to take us to Nielsons for frozen custard so we decided to eat dinner as well. They younger staff were very nice and helpful but the older woman manager was rushing us as we ordered and became agitated when one of us brought it to her attention that the bacon that she paid 1.50 extra for her burger was basically less than paper thin and full of holes. This woman manager was very rude about our request her 1.50 comped on our custard order, like it was an unreasonable request. Maybe the manager could be more willing to accomodate and have a better attitude towards customers. My 1 1/2 yr old niece dropped her frozen custard from kids plate and they didnt offer to replace it, or to even sell us another one. We had to buy a full size adult frozen custard. This manager is pretty stingy! WE loved the food, and the custard was very good, it would help business for this manager to be more people friendly."
0,Worst service ever!!! The manager David is not only useless and annoying but treats his employees like worthless dirt in front of customers. Will never eat at this location again if he is working!
2,This review is strictly for the 24 hour cafe.  After a night dancing away at Tao....us girls needed some grub.  And I wanted my cheap steak and eggs...it wasn't the $4.99 steak and eggs that I was promised but it was still cheap.  Not bad for the price.  $40 for 5 girls and they forgot to charge us some items and drinks...SCORE!  Also very close to the Rio where I was staying at.  The boys with us literally walked back to the hotel since they didn't want to join for our mid-night snack.
3,"The food & wine are good & happy hour is great, but, as nice as our waitress was, she brought our wine & appetizer, but our pizza never materialized."
0,This is my 4th stay here in the past 2 years. Now that it is no longer a Hilton it is a disaster. I will never stay here again. Smoke filled and dirty.
2,"My wife and I enjoy Aria and one of our favorite places to hang out is Bar Moderno.  This bar is adjacent to the casino and features a piano player in the evenings.  We enjoy it because you can hang out and have a conversation while people watching, which is one of our favorite things to do.\n\nWe planned to have a few drinks here then head over to Mandarin Oriental to hang out in their sky lounge.  The drinks here are about average for Vegas high end properties.  This particular evening we enjoyed a glass of Malbec.  We enjoy red wine and their Malbec is reasonable priced at $13 per glass.\n\nThe service was ok.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs, but once we closed the check, she ignored us.  That was too bad because we changed our mind and were going to order another round, but since she never came back we left and went to Mandarin Oriental.  I don't understand people sometimes.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, because we like Aria and it's one of the few lounges in town we really enjoy."
3,"OK, out of all the places I've been too, this is the most fun. So many fun and unruly nights here. And yes, afterwards was a buffets somewhere. So bad, yet so good."
4,"Come on people... I just finished reading all of your reviews. You are at a mid-range hotel, so set your expectations accordingly.\nAdmittedly I came on a slow night, but the food and service were absolutely terrific. Very fresh Ingredients and everything came out perfectly. The chicken sandwich was tasty (Excellent focaccia) and the french fries had a McDonald'sesque level of perfection.\nCome here with low expectations and enjoy the ride."
2,I attended a UYE here.  With about 20 people we overwhelmed the restaurant.  The company was great as was the food.  As a group we shared several appetizers and entrees and only the papaya salad was too hot for me.  The bulk of the dishes were ordered medium heat as that was what the majority felt we could handle and I did not taste a single dish I really did not like although I came out of there with some favorites I would order on my own.  I myself ordered Chicken Satay for an appetizer and duck in a red curry for my entree.  It is just the two women running the whole place.  I hope to get back again some time.
3,"I was very impressed with this location for my needs. I needed good access to my client in Tempe, but close enough to good restaurants or entertainment (downtown/ASU area).  Overall it's a great location.\n\nThe hotel reminds me of a suped-up hampton inn - add a bit more modern flair. The rooms are nice - very spacious, modern-like and clean.  Its great to have a refrigerator and sink area, a separate living area with an L sofa, a huge plasma TV, and good size desk area.  The bathroom sink is like part of the room, but it was great to see extra counterspace for all of my toiletries and makeup stuff.    I really enjoy the free breakfast (nothing fancy, but it's a nice to have for sure), and the small lobby area bar is great - beer, wine and a great tasting selection of bar type food.  The hotel attendants/staff are very friendly and helpful.  I didn't use the shuttle but I hear it takes you out and about (not just to the airport).  Free wi-fi throughout!\n\nI'm a fan of the nicer larger style hotels (Westin's/starwood are my fav), but you are limited when your job limits you to a certain budget.  So I seeked a Hampton Inn for my first trip to Tempe, and it was the Hampton Inn South Phoenix.  The hotel was great, but the surrounding immediate area(s) were not.  I would have felt very uncomfortable strolling to the mini mart next door or even walking to my car to go somewhere else.  So, I looked for a comparable price, similar benefits/accomodations, and I found this Hyatt place...which overall was better (not just b/c of location).  I have booked my next business trip at this hotel (3rd visit to Temple/Phoenix now)."
4,"Truly hidden, tucked away in the corner. But man, this place was great! Their lunch specials can't be beat. It took me a while to choose from the menu because all of it sounded so good! I decided to get the box because it has three different meats and rice. Their side dishes are served in a really cute way, and they really care about presentation. For an appetizer treat, they give you fried wonton strips that are sprinkled with sugar which are suuuper tasty. I even saved some for the end to dip in our vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and that was such a treat! \n\nThey place k-pop music videos and it's definitely a fun atmosphere. The inside decor is beautiful as well as the painting job on the way to the really clean bathrooms. That was a plus. My experience was here was very enjoyable. We came on a rainy day because I was getting my car done near by. And I'm glad we did! The lady was super nice and always helped with a smile. If you're ever in the area, you should try it!\n\nCheck in and get a free half order of yummy pot stickers! Worth it!"
1,"Terrible experience. First-it took over an hour to check in-so I didn't get in to my room until after 9pm. Then, once finally in my room, I tried to call down for a late check out, and they said they won't confirm or consider the request until 8am on the day of. What's the point at that point?! Then I noticed food crumbs on the alarm clock and a dried up wad of gum on the edge of the nightstand. Then I realized I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste just as I was ready to go to bed, and they don't offer those-you have to go to the gift shop to buy them. They won't let you even pay for it on the room tab and deliver-it has to be in person! So I had to either change clothes and go down then come back up and put my pj's back on or walk through the smokey and bumpin' casino (which doesn't seem so bad till you're over it and ready for bed) in my pj's just to smell of smoke even more as I'm going to bed. Super irritating! With all this talk about ultimate luxury on their 'hold' music when I called down there, this seems pretty low class to me. Not happy. Disgusting. Finally, the next morning, I needed to grab something quick to eat, and the front desk person recommended the cafe. The food came out somewhat quickly but was way more than I ordered (I wanted one english muffin with some eggs and cheese on it, and they brought out a styrofoam container FULL of eggs-it must have been an entire dozen of eggs, and they charged me accordingly). When I went to pay, it took about 10 minutes just to do that because the computer system was glitching, and even the manager when called over couldn't fix it in a reasonable amount of time.  The only reason I gave it a 2 star instead of 1 is that the man at the check-in counter and the girl that was trying to take my money at the cafe were very nice, even with being in an understaffed (check-in guy) and nonworking (cafe girl) department/hotel. They must pick and train their employees very well."
1,"Walked in on a Saturday evening and the place is empty. Totally empty, save for the guys working. Not a good sign. Perhaps it was that the fact that their sign wasn't working. But perhaps that assumption is too kind.\n   You order at a cash register after looking at the menu and pictures of the rolls taped to the glass of the sushi bar. Kind of makes ordering difficult if you want to take your time perusing the menu. At least the place was empty and we didn't feel rushed.\n   We ordered edamane, dumplings, and miso to start. The edamane was a bit too salty. The dumplings were fried, crispy, and fairly tasty. I didn't have the miso, but my sister-in-law and daughter were not impressed. They said it tasted like the instant kind you can buy at a grocery store. \n   We tried a few rolls next. The vegan friendly caterpillar roll was ok. It was too saturated in the sauce though, which made it fall apart the instant you tried to pick it up. The Hawaiian roll was totally bland. I couldn't even tell you what was in it. The spicy California roll was indeed spicy. That's about all I can say. The spider roll was pretty good. \n   This is the deal. You pay more than you should for small, subpar portions of bland food. The restaurant tries to be trendy and sleek with its decor, but when the ordering is set up like a fast food place... well yeah. It kind of kills whatever ambiance the place could have.\n   2 stars because I didn't get food poisoning. But that certainly isn't enough to make me want to go back."
4,"What a great find!! I'm not from the area but I've been looking for a place like this for a while. I think there should be a Zzeeks on every corner.\n\nSuper friendly, cheap, and GOOD! Awesome atmosphere fully loaded with 5 big screens for the games! Perfect size establishment and an experience you don't want to leave. Got the $5 lunch special complete with a large slice (1/4 of a 17\"" pizza) and a fountain drink. Ate there but was given a Togo cup when I was ready to leave. Make sure to ask for a side of ranch to dip, it's on the house! Will come back, even if I have to drive from Mesa to do so.\nThanks for an awesome Sunday lunch Zzeeks!!"
1,"First off, I wish I could have given five stars but like life, it only takes ONE person to ruin what good that could have came to others. \n\nMy GF and I were having issues with our phones so we decided to come into this store. Ryan, who is apparently a poor excuse for a manager, greeted us and I explained the issue I was having with my phone. Basically, the headset jack on the phone was faulty and simultaneously would give me alerts saying I'm plugging and unplugging my headset. Ryan was SO persistent that there was a software issue and asked if I had updated the software. It was already up to date and again he persisted that maybe something was in the hole of the jack. Believe me, before wasting time on my Vegas trip, I tried everything.. resetting, blowing air into the port, etc, to insure that there's no debris . Seems like he's more concerned about store profit than helping customers, who in fact, are in need of help. With that being said, I feel he needs customer service classes that he needs to enroll in. \n\nVerizon sales associate, Sarai, was more than helpful. She is the reason why I want to give FIVE stars for excellent customer service!\n\nExtremely friendly and patient with our needs. She took her time to help us out with both our phones when we were having some issues. She also explained some of the offers that would benefit us without having that \""salesman\"" attitude. With that being said, if everyone had Sarai's attitude and personality, many more people would probably feel more at ease browsing around the store without feeling the pressure. She definitely made our Verizon experience pleasant. \n\nI also believe that Alexis, who may be the other sales manager, was polite and helpful as well. When Verizon calls me for their survey, I'll be more than sure to let them know."
4,"I love the Phoenician. The grounds are wonderfully maintained and beautiful, the staff is impeccable and the amenities are great. This review is for high tea, though, specifically. I enjoyed high tea yesterday with a girlfriend and it was wonderful. It's so fun to put on your sun hat, your tea gloves and enjoy feeling pampered and posh. They do a great job and their tea menu is very good with many different offerings, the settings are lovely and the food is very good. We both had the Grand Royale Tea which included unlimited sparkling wine and tea plus the three course tea menu.\n\nTheir finger sandwiches are very good, though, I wanted a little more salmon on my smoked salmon offering. I enjoyed the ham and asparagus one and the chicken salad was lovely. The scones were amazing and their homemade lemon curd went wonderfully on the cranberry one. For the pastry course, the paris brest was alright, I've had better, but the creme puffs were excellent. I could have had one of each of the amazing selection but I tried very hard not to give in to too much temptation.\n\nIt is pricey and gratuity, at 22%, is added in, but what a lovely way to splurge! Dress your best, bring your girlfriends and enjoy afternoon tea."
4,"If you're in Vegas you owe it to yourself to book a lil pink party bus.\n\nIf you're not in Vegas, you should go, and when you do, you should book a lil pink party bus.\n\nOwner (Mike) is the most stand-up guy you'll ever meet, music on the bus is on-point, and you're guaranteed to make an entrance."
4,"canneloni! fresh spinach raviolis! Italian sausage, their recipe!\nNot so sure any fancy Italian restaurant can top their deli food."
4,Delicious and everyone there is so friendly!
4,"CHICK-FIL-A IS AWESOME.  I absolutely love this place. The food is awesome and my quote for you is \""eat mor chicken\"""
3,The service was amazing and food delicious
3,"So Jason wouldn't shut up about the Bang Bang shrimp since he'd had it while on TDY in Florida, so naturally after we rolled by Bonefish Grill after a day shopping at Town Square, we had to make plans to visit. We did so a couple weeks later after the Wine Walk in Town Square.\n\nWe started with the Bang Bang. Jason noted that the portion was much larger than he had received in Fl and it tasted exactly like he remembered. Maybe it was the wine talking, but I wasn't that big of a fan- I'll probably have to try it again sober.\n\nJason had the trout in the lemon sauce, and opted for the potatoes au gratin. His fish was delicious! The au gratin gave him a little trouble though, he noted that it was delicious, but when he took a deep breath over his food, the breadcrumbs of the au gratin had gotten lodged up into his trachea. DON'T BREATHE HEAVILY OVER THE AU GRATIN!\n\nI ordered the fish n chips.. but with quinoa instead of fries. The quinoa was AMAZING! Very fresh, and crisp. The fish was also much better than I had expected following finding out it was tilapia. I was very happy with it, but even better was the tarter sauce. The best I think I had ever had.\n\nService was also on point. Was a good meal, and we will definitely be back, but won't be making any special trips down here for it. If you're in the area, definitely stop by."
4,"I was invited to @SalvadorenoAZ for a special preview tasting of their Fuego #pupusa, with jalepenos and queso.\n\nIt was AMAZING!!! Muy delicioso!!\n\nI decided I wanted more, so I ordered a fuego carne asada pupusa.\n\nIt is now the only thing I will be ordering!!!\n\nThank you, @Salvadore\u00f1oAZ!!!"
2,"Located in the Planet Hollywood miracle mile mall we checked and couldn't find many better options as far as sports bars to watch the ncaa final four games.  The place had all you can drink beer happy hour and with games on that basically everyone in the bar was interested in, it made for a festive atmosphere.\n\nIt seemed hard to flag down a waitress, when i finally did i ordered some nachos that were pretty good.\n\nWould probably go back here if i wanted to watch a sporting event that happened to fall in to their happy hour(s)."
1,"Overall the experience was a bust. When we first moved to AZ 30 years ago Garcia's was all the rage. Moving back here recently, I decided to take my family there. Starting off, service was slow, but hey it was 7pm on a Friday. \n\nThe staff was pleasant, the cheese crisp was excellent...it better be ;p. After that it went down hill. The food was unseasoned...just bland. The Grande Burro I had was half tortilla...just a mouthful of dough. Half way through I found a big, nasty strand of chicken skin and fat. \n\nI informed the waitress and she said she would inform the chef and left the check behind. No offer to send over the manager or deduct it from the bill. She ended up brining a new one to go. The new burro came so quickly it's completely obvious it was pre-made and chucked in the microwave. I brought it home but I'm scared to touch it. \n\nI won't be bringing anyone back. Sorry Garcia's.....adios amigo."
3,"This place was wicked wild. The best part, is when I showed up a Miamian (who I knew) was currently running the gig. So it made it even more awesome! Definitely check it out if you in Vegas. Get there early to snag a green pool chair!"
3,"If you want a sports bar and Chicken Wings, this is your place  Service is terrific.  One can get Chicken Wings prepared any way and whatever size they want.  Not healthy, but yummy."
0,4 flights delayed today at the airport and this place is running out of chicken and turkey which is mostly all of there sandwiches    Unreal   This has happened numerous times ! Don't bother!
1,"Pros: nicely appointed room, standard four star stuff.\n\nCons: The walls are paper thin. I could literally hear word for word a conversation from the room next-door and there was not even a connecting door between the rooms.\n\nThe casino/hotels just seem to be built better as far as noise cancellation properties (i.e., insulation ) than your typical business class hotel.\n\nOtherwise a nice hotel."
0,Really odd store. I went in to ship stuff for work with a pre-paid shipping label but no envelope. Guy at counter said to grab an envelope from the side- not a ups envelope but a tan blank one like you'd get at Office Depot. Weird but okay. Then when I checked out they tried to charge me for the envelope. Very odd UPS store experience.  Do not recommend.
4,"Just as I was beginning to doubt the existence of amazing food in Las Vegas we stumbled upon this place.\n\nWe sat outside on the patio, with a view of the pirate ships.  The waiter was great, he made recommendations and every one of them was dead on.  There were tons of wait staff around, and whoever was close would take care of you with out being intrusive.  John was our waiter and he was awesome (and not hard on the eyes either).\n\nWe were encouraged to order one dish at a time and take our time.  We did and we left comfortably full and satisfied.  We had at least three courses (I was exhausted so I'm a little fuzzy on it).  \n\nThe whole experience was heaven.  And if you time it right, you can see the Sirens of TI show with an unobstructed view."
0,"Went into Petsmart this last weekend with my daughter who was interested in getting two frogs. We didn't know much about what was needed and how to care for them. I asked a gentleman to get the frog aquarium down from up top, he did, and I explained we were going to be getting two frogs. He left...didn't come back. Everything down-spiraled from there. People who didn't know anything and were generally rude. If it wasn't for it being her birthday and her excitment I would have never spent $200 here. At least I know better now."
2,"The only reason this place is just A-OK to me is because they never have what I'm looking for. Went looking for Archer DVD's and they didn't have the particular season in stock, then went looking for accessories for my Macbook Air, and they only have cases for the Pro. Ended up making my purchases online. :(\n\nThe service is always friendly, and there are always a ton of people to help you."
3,awesome as always
3,Have been here twice.  Food was good and prices were acceptable.  Waitress was so far off her game...slow slow slow. Once food order got turned in food was served by kitchen staff immediately.  So first visit good second was ok.  I guess I need another visit to see my final opinion.
0,"Nicht besonders zu empfehlen, die Mega burger sind war nett und ein Highlight zum anschauen aber leider nur fettig und knorpelig.... Das Ambiente ist nett mit den Krankenschwestern aber das war es leider auch schon...."
0,"Empire taught me that I'm the biggest sucker in the world...and it's a costly lesson. \n\nWe originally called them because our septic backed up and it was 11pm on a Sunday night. I thought I did my due diligence researching and finding a company that handles emergency repairs in the middle of the night. \n\nThe guy came out and fixed the problem and quoted me one price that was like without the service agreement and another price about $200 lower with a $16.50 service agreement for one year. I opted for the service agreement and paid about $375 for the plumbing (they snaked the line to unplug it). They also came out and checked my AC later in the week and said it was fine.\n\nThe next time they came out to check the AC they replaced the outside blower and added a kickstarter to the unit and charged me about $700. I just found out from my new AC guy that the blower would have been under warranty so they really took me on that job. \n\nNext my plumbing backed up again but this time snaking it didn't work. They had to open up my back patio to replace a pipe and also had to have the septic pumped. Two guys did the job in about 6 hours, a subcontractor pumped the septic and the only part was a wide PVC like pipe. The final bill was just under $4000 and this didn't include patching the patio cement so now there's a giant 3'x1' hole with an exposed pipe in my patio. $1100 of this amount was for the septic to get pumped, about triple what I would have paid had I picked up the phone and called someone myself. \n\nMy advice to you, don't buy the service agreement and avoid Empire. And anyone that is saying that they saved a ton with all this preventative maintenance is just a big sucker like me. They come out twice a year to figure out what they need to sell you and replace things even if they're under warranty."
2,"After a gluttonous weekend, we decided to walk to Boudreaux's for our Sunday morning recovery food.  Well, most of us did, but we split up so that some of us took a car and put our name in.  When we asked for 10, the hostess looked quite worried, even when we said we'd sit separately, and advised us to call ahead next time.  Is this really a problem, when only three tables in the place have customers?  But by the time we were seated and everyone got there, the restaurant was packed, and there was a line out the door!  So take her advice: for large parties, call ahead.\n\nI could really get to like this place, at least the bar.  $2.50 Mimosas on Sundays!  Woohoo!  The server was very friendly, and took our orders for beverages, even though she couldn't legally serve us for 20 minutes.  Sure enough, as soon as noon rolled around, we saw the bartender making our order.  They were pretty good mimosas, especially for $2.50.\n\nI was going to go with the Croissant Florentine (eggs Florentine on a croissant), but opted instead for the special omelet (shrimp, chevre, asparagus, spinach, tomatoes).  I was glad that I'd avoided the Croissant Florentine because they'd used frozen spinach, but I wasn't thrilled with the omelet, since the eggs were overcooked, making the whole thing chewy.  I wish I could have just gotten those toppings on scrambled eggs.  The portions were HUGE, particularly for the biscuits and gravy.  \n\nWhile the food wasn't great, I think that had more to do with my tastes and poor ordering on my part.  The staff was wonderful with that relaxed Cajun vibe permeating the air.  I will definitely go back, but I'll be trying some of the Cajun classics instead of the omelets."
2,"For some reason we received an offer for a free weekend here so we figured why not? We weren't sure what to expect. What we found was a lovely hotel, recently renovated, with comfortable rooms/beds and a very good location. The hotel really needs to put coffee makers in the rooms - going down to the lobby for free coffee is fine, but not desirable when you aren't quite ready to get dressed. The restaurants all looked like they were squeezed in as an afterthought with banquet room chairs and strange ambience. I didn't mind the weird shower door too much since the water pressure wasn't strong enough to hit the back of the shower. There was a Zumba convention in the area and on Saturday they closed the street outside and Zumba-ed. We're odd in that we like to go back to the hotel for an afternoon nap so the racket from Zumba made it difficult to enjoy the room thoroughly. I'd consider a return stay but there are so many other options downtown that it would be a while before I'd go back. \n\nBy the way, it was nice to be away from the strip, and $30 cab rides there made it even more desirable not to go there."
3,good Italian place... the menu has some unique things and they do a good job... it is pretty expensive but for specials occasions it is good.  Zac is right about the accents... but it adds to the flavor and the pesto butter is pretty good as well...
0,"Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....\n\nI go in what is your best chicken Idem....\n\num Burrito or taco? he asks\n\nHave you had the Burrito?\n\nno....I haven't had ethier...\n\nHave any one eaten anything here?

4,"This place is probably my favorite coffee in AZ. The people working are very friendly and helpful. They have a nice food selection, not the best but nothing more than I expect. I would probably come more if they had breakfast sandwiches. Anyway, the place is great, the coffee fires you up as good coffee should and the people watching us above average being situated at the corner of Thomas and 68th. Enjoy!"
0,Worst business ever award. They never answer the phone. Their.customer service is terrible. The store is disorganized and looks like black Friday is everyday. Go somewhere else if you can.
3,"This place was a true gem that I found on my brief stint in Pittsburgh.  A bunch of friends and I were sitting at the double tree bar with it closing down and asking ourselves, where can we go now?  I friend picks up a piece of paper with local bars in the area and he says \""The Hop House, that sounds fun\""...I respond \""I'M DOWN!\""\n\nIt's hard to find bars that carry a good selection of microbrews and I'm glad the Hop House did. Delirium Tremons and Delirium Noctorum are great beers, but be careful these 10% ABV beers will get to you.  Compare to bars in SF and LA, the prices at this bar are dirt cheap.  I got smashed at the Hop House...the bartender could use a little pick me up in terms of attitude but at least she didn't kill my buzz."
4,"Love it, love it, love it! I have always been a fan of eyebrow threading, but traveling all over the world it is hard to find a place that does a good job. I naturally have asymmetrical eyes and eyebrows, which isn't obvious in real life, but it shows up horridly in photographs (my license is gross). I'm a self-taught makeup artist and as much as I try, I could never get my eyebrows to even out because they were just THAT off, at least to me. I just went in today and told Shaila (sp?) how I felt about that, and she actually got it, she understood me. My eyebrows look even now, and the price was great."
4,"The first thing you notice when you visit this no-kill sanctuary is how clean, peaceful and well organized it is. Every bunny is well cared-for and has a goodly amount of space for their pen thanks to efficient placement and organization. The staff and volunteers make it a point to know each bunny e.g. personalities, likes/dislikes, etc. to the point where they attach a diagram of bunny's pen layout (they like their dish over here, their hiding place over there, etc.) to the front of their pen so that volunteers know where everything goes when they clean the bunny's space. And every bunny gets groomed, petted, fed, watered, loved and properly tended. The staff and volunteers are dedicated to finding each bunny a happy and safe \""forever home\"", and don't just give bunnies to anyone who asks. They make sure that you really want the bunny and will be able to take care of it as it deserves. Tranquility Trail Animal Sanctuary can and should serve as a model for all other animal rescues, as they truly love these creatures and are well-schooled in how to care for them and take time to answer any questions new bunny owners have. These bunnies are not just a bunch of homeless critters - They are all members of their bunny family. If you are looking for a bunny, please adopt one instead of buying one, and please give one of the many adorable bunnies from this sanctuary a chance to be a part of your family. Tranquility Trail also has a handy store on the premises that is well stocked with quality items you need for your bunny at prices significantly less than pet stores. And every penny goes directly back to the sanctuary bunnies I aopted my bunny from them and will do so again in the future. In Yelp-ese, 5 stars means \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"", and it really, truly is."
1,"This place gets two stars not because it sucks, but just because it's very \""meh\"". I heard alot of hype about this place from friends and my Hispanic friends as well that kept calling this place the \""Mexicans' Mexican restaurant\"". Well, if that's the case, then clearly Mexican cuisine leaves much to be desired.\n\nI ordered a flauta dish that was large in portion size and skim on flavor. Like most Mexican food however, I felt like I was busting at the seams after I was walking out of the restaurant. One good thing I will say about this place though is that their chips and salsa are pretty good. In the end, I really don't know what was worse: my deflated expectations or my burning intestines the next morning."
0,"Don't get me wrong, the ride was fine, if a bit short.  My complaint is that I paid for the downloadable pictures and I have no pictures, almost two weeks later.  Three emails to customer service has yielded nothing, and my next stop is going to be disputing the charge with my bank.  Seriously, $40 is a ripoff as is, for pictures that cost them practically nothing, but to not receive them, and to have my emails ignored, is an insult, not to mention horrible business."
4,"Such a great experience!  Decy was wonderful, and patient while I searched for THE dress.  The selection was awesome, and the prices were affordable.  I highly recommend!"
3,How many stars I'd give this place depends on a lot on what you order.  The service is great and the bread rolls they give you are out of this world.  \n\nBut the dishes can be hit or miss.  Haven't really enjoyed some of their pork dishes even though I love pork.  If you go there for lunch you can get a really good burger.  Anything with couscous has been really tasty.\n\nMight be a little pricey for what you get.  But it's in a convenient location at Palazzo and you'll rarely have a problem getting a table.
2,"Good theater with on par service.  Friendly smiles all around, and young people who actually do their jobs!  They work hard to keep the theater's clean, and patrons actually help out (most take their trash otu with them -- who'da thunk that one?)  Overall, a family friendly movie theater with easy access for disabled patrons.  Pricey, but heck -- isn't that the case with all theaters these day (Anyone remember when you could get into the movies for under a buck?  Agh!  I am dating myself...I digress.)  Tip - save some $$ and buy your tickets through AAA.  Discount tickets are good for most shows, except for special engagement viewings."
3,"Carne Asada Tacos (no gristle) for $1.25. They even throw some chips and beans on your plate for free.\n\nThe BEST, FREE Salsa bar in this neighborhood (check Sonny's pic if you don't trust me).\n\n Jump my gringo ass into this gang, esse. This place is da bomb!!!"
2,"It's a New York style deli, long on huge portions, not so much on flavor.  We only ate there for breakfast this time, the first day I ordered cheese blintzes.  Now my Jewish grandmother made those for years and I never had one that looked or tasted like these did.  These were deep fried and so crunchy that they begged for some sort of fruit sauce.  Alas, only choice was either sour cream or apple sauce.  Next day I had an omelet which was huge.  Supposed to be a cheese omelet but the only cheese was on top not in the middle.  Every thing is huge as mentioned before, costs $3.00 to share which might be a better option, no one can eat this much."
4,"a coworker recommended this place, thank you. What a fantastic place. I probably spent this much easy at the sushi places in Ohio and had much less. I will be back and bring any friends that visit who enjoy sushi."
3,Last night was my first time in The Little Theater which is part of Phoenix Theater.  I didn't see it on the list so I'm reviewing it here. \n\nWe saw Reefer Madness the musical!  It was awesome!  I couldn't stop laughing.  The sound of the theater was excellent! \n\nIt was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable.\n\nThey had snacks out during intermission.  We bought two water bottles and I was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans.  They also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished. \n\nI will definitely see another play here!
3,"This is actually one of my favorite pool parties mainly because they have pretty sick dj's and the stage is great also the line moves extremely fast for a pool party. Of course every place has something wrong with it, it could use some color and a little more shade and trees , but if your looking to have a good time and hear some great dj's then this is def a good spot to check out. Tables are typical for a pool party and i would say pricing for GA is a lot less then places like wet or encore beach. Overall fun venue day or night."
4,Worth taking a trip off the strip!!! The sushi is very fresh and absolutely delicious! The all you can eat is a great deal since it even includes sashimi! Get the sy special and Super white tuna! The chefs and the waiters are awesome! Great service and great food! Will be coming back!
4,"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!  I LOVE CHEESE!  More importantly, I love Beecher's cheese from Seattle, and guess which place carries this lovely cheese...  This place is totally awesome.  They have a lovely selection of cheeses and everything looks and tastes fresh.  The staff is more than happy to get you samples or to give you some recommendations.  I will definitely be back many many times after I finish nibbling on my tiny blocks of Manchego and Beecher's Flagship cheeses.  YAY!"
2,"Came here for lunch last Sunday with a reservation just because it is a smaller location. It was alright but for the pricing, it wasn't anything crazy good. Unless you're coming here for pizza, I'd rather go to Mesa Grill or Cheesecake Factory. Also one thing I really hated, was the fact that it wasn't too busy but everything took FOREVER! A quick lunch ended up being 2 1/2 hours! We would have ordered dessert but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for that.\nFor appetizer we had the Prime Beef Sliders. The flavor was really delicious and the beef was really tender but oh my goodness, these are the smallest sliders I've had in my life. Their height was the length of my thumb and was as big around as a silver dollar. Also, their baby portion of fries was good but again, the portion was hilarious. I think these were about $16? Not worth it.\nMy boyfriend had the chicken sausage pizza and sure the portion was great but that's because it's a pizza. The flavor was good, but you could get the same at Settebello or CPK. They also served it with Pasilla peppers on top.\nI had the Atlantic Salmon. Salmon was cooked perfectly but their pairing with the curried califlower didn't match in my opinion. Nothing memorable for this dish either and I believe the pricing was about $28.\nHonestly, if everything had been about $5 cheaper, they would maybe get 4 stars because nothing was really wrong with anything we ate but everything we tried, we could get somewhere else with better flavor, more reasonable pricing, and it wouldn't have taken 2 1/2 hours. Sorry Spago, this one was a miss for me. I would defintiely recommend Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for a lunch option at Caesar's instead."
3,"Amber, you're the consummate server! Thank you!! We had a great time at YH. Merlot really packs a punch ! The steak salad was fantastic but pricey. They don' t offer a lunch size. Of course I had to order some of their delicious g fries. It' s dark inside and very cozy. The seating booths are comfortable and very ample. This was a special BY for 2 of us and Amber didn' let down us down with beautiful desserts that were complementary. Nice display of \""birthday\"" in brown sugar. Awesome! 1 star less because the manager came over and told us someone complained about  our loudness and language. Why were 2 small children and mom seated nearby? It was nearly empty with most people outside. We're an exuberant bunch of ladies not intintended for little ears.  It put the kibosh on festivities."
4,"Love this breakfast place, service is good, food is great, servers are really nice, have come to know some of them from my freqent visits.  Also been to the one on rainbow, same thing, very consistent."
3,"Went there for dinner. We had the egg rolls, Mongolian beef, and Generals chicken. Food was really good. The only negative thing I can say is that the egg rolls were a little on the greasy side and you don't get very many. Service was good. Decor is outdated but place was clean."
4,"We love this place and have been going for several years. Even with a newborn. My daughter who is now 3, loves it here too. Service is great and the staff is super friendly. The food is also really good. We love going for breakfast with the $10 off coupon they offer. The beer selection is great. Just love it. My husband likes going himself to sit in the bar area as well."
0,"overpriced garbage.  the 12 dollar toastada salad (with three tiny bites of steak) was nothing more than a side salad.  they are so cheap that they charge for chips.  they also do not take total rewards comps (there are no signs to tell anyone in the place or on the menu), and all they could say was sorry.  how about putting up a sign that states you do not take harrah's comps!!!\n\nmuch better places to eat than this garbage, overpriced place."
3,"As a vegetarian for almost 20 years, it was refreshing to find Green.   It's great to be able to enjoy a BBQ pulled pork sandwich or crab puffs... without having to sacrifice an animal.  More restaurants now are becoming vegetarian friendly, but there is something to be said about not having to choose between a salad and a Portobello burger, I can eat everything on the menu!   My absolute favorites are the thyme fries, Texas \""Moo-shroom\"" Po-boy , and the orccietta pasta.  The food is tasty, but the atmosphere reminds me of a local dive bar.  I have only eaten in the restaurant twice; it's kind of an \""artsy\"" place and not really my style.  I order takeout regularly though, the service is great and the cashier is always super friendly.  My boyfriend is a meat eater, and enjoys their food, he actually suggests it!   I recommend substituting Green for your next trip to Chili's and see what you think. I think you will be pleased, especially as a vegetarian or vegan."
4,"Co+Hoots is truly one of the gems of Phoenix. I've met some of my favorite people in the city while working at co+hoots. It's just not a place to co-work from, but also place to become a part of the city's pulse.\n\nHere you can collaborate with other creatives and like minded individuals. There are some wonderful companies and individuals working from Co+Hoots, some of which will make a lasting impact on the city. \n\nIt is one of my favorite places to be in Phoenix!!"
0,"This is another example of buying product hype and a service that is not ready for primetime. \n\nWhen it works, it's great, when it doesn't, which is often, customer service is clueless. They go by a manual but clearly don't know what the purpose is for certain procedures.\n\nThen, when nothing else works, you get transferred (maybe) to a \""Level 2 tech.\"" Oh boy! \n\nWhat they've usually said, after a lot of useless attempts from the livel 1 tech, is, \""Oh, they're down for maintenance.\"" This was said once in the middle of the day. I asked if they meant routine maintenance, she said she thought so. \n\nThere's a great time to do it. During business hours, if that was correct.\n\nWhen it wasn't working for the 3rd day in a row, I was told they would need 7-10 days to investigate. Then, this morning, it was working again. But, it wouldn't connect with Gmail. Everything else worked but that. The level 1 tech suggested I disconnect the modem and/or router, reboot, etc. Now nothing works. I called back and they said the system is out in this area. He said it would be back online within an hour. That was 3 hours ago!\n\nBeware, buy only when all the beta kinks are out."
4,"It's my favorite.  We get our BARF/Raw catfood from there.  \nIt can be expensive, but generally speaking they carry a better product.  \nThey have a wonderful cheese selection too.\n\nDon't let them use a 1000 bags at checkout.  They will put 2 items in one plastic bag.  I've been meaning to speak to the manager about this..."
4,Freakin Amazing!  The roasted Garlic is a meal on its own.  The Carne Adovada is top shelf...  will be trying to recreate that this weekend at home....
0,Wow...
2,"Ice cream is ice cream in my opinion no matter where you go, so when I want an ice cream break while at work I'll make a stop here. Only problem is the customer service is so-so and the employees definitely like to take their sweet time serving you (no pun intended)."
4,"They were at my hotel to pick me up in less than 5 minutes. Now that's amazing! The art work on the walls is super cheesy and with a little effort they could make it much nicer, but overall the experience was great! The massage was really nice too! If you need something quick and you don't want to pay high hotel prices check this place out!"
1,"One of the few US airports that I have encountered with toilet attendants.  This concept is ok, but the reality of it is that every time you go in one at Charlotte, you have the impression of being accosted by street vendors in a 3rd world country.   I'm not sure what their function is except to collect tips.  They don't put toilet paper in the stalls.  They don't clean urine off the toilet seats.  They only thing I saw them do was tear off a paper towel and hand it to me and then expect a tip.  If you don't leave a tip, then they are rude.  Get real Charlotte, pay your cleaning crew to clean the toilets and get rid of the bogus attendants.  I don't like to be accosted when I need to pee."
4,Amazing!\n \nThe #32 - Kelly D is amazing. Absolutely to die for. Also dont forget the #79 Monkey special with eel sauce and a deep fried banana!\n\nBest Sushi in Vegas
2,"I enjoy this place thoroughly. I usually get a chocolate and coconut smoothie with chopped bananas. It is addictive. My girlfriend typically gets the avocado smoothie or the jasmine milk tea. \n\nI haven't had the hot items. Unfortunately, once I've found something I enjoy it's hard to break a habit."
1,A meal that was bland.\nA waiter who loved himself.\nA Josh won't be back.
4,"I eat here all the time, food is really good. They serve a good portion for your money, I recommend the grilled mahi mahi very tasty!"
3,"Clean room, nice staff, comfy bed. Location is all right, but the hotel is huge, so walking can be a pain. And I dont know about other rooms, but I stayed in a room with a single king size, and the bathroom doors were made if tinted glass,.. Which looks goos, but you couldnt lock them and you werent  totally private when you were using the bathroom. I guess it doesnt matter if you are with a girl/boyfriend, but maybe with family.\n\nBut besides that, thumbs up!"
4,"Some of the fastest service considering it is in a very busy hotel, even when there is a long line the service is still pretty fast for the amount of people in line. If you don't like waiting there is 2 locations inside Mandalay bay so just head to the other one."
2,"Went shopping here today...not quite Costco or Sam's Club and neither are the prices but some of the items are worth while...my apartment is not big enough for me to buy large quantities of things in bulk so overall, when I can shop here and find something it is cool.\n\nThis is a good place I think for the small mom and pop places that have a higher markup than the corporate giants...overall 3 stars..maybe 3 and 1/2 on a good day."
4,"Had a baller ass suite! Gym , hot tub, living room and sauna.  When im picky I tell people to book me here!  Room service loves me as I love them. I ask for a robe they bring me plenty and nice ones at that! Room service will clean the room at the drop of a dime mid day or midnight!"
1,"This place has decent burgers, but it's definitely something you can skip. That being said, it reminds me of fancier Red Robin."
4,"Been dying to try Federal Pizza...since we love Postinos, Joyride Tacos and Windsor. We met some of our foodie friends there, which was great because we got 4 different pizzas and shared...we all eat vegetarian too and there were such great options!\n\nHere's what we had:\n-Gemini- excellent flavor - my husbands favorite...the Gorgonzola was the perfect cheese mixed with the other ingredients\n-Margherita- great and simplistic\n-At Last - super tastes with all the veggies...wish we would have not left off the goat cheese, but not everyone was a fan of goat cheese\n-Brussels Sprout - had to get it without pancetta...this one was my favorite! Super super flavorful...\n\nThe dough for the crust was delish! I would say this place ranked above Pizzeria Bianco for me...and I love Biancos.\n\nWe finished off the meal with dessert: Bombolini. Warm sugar donuts with chocolate dipping sauce...great end to the meal\n\nI would highly recommended FP to everyone!!"
1,"Not quite my cup of tea. It's a chill little lounge. We got in for free, so I can't complain. The crowd is pretty much older. There were also a few cougars, well independent cougars, if that makes it any better. I was quite bored just standing around. Just go to Club XS instead!! Right across the casino."
4,"Ok, truth be told, I've been to Vegas about 40 times, and many of those trips were / are with my best buddy, as we'd get away for a guys weekend or whatever.  Every single time we'd see a billboard, an ad or any literature with Carrot Top in it, we'd just chuckle, call him  the'Top' and blow it off like little school-boys.  Trust me, it was funny when we'd make the comments- we're hysterical.  Point being, we thought the guy was a joke (without knowing much about him)\n\nWell, I got an offer once for 2-1 tickets to 'the Top', so we bit the bullet and went.  Actually, we had a few more guys along for this trip, so 4 of us ended up going, all with VERY low expectations.  I mean...have you seen how this guy looks?  Surely he can't be that funny...\n\nWell, hell....was I ever wrong!  Yeah, he's still funny looking, but I LAUGHED the entire show, start to finish.  I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.  Tears rolling down my face laughing.  I laughed like a fat-baby laughs- that deep, funny laugh that you can't help but smile when you hear it laugh.  \n\nHe's quick.  Prop to prop, and honestly, I don't think it's scripted- whatever prop he sees, he comments on and quickly moves on to the next.  It's 90 minutes of rapid fire props and funnies.  Every one in my party was amazed and thought it was the funniest thing they had seen.\n\nFast forward a few years (to August of 2013) and I went back again with my girlfriend.  The show was fresh, even funnier...and we both laughed as much as I did the first time.  \n\nHe's not dirty, but he's not clean.  It's adult humor for sure- there are some dildo jokes and sex jokes, so if you're easily offended, stay away.  If you're a perv like me and don't mind stuff like that, get in line and be ready to laugh.\n\nThe bit about the Luxor light being as bright as that tiny crack in the curtains in any hotel room is spot on, and the next time you're in a room and light is shining through, you'll laugh every time thinking back to that bit.  Most of his humor is very observant, timely and related to current events.  He's a real talent.\n\nFYI- the theater is cold.  Dress appropriately."
2,"Well, there were some really great things about this place, and some really not so great things about this place. I think a lot of the things in the reviews I read seemed to be accurate about the restaurant, like about the food and service.\n\nOne good thing was the cashiers were nice. Did not have any problems with that. I ordered the Mediterranean Platter, which on the menu said it could be made vegan upon request. However, when I asked for it to be made vegan, they said they couldn't because the Greek salad is pre-made. Was not a big issue, as I am vegetarian and not vegan, but I can see how this would be annoying for a vegan coming here! The food took a long time to arrive, not like crazy long, but longer than what seemed normal. My platter had hummus, crusty bread, a little salad, and dolmas. The hummus was delicious, I have to confess, I ate some of it just straight up with a fork. The crusty bread was tasty too, just a bit too crunchy, but good. The salad was a bit watery, but the flavors were good. The dolmas were horrific. Ive only had dolmas a few times, but these were the absolute worst, had a very strange flavor. No one at my table enjoyed them.\n\nThe group I came with was mostly satisfied with their food. My boyfriend's grilled cheese was a little cold. Not like really cold, just cold in terms of what you'd expect in a grilled cheese. Also the water tasted weird, but its Arizona, so this is nothing new!\n\nThe desserts were pretty dang good. We shared a cranberry white chocolate cookie, a pumpkin spice macaron, and a caramel macaron. The caramel was the best! The other two were good as well. My boyfriend got a French chocolate macaron, and it tasted like a brownie. \n\nKinda sad I missed coming here for breakfast! I do not know if I'd come back for a meal, but I would come back for some macarons if I was in the area."
2,"While entertaining my family around the strip, we stopped here for dinner.\n\nI have always seen the ads and worked around this area.  Finally get to sit down and eat here.  Seated very quickly, very unique setting inside.  Bar area visible to dining patrons.  Place is a little difficult to get into.  \n\nWe all ordered different items: pan pizza, truffle burger, and the monster double patty burger.  Out of the three, the truffle burger was the special with the sweet bun.  Very tasteful, but everything else was okay.  Pizza didn't have anything special that stood out and the double patty was just another burger.  Looking around, this place is more for drinks since they offer many fish bowls.  I think next time, i will stop by for drinks.  \n\nService was how it should be, on top.  Refills and all."
2,"This is the first drive-only location i have ever seen. It is right across from the JC Penny at Paradise Valley Mall. It does have a couple of benches you can sit on outside to enjoy your doughnuts...and it is very quick and easy to drive thru and get your doughnuts. However with all that being said...a dozen doughnuts cost 9.18 yes...nine dollars and 18 cents...that is ridiculous. The doughnuts are good...but definitely now worth nine dollars and 18 cents (yes i am repeating it again...lol). If however your near PVM and need some good doughnuts this is your place if you willing to pay the price for them. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends!!!!"
4,"We walked into the M, and immediately, there was someone to greet us. Very friendly. No smoke smell (yet.. this is a new hotel, and maybe the smoke hasn't settled in yet, maybe they have a good ventilation system?).\n\nWe got to the buffet at around 11am and there were maybe 6 people ahead of us. As soon as we got our seats, there were 50 people in line - we got lucky. It was about $30 for lunch.\n\nThe food was REALLY good! They had an infinite amount of king crab legs! There was a lot of REALLY good food including: Adobo Chicken, Noodles, Oysters, Sushi, Chicken, Meat, etc - I didn't really spend too much time there because I was too busy filling up on the crab legs - cold and hot.\n\nThey would get 5 stars just because of two simple facts: 1. unlimited king crab legs. 2. all-you-can-drink wine and beer!!!!!!!!\n\nWORTH EVERY PENNY!\n\nWe even saw Chris Anderson from the Denver Nuggets there!\n\nAnd if you Tweet about the @MResort, they WILL respond back!"
3,"The Cafe Bellagio came in very handy for my friends and I at after a long night at the Palms. I know that food always tastes better when you have been drinking, but the food was still better than I thought it would be. I had a huge Southwest Omelette that came with hash browns. It had chicken, cheese and some jalapenos to add some spice. I am not usually a fan of hash browns, but these were good and my friend was even eating them off my plate. It appears a bit pricey as expected in the Bellagio, but the portions were big.  It is open 24 hours so it should be always an option any time of the day!"
4,"When this place was still pretty new, my friends and I slammed them with a few 15-20 person parties. They were happy to serve and even split up checks without groaning. So, they get five stars for that alone. Topping it off are their cheap sweet potato fries. It's a nice option for friends that can't afford to drop a lot, but you still want to include at a cool location."
1,The massage I received was good but that is the only positive thing I can say about my experience.  I had $200 in gift cards and learned that after 12 months a $10 per month fee is deducted so I had $70 on 1 card and no balance on 2nd card that also should of been $70.  I have called customer service 3 times and have not spoke to anyone that wants to help me and they don't return calls. The spa is high priced and the attendants were some friendly some not. There are better spas to go to in Las Vegas. Don't buy there gift cards!!
2,"Nice little plaza, easy parking - seems a bit expensive, but that's Vegas. Very nice inside with friendly staff."
4,"I've been a customer here for years. I have tried other places but always come back. They always fit me in, even when I come without an appointment. I have used most of the techs and the service is consistent. The owner will make it right if there is a problem. She has taken care of me on the spot when I have walked in without an appointment numerous times when I've broken a nail, or smeared my polish before my pedicure was dry .I have brought others here too, and we have always left happy!"
0,"Went in for a manicure, paid 14 dollars and left with nails not painted. Basically all he did was file and trim cuticles.  I think the polished I picked was old and when it bubbled some lady there said it was my nails that made to polish bubble up! He took color off, tried again...same thing. I asked for clear and he didnt even get all the color polish off....I will never go back...the lady was so rude to me."
0,"Been here about 2-3 times back in 2002. \n\nThe bartenders/servers all had breast implants and were fake as hell! And not very nice either. \n\nThe last time I went in, there was this bartender with short blondish-brownish hair named Mickey (or Nikki, I don't remember). She had fake boobs that look like she could be in the porn industry (they were like a H cup or something). She had the worst attitude I had ever seen in a bar. I was dating this guy and he kept his attention at her the entire time. I left the bar, after I stuck the finger at her, and walked home. He came and got me and said he was sorry. I stayed with him for another 3 months and left his butt after. \n\nThe atmosphere was very boring (all the men were breasts fanatics only). The drinks were too expensive for my taste. Just not a good place. I don't know about these days, but in 2002, it was horrible. And if you're a female patron, you find that the bartenders are going to want to compete against you on who is more gorgeous. That's what it felt like to me at the time."
4,"Great flavors (though a small selection at any one time), and friendly service.  Seating is out back on a patio with heaters."
3,"Pros- Most comfortable bed ever, 3 flatscreens in each suite, 1.5 bathrooms, awesome shower, big ass room!... Your friends will think you're hot shit. \n\nCons- BURNT pizza from room service (freakin' black!), and their mini shampoos and conditioners don't smell good. \n\nIt's a really nice place to stay when in Vegas- especially if you plan on spending more than 2 hours a night in the room! (Hey- it's Vegas, though... how much time do you really spend in the room with your eyes open, right?) I'd definitely stay here again."
3,"Nice little place that serves deliciously fresh Greek food at excellent prices.  The service is always very friendly and the restaurant is very clean.  We have never been disappointed here with we have eaten in or taken out.  Great place for that \""ooops...I forgot to take something out for dinner\"" night."
1,"I don't see the big deal with this place. The \""strips\"" are frickin chips with shredded cheese. The hot sauce was pretty good though. Carne asada burrito was okay, but nothing outstanding. I know this place has a huge following, but I don't think I'll be going here again."
1,"For breakfast the food was OK, but the service and service practice was TERRIBLE!\n\nOur waitress or hostess didn't offer coffee or water for close to 5 minutes after we were seated. The silverware on the table was dirty. We were served the wrong food. We only knew this by poking around in it. When they picked up the food - THEY SERVED IT TO THE APPROPRIATE TABLE! Now mind you we didn't spit in it or anything, but c'mon!\n\nWhen I asked the hostess to send the MOD over she sent the waitress instead. I was not happy about that. The waitress was disinterested and did nothing but make excuses for her errors. \n\nWe did not see her for the rest of the meal. My companion had to retrieve her own coffee.\n\nAll in all, and OK place to eat for breakfast if you want a decent meal before your start your day; just don't expect it to be a pleasant dining experience."
3,"Zipps is one of my favorite places to grab a beer and watch a game!  Let's appreciate Zipps for what it is:  a sports bar with decent grub (not a foodie dinner destination).  I'm a complete sucker for the specials that Zipps runs.  Here are my personal favorite highlights from their deals menu:\n\nHappy hour weekdays from 3-7pm:\n$6 Wings (my favorite are the \""golden medium\"")\n$2.75 well drinks\n$3.75 excessively large domestic drafts\n\nAlso, there are daily specials from 8-close.  (So let's think about this:  during the week there is a special going on from 3pm-close except for 60 minutes between 7-8pm, awesome, right?!?!)  \n\nMy personal favorite day for the evening specials is Tuesday for the Zipps burgers.  On Tuesday from 8-close the burgers are $5 and $6.50 for specialty burgers.  These things are friggin' huge.  Every single one comes with two patties. Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday highlight $1.50 pizza slices.  I think they are \""meh\"" as they are just slices with whatever toppings you add that are popped into an oven and reheated for a bit.  \n\nMy favorite specialty burgers are:\n\nGREEN CHILI BURGER:  A double stack with pepper jack cheese, New Mexico green chilies & green bay chili on the side.\n\nCHICADO:   Two ground chicken or turkey burger patties, pepper jack cheese, fresh guacamole & fried onion straws.\n\nHOT & SWEET:  Pickled jalapenos & our hot but sweet southwestern BBQ sauce, creating the hot but sweet contradiction.\n\nI often find myself in recovery mode at Zipps for the \""Weekend Hangover Special\"".  From 11am-4pm specialty burgers are on special for $6.50 and bloody Marys are $4.  The Bloody Marys are nothing special at Zipps--this is one part of Zipps that has room for improvement.  Give me some more pickles, cheese, peppers, other accessories, pretty please!  Buckets of beer (5 long-necks) retail for $12 during this time too--they are also essential to the weekend hangover recovery, so go for it!  ;)"
2,"Not bad, but not blow-your-mind awesome...\n\nCame here for a friend's birthday.  Stayed on a Friday night in January and the rates weren't terrible.  I believe we paid $115 a night.\n\nAs has been mentioned, the rooms were very modern in design.  Note, not modernist.  ;)  Lots of black and silver, shiny surfaces...  (for the cocaine?)  Not really my taste, but I'm not holding that against them.  It was very slick looking and consistent.  Everything in the room seemed to be in good shape except for two of the outlets.  They didn't work at all.\n\nWe chose one of the rooms with a view of the pool.  By \""view of the pool\"" they really meant - view of the pool if we hadn't planted about 20 trees in between.\n\nOverall it's an ok place to stay if you are a rockstar or would like to be.  For me, it was a little too far from the strip (a mile) if you are a walker.  We took a lot of taxis so we wouldn't be drunk driving.  Also, from walking through the front doors to the elevators to the room is easily a 20 minute walk.  What the...!?  While it was cool walking past the cute tattoo guys, it KIND of sucks after you've been drinking for 6 hours and just want to pass out.  \n\nGiven the choice, I'll probably stay elsewhere in the future."
3,"This restaurant is one of a kind here in Vegas for overall experience. Although they no longer have the show, there are 6 different rooms in this entire venue. The decor is vintage chic and the food is innovative and whimsical. During dinner you will have live entertainment with musicians, singers, and dancers using all parts of the dining room. During their gig, the music is pretty loud so don't expect too much conversation but they are entertaining. Dinner style is meant for sharing but portion size for many dishes suggest to share for 2. \nFor dinner my highlights were the Crispy Chicken, Pork Belly, and Beet and Avocado Salad. I also really enjoyed their take on a strawberry shortcake. You have to try it Yum!! I wouldn't say I dislike any of the other things I ate, the others were just not memorable."
4,"Notorious Kitchen is a great place for lunch or dinner!  I came in to check out the burgers and I was not disappointed.  I got the Notorious BIG burger and it was perfect.  Even the sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty!!!  I love the comfortable atmosphere and the service was really good.  Thanks folks,  I will most definitely be back!!!"
0,"Me and my boyfriend are not picky people when it comes to food. But seriously? This place. No. Just... no.\n\nGood price. Not so good meat. How can you mess up brisket? HOW?! He couldn't even finish eating the meat (yes it is that bad) because according to him, it tasted really old. There were a few bugs around our area too which is a definite no-no to me. There was only one server on the floor and she certainly couldn't care less about us or the table behind us either. Well then..."
4,"My group had just finished a round of golf and needed some beers and burgers but didn't want to go to a chain....we found this place on Yelp, great place, great food!  As the song that was playing on the jukebox \""I love this bar\"" - Toby Keith\n\nWe'll be back again."
0,I'd give it zero stars if I could. Service...the worst. Food...yuk. Nice place but horrible restaurant. My advice...STAY AWAY!!!
2,"They have one of my all time favorite \""cheat\"" meals, chicken and waffles. But today the food was cold so I sent it back and the replacement plate was cold too. Made me wonder if they are keeping a bunch of plates lines up waiting for orders. I do like the menu variety and beer choices."
1,"As a buffet connoisseur (kind of an oxymoron like \""jumbo shrimp\"" or \""Walmart snob\"") and as someone who has gone to Vegas about once a year for the past 20 years, I have been to pretty much every buffet in Vegas, some many times. So how does Wicked Spoon compare to the Bellagio Gourmet Buffet (weekends only), which is still the best buffet in Vegas? Not very well.\n\nWhen you go to a buffet that costs almost $40, you're really not looking for variations on, say, chicken preparation. You can get chicken for under a couple of bucks a pound at almost any supermarket. Or at least if you are, you shouldn't be shelling out $40 for a buffet - just go to Old Country or Golden Corral.\n\nAt a $40 buffet, you're looking for a large selection of relatively expensive foods. At the Bellagio Gourmet Buffet, which I went to one night before Wicked Spoon, there was Peking duck, prime rib, Chilean sea bass, kobe beef, sushi (with actual raw fish), poke (sashimi prepared Hawaiian style), etc. - you can't find a single one of these items at more pedestrian buffets.\n\nWhat do you get at Wicked Spoon? Only prime rib that's above ordinary and then fairly ordinary ingredients prepared slightly fancifully and presented in uppity small metal containers that are made in France. It's just not really close and it's only something one appreciates if one is not a true foodie and loves pretense.\n\nGo to the Bellagio."
1,"I think my girl hyped this place up too much.  She had gone to Montreal the year before and SWORE BY IT.  It was our last morning in Montreal before getting back on the road to head back home, so I made a point of eating there before I left.  Honestly?  It was just Denny's with crepes.  Nothing fancy. Ok - maybe Baker's Square with crepes.  Would I go again? Sure.  But I definitely wouldn't expect anything more than a solid effort at breakfast food.  It's really just \""ok\"""
0,"This place was a nightmare for me. I understand that there are people that love love love to do weird shit like hit the stores at 5am the day after Thanksgiving to do their x-mas shopping, punch other people in the face and threaten their lives for that \""last fucking furby\"", and shop at Last Chance.... I'm just not one of them. \n\nI'm not saying I'm better than you....... oh, who am I kidding, yes I am."
4,This place is amazing. With a city as huge as Phoenix/Scottsdale and only a handful of places that actually have REAL ORGANIC healthy food it is incredibly refreshing to stumble across Kaleidoscope!!! A neighbor turned me onto them. I had an amazing salad and coffee. The staff was very friendly and informative. If you care what you put into your body check this place out ASAP!!!
1,"I was so excited to try this place because of its close proximity to my casa & they have a Groupon this week! Duh. When I saw someone's picture of a Mexican Pizza, I was sold. The chips & salsa were decent (especially considering their free-ness), but everything else was very sub-par compared to other Mexican restaurants. I let my husband handle the ordering because he always complains about the \""weird\"" stuff I order, so we got the Mexican pizza & surprisingly, you can choose the protein that goes inside! He chose the shredded beef since I've seen many good reviews for it, as well as the huge Super Mex carnitas burrito. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to LOVE the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell. I thought it was the best thing ever, so crispy & fatty & what not. The Mexican pizza looked great, until I tried to get a piece. It was so soggy I had to use two forks to pick it up and we all had to eat it with a knife & fork because we couldn't pick it up like the Mexican pizza of my childhood. In hind sight, I think that the shredded beef may not have been the best choice to go on a Mexican pizza because it's usually swimming in juice right before they ladel it. I MAY try this again with steak next time (if there is one), or just something that's not so watery. Another problem I had with it was that some of the chunks of shredded beef were WAY too big. I had one that was 2in. x 2in. Who wants a piece of beef that huge in a fallen apart Mexican pizza? Not me! I want my beef actually shredded thanks, not the cow delivered to me to shred. \n\nThe carnitas burrito was pretty gross. My favorite carnitas is from the Amigos Tacos, not far from here, but this carnitas was shredded, dry, and chewy. Wamp. They also put crappy iceberg lettuce in their burritos which I should have read and asked for them to exclude. I think iceberg lettuce has a crappy flavor when combined with Mexican food because it tastes so bitter. They just don't go together. So, bill pre-Groupon was $22. Not bad considering the amount of food we got. We actually brought home the majority of the burrito which is surprising because I'm usually a food disposal and I never had left overs, but unfortunately, I didn't think any of this food was worth the calories so I didn't do my standard over-eating. Hey, I guess this place is great if you're on a diet, because you won't have too much that's edible and enjoyable."
1,"I recently decided to dye my virgin hair a lighter shade of golden brown and I was very nervous. Everyone tried to talk me out of it because they said I had such beautiful hair, why change it? I said no. I really want this.\nHuge mistake. After having driven by HOT BOX a few times and looking them up online I decided to make an appointment a week in advance. When I arrived the blonde receptionist (with an attitude) said 'Can I help you?' Not 'Hi. Welcome to HOT BOX' or even a smile. When I ask for the stylist I'm supposed to see, again with an attitude, she says 'Do you have an appointment?' As if I had just asked her 'Hi can I give you mono?'\n\nThe appointment started out great. My hair stylist was very nice and attentive and my fear was starting to subside. And it didn't hurt the salon was super cute! I showed my stylist 6, I repeat 6, different pictures of the same person with the same color that I was looking for. We talked about it for a minute and then she set off to work. By the time she was drying my hair it became quite evident she had just highlighted my hair with orange red streaks. This is NOT at all what I showed her. She also spent like two seconds trimming my hair when she just said my hair didn't need trimming. I am not one for confrontation so I said thanks and paid my $160( $40 of that was for my one minute trim). Yes I still tipped her because she was so nice.\n\nI was so miserable my friends convinced me to call her and ask her to fix it. Fast forward to today I now have yellow highlights mixed in with my orange red ones and I look like a chola from east LA. Which I could live with if they were done correctly. When I lift the sides of my hair for a pony tail, or half pony tail, or to braid it it looked like I have 3 month old roots on the sides of my head.I JUST went the day before last. WTF. I am now on my way to a different salon to dye my hair back to my normal color and I'm PROBABLY never going back to HOT BOX or dying my hair again. Sorry to all those of you who work there who can actually give their clients what they ask for and to the owner because your salon is super cute."
0,"We will not stay here again. Parking was insane and we we couldn't get valet because we weren't casino members. Other casinos in Vegas we have not had this issue. We had to park way out behind the wheel and cart our items in the heat. The parking garage was conveniently full. We got in and staff was not overly friendly. In the room the hardwood floor was nice but our shower leaked all night and the walls were dingy. We won't stay here again, you get what you pay for in Vegas."
1,Two stars at best.  Service was slow and poor. Food was marginal at best. Came here in hopes of being quick and decent and was disappointed on both accounts. Pass on this place no matter how hungry or tired you might be.
0,"Did not like the hotel style setting, or the fact that you cannot open windows, and had no balconies.  \n\nSis is a VIP member, so they upgrade one bedrooms to 2 at no cost, which is cool, but rooms are over priced and there is NOTHING to do on site.  \n\nLobby is far from some rooms, and no one tells you how to get where you are going.  We had to walk around pool area dragging luggage behind us, as staff watched us pass by and never offered directions or assistance.  \n\nDon't waste you're money or your time."
0,"2 burgers, 2 onion rings, 2 drinks = $30?  Why??? Ordered:  1/2 lb chili burger w/grilled onions. \nNot too difficult, right? WRONG!! \nReceived: 1/2 lb burger (no grill marks or taste) which looked like those frozen, robot formed burgers you see in the grocery store. BLAND!! A salad dressing sized cup of what they call great chili.  NOT!! Oh, and (2) raw red onion rings on a giant, non-toasted bun. BLAND!! Not so great customer service. The counter person was unsure of what a chili burger was!! I'm going to in&out! C-ya"
3,Best part of our trip to Vegas was renting a Honda Goldwing from these guys. Easy renting. Smooth process. Price for us for 24 hrs was $170 plus tax. Helments and gloves provided.  We did our own GPS.  They are open daily.  \n\nWhen we returned the bike there wa a sign to call a # as they had stepped out.  Ordered our own cab only for the guy to roll up and offer to call a company he's aligned with for cab business as it's too hard to get anyone to come out there.  \n\nGoldwing was just like ours at home. Carefully taken care of and it was a great experience. DEFINITELY would do it again.  Highlight of our trip.
2,On the rare occasions thst I go to Mill this is always a staple. The staff is friendly and eager to assist. And the selection is good and varied.
3,"Most important thing to know here is: TAKE YOUR OWN WINE.\n\n They do not have any wine, or beer, or any sort of alcoholic beverage. So if you don't want to be washing down your amazing Quebecois/Greek cuisine with a diet sprite, buy a nice bottle and carry it with you. Also, the convenience store across the street has vinegar for wine and its dear.\n\nNext, there will be a line outside. It took me nearly an hour to get in, in the Montreal winter. Well worth it for a good meal.\n\nRight past that little hurdle, the food is amazing. Large hearty portions of whatever you order; I had the lamb and it was fantastic. The bread they serve it with is fresh and fluffy like a pastry, and the salad dressing - complimentary salad - was just the best dressing I've ever tried.\n\nSo truth is I went here after I got turned away from Au Pied Couchon (across the street), which some people will claim is the best restaurant in Montreal and hence obviously requires reservations six years in advance (and don't try to claim you're from their courteous neighbour in the south, it makes things worse). Fantastic decision in the end."
4,"\""Where the eff is 115?!\"" \nThis was an overused phrase while walking up and down Laurier looking for Baldwin Barmacie as the store numbers got bigger and smaller at random. I was determined to find this place though because out of all the pre-trip research I did, Baldwin Barmacie was on my \""must see\"" list. \n\nVisiting Montreal for the weekend and wanting to get out of the main tourist spots, my friend and I decided to make the trek to the Miles End-ish neighborhood. After a wrong turn off the Metro, a failed attempt at bar #1, hands and noses that were chilled to the core and the frustration of actually finding the place, once the bar was in sight, I knew right from the entrance that I was going to like it. \n\nBalwin Barmaice made me feel right at home, this place could easily be found on South Beach (minus the mandatory $2 coat check), offering a casual yet trendy vibe where the clientele were upscale and the decor streamlined with a gimmicky twist, using retro bottles to mimic old fashioned pharmaceutics and unique lighting and chandeliers which casted a romantic glow on the place. At 9:30, Baracie was already picking up and seats were in high demand. My friend and I were able to score 2 stools at the bar where a number of bar tenders came to our service. \n\nThe menu was in an english/french hybrid, but the waitstaff was affable and happy to answer any of our questions. I ended up ordering some mac n' cheese complimented with a peach bellini and my bestie got a grilled cheese with a \""miss Baldwin\"" which was some sort of strawberry vodka mixed with something refreshing. The food was yummy and hit the spot. My drink was a tad on the small side, but tasty nonetheless. My friend's cocktail was delish and a good size. I don't think either drink was all that strong; I'm a lightweight and usually it only takes one cocktail to make me feel the alcohol swirling around my brain. Didn't feel a thing here though. \n\nBalwin Barmacie offers a great atmosphere and fair prices, their drinks could use some more conviction but all in all a really great spot!"
4,"A few years ago, I went to the M&M's factory and thought, \""how could someone be so into candy?\""  Later that year, I developed a sweet tooth that now leads me to places with names like \""Sugar Factory.\""\n\nAs soon as I walked in, I was in heaven.  It looked like something out of a Christmas movie or Willy Wonka.  Plus there was lots of pink, glitter and Hello Kitty- so totally my thing.\n\nThe shirts, clothes and non-food items were oh-so-cute. Believe it or not, I'm not a HUGE candy person.  I love sweets, but I'm more of the dessert type. This place had the BIGGEST cupcakes, brownies and meringue I have ever seen.  The problem is, I was kind of overwhelmed the first day.  We said we would come back the next day, but I got too sick.  I had my friend pick up the cutest shot glass for me there. It was a more reasonable $7 as opposed to those ridiculous $25 lollipops.  My friends got a few different types of candy.\n\nI had so much fun just walking around here picking up the 50ish pound teddy bear and looking at all the desserts.\n\nI feel like I shouldn't give this place 5 stars because I didn't get to eat the stuff.  But then, its not their fault I got too sick to walk there right...? :/ As far as selection for a edible museum of candy, sweets and just cute things in general goes, Sugar Factory wins if you are the sweets, pink, fluffy, puppies, Hello Kitty and rainbow kinda girl. :)"
0,"This place is as dead as it was when it was \""Light\"".  It terrible how most of these small club s are now filled with mom's and dads and grandmas  =/"
3,"My first time to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. I enjoyed it overall. They have a great patio. It's a great place for watching a game.  I was there with some gals for Happy Hour and to watch the Cardinals baseball game.  I ordered a margarita. The server, Brittany, said they have a skinny margarita which was fine with me. She brought it to me and this margarita looked dark and brown not the typical yellow/lime and goldish color. I always drink margaritas, there was no chance this was a margarita.  It had no tequila in there, it tasted like there was whisky in it. All the other ladies at the table tasted it and thought the same thing, this was no margarita. I told the server about it, she said it was a pre-made mix.  That's fine with me if it's a pre-made skinny margarita mix, it just needs to have tequila in it.  She was apologetic, I told her it wasn't her fault and she didn't make it. Brittany took it off the bill and I got a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheeseburger off the HH menu and got The Staple Mac n Cheese, both were amazing.  I'm looking forward to going back for great food, amazing service and the fun atmosphere."
0,"Sub par service, sub par food, above par prices, and me and my wife both felt like we were going to vomit an hour after eating here. What more could one ask for?"
0,"Sadly, this is not a good representation of Vegas, you can find places for as cheap or cheaper, and actually clean.\n\nPositives:  Margaritaville, Location on the strip\n\nNegatives: Dirty (there was even something spilled or, well...on the side of the chair in the room), $14 per day for Internet. Old and unmaintained, terrible customer service (when I asked a house cleaner if they could come back in 10 minutes, after I was gone, I was told \""I dont want to come back\""), Noisy (we were on the 15th floor and it was like we were down on the street), uncomfortable bedding, even though it was a non-smoking room, everything in there smelled like old smoke, did I mention dirty!!, they didnt have the room we requested, so instead of upgrading us for free, they offered to downgrade our room, witnessed two employees fighting (thats always a nice touch)\n\nObviously I didn't have a good experience, which is too bad, with the prime location on the strip, they could do so much more with this place."
4,Great New Look for $12! I went in for eyebrow threading since I can't wax due to having senstive skin. First time hurt some but the results are worth it! Anita knows how to shape your brows to make you look great. I'll be back in 4 weeks!
0,"UNDERCOVER CAMERA'S IN THE BATHROOM STALLS!!!\n\nNo lie, they have camera's in the stalls at this night club!  \n\nChances are they can see your what you're working with, GUYS AND GIRLS! \n\n Even the security admits it but I told the cops in Vegas and they didn't believe me.  PROOF anything happens in Vegas!!\n\nTHEY ILLEGALLY PUT THE CAMERA'S IN INSIDE OF THE STALLS TO STOP DRUG USE, BUT WHAT'S HILARIOUS IS THE MAIN SECURITY GUY I TALKED TO WAS ON DRUGS.... BLOW was the culperate, good GUY... BUT HAVE SOME  TACT AND SET THE EXAMPLE....??."
3,"Best Sushi I have had in Arizona.\nSince moving from San Francisco 3 years ago I have searched for a sushi place I liked.  Large lunch portions, friendly staff, good food...REAL Crab and Lobster options!\nYUM"
0,"I recently got an eye exam - as an engineer I spend hours on the computer and was due for a new pair.   Just relocated to Vegas and have gone to other Lenscrafters so I started my serach here. I spent ~20 minutes trying on frames in this store.  (I will say, they had a decent selection.  That is only positive note of my experience).  \n\nUpon walking out of the store, the manager ran out after me and said \""We just called the police, and have you on camera, I wouldn't go anywhere\"".  HUH?!? WHAT? I was dumbfounded.  Apparently \""someone\"" said they saw me put a bunch of frames in my bag.  I opened it for her and it contained:  my wallet, my cell phone, my car keys, and my own pair of $5 sunglasses.  I am not a thief.  Just a girl trying to shop for glasses.\n\nIf being called a thief in front of the 15 or so people in the store isn't bad enough, I actually had to go back in and ASK for an apology.  They said they've had a run of thefts lately.  I can understand, everyone makes mistakes, but when you do, especially when it is to a customer, you should offer an apology.  I was told me that the way I was treated was NOT rude because \""someone\"" had seen me stealing (which had already been proven to be untrue when she checked my bag)\n\nI was also told in an assertive tone that \""No one comes here to browse, they come to buy glasses\"".  Wrong.  Every time I've purchased glasses, I have tried on several (many times at other Lenscrafters), done my homework on who has the best best price, and gone back to purchase.  (PS- this is a great way to not get ripped off.) \n\nI hope they enjoy reviewing that camera footage of me BROWSING and not stealing, and I sincerely hope that in the future, no other customers are treated in the humiliating manner that I was.   \n\n(Obviously, I will be buying my shiny new glasses elsewhere)."
2,"Two issues: The El Machino tortilla station was devoid of people and the salsa was way spicier than I recall in any CA Chevy's. It was so spicy that this white boy was sweating through the cheap paper napkins (5) that this place provides. Another free birthday meal and chicken fajitas were the choice. Chicken was sliced too thin,  but had no trace of the promised spices and chilies. It was just grilled chicken with plenty of onions and peppers and the usual condiments. Still, a solid safe choice for a chain, but not sure why every waiter in the bar was gay. Nothing wrong with that, but both my waiter and my chip and salsa guy were on the other team and that was a bit unusual. Also, I know it's a Mexican chain, but we are in America and nobody really needs to listen to full-on Mexican tunes during dinner. IF i want the full experience, I will just go the east side of Vegas and find some taco joint with bars on the windows."
1,"5 stars for the hosting hotel (Aria), but Haze is underwhelming. The layout itself is pretty cool, but the music is SO wack. Sorry, Mister DJ(s), but music will make it or break it for a girl like me who loves to dance. So I got kind of bored here after like an hour.\n\nWe went here twice in the same weekend, mainly because we were staying in Aria and Haze was brand new. The first night was actually pretty legit because we headed straight there after the drive from California, so got into the club around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.? So by then, all the bouncers were off their high horses and we got hooked up with tons of free drinks and good times. Then we went the next night when Keri Hilson was slated to perform. Not as fun a time, too crowded, and WHO THE HECK plays GREEN DAY's \""Time of Your Life\"" for people to dance to at a club?! Uh, NOT okay if you're trying to create a poppin' Vegas party. \n\nBTW, we never even got to see that beezy Keri perform because she was way lagging, and we were there that night until like 2:30 a.m.! By that time, I decided I'd rather sleep than wait for her to \""knock us down.\"" Long hair, no longer care. Come here after a long night at another club at around 3 or something when your night's winding down."
0,"Love the chain, hate the poor slow service at this location. Why do I have to wait 13 minutes for 5 cars in front of me? Drive through isn't intended to be a parking spot. Mgmt needs to wake up!!"
1,"I guess GREAT sounds better than FAIR Greek Grill, but that's what it is, fair compared to the Greek in Houston, Chicago, Denver, etc.  The Gyros were flavorful but dry and some pieces slightly crunchy.  The salad wasn't very Greek: a sprinkle of Feta and 2 kalamata olives drenched in a way-too-oily dressing? Come on.  The tzatziki only tasted of yogurt, no other flavors, so thank goodness they had Sriracha.  Fries were standard.  The pita was good.  I didn't get Baklava because it wasn't shiny as all other Baklava I've eaten has been.  The woman at the counter seemed bothered by me despite my 20% tip paying at the counter.  She didn't even give me a water cup.  She just wanted to chat with a couple of regulars.  If you don't know Greek, it'll be bomb.  If you do...this place will disappoint."
4,Great customer service here!! We were treated wonderful and the food was delicious.  Will be back for sure.
1,Very dissapointing. Last visit 2 years ago was very good.  Everything slow with many mistakes.\nToo many choices to pull me back. Food was good.
1,"Was attracted to this sushi restaurant by a coupon on weluvlocals.com.  This place isn't really bad, but I didn't find it especially out of the ordinary, and thought it was very expensive even with a coupon.    \n\nThe upside for this place is the atmosphere, which is nice.  If you are willing to pay up for atmosphere and like to be forced to eat very little food by way of high prices, this place may be for you.  It is not for me.\n\nWaiter was courteous, but pushy and big on the upsell.  Under pressure and not having seen the price on the menu, we succumbed to ordering a $5 plate of edamame which was small, maybe about 20 to 30 pods.  We resisted his suggestion of mineral water.\n\nCalifornia roll was edible but nothing special, with the usual \""krab\"".\n\nThe other roll we got we didn't care for at all.  Forgot what it was called but it was one of their rolls with a wacky name.  While we generally try to be adventurous with foods, we often find that ordering sushi rolls that we are not familiar with usually turn out to be a disappointment.  Some of the rolls we often order as a safe bet, such as the caterpillar and the rainbow, were not on the menu.  \n\nMiso soup is a la carte for $5/bowl.  We did not order any.\n\nChicken Yakisoba ($16) was below average, even when compared to other much less expensive restaurants.  Noodles were sticky and slightly greasy.  I wouldn't normally order this but I was very hungry and in need of some filler, and was concerned that I wouldn't otherwise get out of this place with a full stomach for under $100.\n\nAlso, my beer was brought to me and it was warm.  I sent it back and it was replaced with another brand, but I was charged full price even though it was not my desired beer, without any other compensation offered.  I didn't bother trying to argue for a free beer because I just wasn't in the mood and didn't care that much.\n\nOrder included the plate of edamame, small sashimi, 1 california roll, one other roll, and chicken yakisob.  Plus one 22-oz beer and one glass of wine.\n\n\nTotal for 2 people with tax and tip, less $25 off coupon, was $72.  I could eat the same thing in Sacramento in an equivalent restaurant for about $45 inclusive, without a coupon.  Shall not return."

3,"A trendy open concept Spanish-fusion restaurant with light, tasty tapas located on the restaurant level (3rd floor) of the Cosmo Hotel, Vegas - ideal for groups, girls especially, looking for a light meal with some drinks. \n\nDressed to the nines, my 3 girlfriends and I dined here before going to XS at Wynn. It's contemporary in design and concept, which made for great ambience. The service was slow and servers were not very attentive, but the tapas were all very good - light and tasty. I'd recommend 4-6 shared among four girls to feel comfortable. The menu items have Spanish headlines with descriptors in English, which made it a little more confusing then need be for selecting tapas, but that's just me being picky. In the end, it was exactly the type of restaurant we were looking for :)\n\nTapas we shared: See photos\n\n- Seared salmon w/ cauliflower & raspberry puree, $9 | Unique & Flavourful - Highly Recommend!\n- Classic chilled Spanish soup, $7 | Light, Summery, Refreshing - Recommend!\n- Endives w/ goat cheese, oranges & almonds, $7 | Tasty, but very small & light (4 endive leafs)\n- Spanish omelet, $8\n\n- Popular Specialties: Pan con tomate w/ Serrano ham (This looked delish, wish we tried it!) and Paella (Jaleo's Signature)"
1,I came to this movie theater to see Blind Side.  I never made it through. All of the self-ticketing machines were broken.  The lines were long beyond belief.  They were out the doors.  I arrived 30 minutes early for the movie and I wasn't about to waste my time in an hour long line -- especially when the majority of the line was composed of Tweeny and Teen girls.  Apparently the movie New Moon had just come out.  I found out later what New Moon was and so I will return to this theater when it has not been taken over by screeching and screaming young girls that can pop one's ear drums when they see their current heart throb.  \n\nAt least the girls appeared to be enjoying their time at the theater.
3,Great bar. Really good prices (best in Oakland?). They have darts for cheap which is sweet. It is very smoking friendly.
2,"I came here for Zoo Lights for the first time last week. Since everyone I knew who's been in the past already said it's such a waste of time and money, I had low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! It was very beautiful - the lights made into different animals was impressive.  \n\nPros: A nice date night or stroll around the zoo if you are looking for something chill to do. Certain areas have light shows. Not sure if they actually have a schedule, but I happened to be at 2 at the right time, so that was cool. \n\nI liked the area right past the stingray bay exhibition. \n\nCons: It is a little pricey, so not sure if I would come ever year or more than once a year. The whole zoo isn't open to explore, only certain sections. They also have activities like the slide, but it's $3/ride!!! A bit steep for a 10 second ride. \n\nIf you've never been, I would say go at least once. Or take little ones who can help you appreciate the simplicity of nature decorated in pretty lights. They're kettle corn is good! \n\nAnd if you have SRP, look out for the inserts. They have a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free admission!"
2,"So torn about this review because it wasn't the food that was bad, it was the young man at the register. He was very nice but my God was he scatterbrained, unorganized and just plain not good at his job. He seemed too overwhelmed for the small lunch rush that was there. We ordered the cranberry turkey sandwich and the Yucatan salad. He brought out the sandwich and never gave us the salad. So we waited....and my friend finally just gave me the other half of his sandwich and after 20 minutes, just asked for our money back. The sandwich was so good and the pastries looked amazing but we just wanted to go after being there for so long without so much as a heads up about an ETA of our salad. Restaurants run into problems, but it's the way you handle it that brings people back. We overheard the guy behind us as we were leaving say to the young man...   \""hey, can I please just have my damn sandwich\"" . So, obviously, we weren't the only ones with issues. Small businesses like that are usually a popular spot, they need to hire someone up front that knows what's going on especially in that restaurant and test them on the menu. He was absolutely clueless."
2,"If you are staying at the LVH and need a quick bite or margarita, I would recommend stopping by for some quesadillas and a drink.  I did not have a full meal, so cannot comment on the rest of the menu.  It was a pleasant place to enjoy a drink, but you do have to listen to all Motley Cru music, as you might imagine."
0,"Please read this before you go. This might save you from a bad experience.\n\nWe read the reviews on yelp and came here. We were surprised to see the limited items on the menu. And we thought that with only a steak to make, it must be masterfully done.\n\nFour of us entered and were greeted by the only lady who wasn't in uniform. The place had a nice vintage, faded glory vibe. We sat down at a table in front of the bar and waited for about 5 minutes before we got our water. The lady who served us, in fact everyone in the resto, looked like they were working in the army: no smile, angry-looking, albeit self-efficient and prompt. We were intimidated to even ask for anything and felt like eating in training camp. It was very awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nThe steak was disappointing (and that's the only thing they make too). We ordered the steak medium rare and medium, but all the meat was tough even to the knife. We doubted the quality of the meat was acceptable. The carrot soup was nice and refreshing, however. Fries were crispy and the bread was fluffy. The dessert tasted like something you'd find at a college dining hall.\n\nIt was a scar to our trip to Montreal. We trusted yelp and went but the service was horrible, and the only table d'h\u00f4te offered was subpar, even for the price. We argued that we could have gotten nicer steaks at Chili's in the United States for the same price."
2,Good. The hummus was really good. Close to Homemade. \nNot enough lamb flavor in the meat. Perhaps more mutton is needed. \nGood value.
4,"we keep driving by this place thinking it was just a coffee house. but after reading some of yelps reviews, learned it was much more. it's so cute and trendy inside. they have so many yummy and healthy options, we didn't know what to pick. so we decided to go with the veggie breakfast burrito.\n\nit was light and filling, much to our surprise. and superbly tasty. and best of all, not gigantic. more places should do that....offer reasonably priced food, that tastes great, in manageable portions. that way, you don't stuff your face with a giant food plate and then feel like an obese slob the rest of the morning. \nwe'll hit this place up again for sure. awesome staff too!!!!"
2,"Their sandwiches are good, but not my favorite. Fries and cole slaw on my sandwich just aren't my style. Always dirty in the store, I don't mind brushing a few crumbs off the table but darn it, clean up a little."
0,"They always have had bad service, but the wings always made up for it.  But now the wings are average at best. Today was the last time for me."
4,"They could have come up with a better name, but I am not gonna fault them for that. We were in Scottsdale for a get-away week and I had brought my most recent Sunset Magazine with me to read and lo n behold, they had a little blurb on this joint. \n\nWe got there about 10 minutes before their 2200 quittin' time. I had the Basil Lime sorbet as well as the fig and bleu cheese ice cream pairing. Wow! These women are brilliant- great job of executing their concept. Now, if they could/would only distribute to San Diego! MMMMMM, Cowboy Ciao for dinner and this place for dessert and Cash Inn Country for a little nightlife. Perfect combination."
0,"I've gone here for lunch a few times, since it's close to my office.  The food is decent, not really a Brooklyn Deli, but good sandwiches.  This week I went again, and the level of service was horrible.  \n\nThe line when I arrived was around 15 people.  Half the staff was not servicing the line, and a couple others appeared to be just wondering around, not doing anything.  When I finally got to the counter after 15 minutes of waiting,  instead of them making my sandwich, a different employee started arguing with them about how they had screwed up previous orders.  So they argued about this for a while before one of them stoppe makingthe sandwich he was making to remake others, all while the counter was full of people waiting to eat.  \n\nWhen I finally got my sandwich I had to wait in another large line to pay.  They had one person working the cash register, and he was clearly overwhealmed and confused.  They did not have anyone try to come help him.  I was finally able to pay and get my lunch, in all it took 30 minutes to get a sandwich made.  \n\nI emailed the manager to let him know about the experience, he made some excuses, didn't seem to care about his employees taking a half hour to make a sandwich.  \n\nI think there used to be a different manager there who always worked the register, and things ran smoothly, but the last couple times he has not been there."

Ainsi, les livres sont expos\u00e9s de face sur les tables et il est ais\u00e9 de bouquiner. Cependant, si on cherche un titre en particulier, on a peu de chance de le trouver dans cette librairie.

1,"It is the ONLY place in concourse C that looked halfway decent... and that's about the best thing that can be said of it. The food was okay, the portion reasonable (smaller than I'd have expected at a Mexican place, but frankly that is probably a good thing), prices not too bad. \n\nOf course, there is no metal silverware and the service is a step up from the TSA, but not exactly great.\n\nAnd while the beer and non-alcholoic drinks were a bit expensive, they DID offer me a $4 shot to go with my beer. So they've got that going for them...\n\n2.5 stars"
4,so cheap and so good...best in phoenix!
0,"Horrible customer service from the manager... the food is standard Panera Bread quality and not worth a trip back to this location. I walked in on 12/28, Sunday morning, Melissa the cashier was friendly and efficient. Then the manager, who was unorganized, running around (it wasn't busy) and creating a chaotic atmosphere appeared. Her name was Jessica, as I asked the cashier before I left. She didn't smile or offer a greeting to customers, instead she was rudely speaking to the team (complaining about a new person not understanding how to make a drink and being overwhelmed herself). The cashier and another team member were making 2 smoothies which had been ordered, 1 of them was mine. All was good then Jessica haphazardly delegated other tasks to the team members. My smoothie was finished mixing but needed to be poured into a cup. I asked if she could pour mine before moving on to the next one so my order could be completed. She said, \""sir I know you want me to be 15 people but I'm only one person!\"". I responded, \""focus on finishing 1 task before moving on to another.\"" In addition, the team serving the sandwiches is average at best. Engage your team and delight your customers to ensure repeat business and you'll also be able to take down the \""now hiring\"" sign. This Panera is lacking in both areas and I will not be returning, it's simply not worth it in terms of value."
4,"As far as buffets goes, this is the best I have ever experienced. I am someone who cannot stand buffets because of the germs that often comes with the name. However, Bacchanal Buffet is the exception. The restaurant was extremely clean as they staff constantly wiping down counters and tables as well as changing out old pans including serving utensils. \n\nI dined here back in March of 2014 when I was in Vegas for vacation. Because my boyfriend is a platinum member on some Vegas deal he has, we were able to skip the long line ( GREAT bonus) and be seated right away. We had a server who came and took drink orders and we were on our way to feast on great food!\n\nThe buffet is gigantic. It's almost overwhelmingly large to where you don't know where to start. They have different \""stations\"" offering a variety of food from salad bars, to BBQ, Italian, American, Asian, seafood, and so on. Because the buffet is so large, there were stations I missed completely because I never got around to visiting every station\n\n The best buffet to me was the dessert bar. Wow! Every dessert your heart desires they just about had. \n\nThey are expensive $50. However, the meal ended up being free for us because my boyfriend had over $400 worth of pts to use at restaurants so the cost didn't \""hurt\"" us. But even if we did had to pay out of pocket, it would have been worth every dollar. The food, the service, the atmosphere all were considered when dining here.\n\nI cannot wait to get back to Vegas so I can go back. You will not find a better buffet than Bacchanal Buffet."
3,"I finally made it over to Deville's this week! My sister and I didn't know where to have lunch so she suggested we go splurge. \n\nWe walked in and the place was packed, but didn't take long to get seated. Our waitress was a bubbly and charismatic young girl. Really friendly. \nMy sister did the ordering, we had the Tuna taco's and the philly cheese steak spring rolls.  \n\nWhen the plates came everything looked delicious. We decided to start with the fresh, melt in your mouth but messy taco's. I could have eaten all three myself and been satisfied! The sauce complimented the dish perfectly. My only complaint is how expensive it was. Man, an 18$ appetizer is just madness.\n\nThe philly cheese steak spring rolls were the decadent opposite of the Tuna. The meat was tender and tasty, the rolls are crispy, and the cheese sauce was ok. \nAll in all it was a great lunch, it also helped that is was my sister's treat! LOL\nWhen I saw the bill for 35$ on 2 apps, I was floored. \n\nI know you need to pay for quality and location but I think it could be slightly lowered.\nBut I'll be eating there again!"
2,"There are two things that Tao has lots of: 1) Buddhas and 2) stairs!\n\nMy girlfriends and I were all winded by the time we got to the rooftop area known as Tao Beach. Up there you will have a lovely view of the Venetian, Treasure Island, and construction! The setup is pretty sweet and cozy with the cabanas. Sending us up several flights of stairs must be their way of getting everyone thirsty enough to head to the bar order a drink. Lucky for them, it worked. My only gripe about Tao Beach is the long walk to the bathroom, which is in the pool area.\n\nI found that the dance floor downstairs to be on the small side. Music wasn't too bad, but it was also pretty forgettable. Nothing that the crowd got too riled up over. The confetti that rains on the crowd is pretty over the top, but hey, it's Vegas! Service at the bar was always speedy, to keep the buzz steady for the night.\n\nNot a bad experience, but not spectacular either. Overall, I had a lot of fun."
1,"Would have been three stars only because of the view but then service was very lacking so I kept it at 2 stars. Food is decent but not worth the price. The basics were lacking: e.g., water and bread service. The entrees came out while we were still eating our apps. Wait staff didn't know the particulars of the menu, etc. The view is great but doesn't make up for the rest of the problems."
0,"If you look closely at the sign, you'll notice the price is for regular is only if you use cash.  When you pull up to the pump there is a sign that states there's a credit or debit surcharge.  This price makes this Shell station more expensive than the already overpriced Circle K just across the street.  I expect the outdated credit/debit surcharge from Arco, or a small gas station, but not a Shell.  You can save yourself a couple of dollars by getting off the highway before/after the tunnel at 7th Ave.  Stations both north and south of the I-10 are cheaper on that street.\n\nThe plus sides of this station is that there's a lot more pumps than at most stations in the downtown area.  There's also a car wash.  There is just a tiny little spot in the middle with a cashier and a few convenience items, but no real store presence.  Maybe this Shell should build a store on the property, so it can increase profits by selling overpriced sodas and candy, and start charging less for gas."

0,"THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!  No customer service, and guess what??  They never showed at my house either.  No one ever answers the phone or replies to your emails.  Stay away from this company.  I had my hopes up too, for clean house and they never showed.  I've already let Living Social know, my next step is the BBB.  This company is a joke."
3,"I got business cards printed here. They had them done within 3 hours with good quality, just a bit pricey."
2,"What happened, Switch? You were awesome. You're still good, but I feel like some things have slipped.\n\n1. Quality of food doesn't seem as good. Last few times, the sandwich bread was hard and stale. Some of the appetizers were overpriced and seemed small for size and/or not so great in quality.\n2. Service has gotten a bit slow. I realize that new servers have to learn the system, but the learning curve is only so long.\n3. Food and drink specials have changed. Some stuff isn't as good a deal as it used to be.\n\nThat being said, I still have a good time when I go. It's just not my go to restaurant in Phoenix anymore."

1,"Dreadful service, delicious food...I went there last night for the first time. I was appalled by the poor service. We arrived around 8 pm on a Saturday night. The place was less than half full. We were seated outside, and the waitress came to take our order. I had questions about the wine, and asked if I could get a standard wine glass of Reisling. Then, a different waitress came, and poured me an extremely small glass of wine. I was not only shocked by the switch, but by her abruptness. When she returned again, I voiced my complaint about the wine and why I received such a small glass. (Seriously, it was only about 2 oz.) She said she would check with the bartender. Once she returned, she claimed that they had given me more than standard glass of Reisling and that the bartender had given me 3 oz instead of 2. At this point, I didn't want to argue any more. So I tried to order. Then, I was told the restaurant was out of most of the food I wanted! They were out of salmon, artichokes, arugula among other things. (Even with the wine incident and the shortage of food, no offer to comp us a drink or even an appetizer was forthcoming.) At this point, I was extremely disappointed and on the verge of leaving, but we found something to order. To our surprise, we ended up with a very good meal. So on the bright side, the food was absolutely delicious. It is sad that the service was so bad. I would like to go back for the food, but it is unlikely that I will do so."
0,12/15/12 Worst lunch I have eaten in years. Won't be back.  $43.00 RIP OFF.  Food was bad and uneatable.
3,"I've stayed at the PH westgate in a suite and met up with a group who were celebrating a birthday in one of the larger suites.  amazing layout of both rooms.  our suite had a bathtub, master bedroom, and large couch that slept 4.  6 of us fit quite comforably in the room and it was only $150/night at the time (some deal going on).  downstairs is the infamous earl of sandwiches with delicious tomato soup and of a good selection of yummy sandwiches.  pool is decent, buffet just okay, and a nice shopping area connected near the hotel.  can't go wrong with this centrally located hotel.  \n\ntook a pole dancing class at the \""stripper bar\"" which was a ton of fun.  highly reccommended for birthday/bachelorette parties."
1,"Must have been an off day, but I could have studied at the state fair...kids running around, babies crying, and two loud mouth women talking loud and eating cheetos! Ridiculous! Then the security waking around all stone faced saying nothing. Smh. Better luck next time I guess."
1,I went there to get my eyebrows done and I decided to get my lip waxed. I have an almond allergy and they used almond oil on my lip without telling me first. I started itching badly and finally asked her what they used and she said almond oil. Considering many people have a nut allergy they should switch to a different type of oil. My eyebrows did turn out well but they didn't comp me for the lip wax which is why I won't go back. I didn't make a huge deal about it when I left but by principal alone they should have tried to make things right. Where has the quality gone?
3,"Dr. Christine Tymczyna is a provider here at Healthy Outlook Family Medicine. I have searched for a good doctor since I moved to Phoenix. There are many that will just prescribe your medicine, or listen to about 30 seconds of what you have to say and make their assumptions but not Dr. T. \n\nShe is attentive and takes the entire picture into consideration. The back office staff is really nice, and the front office staff is better then most.\n\nMy only wish is that they took Cigna HMO, however knowing the insurance companies, I can understand why they do not.\n\nPROS: Early hours, as early as 6am, great doctor, nice staff\n\nCONS: The Owner will not let her doctor's take self pay patients."
3,"We've established that I love burgers.  Therefore, it is to be expected that the Liberty, which routinely claims to have the best burger in Charlotte award (from whom, I don't quite know), has been on my to-try list for quite a while.  We were in the area for dinner last night, and so we popped in.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is a relatively cool space.  There's a spacious bar room, which would be a good place to have a few drinks without feeling packed in.  The dining room is comfortable as well, and is decorated with beer kegs, beer quotes, etc.\n\nHowever neat the decor was, we came for the food.  And we weren't disappointed.  I was excited to see poutine on the appetizer menu, since I've wanted to try this Canadian specialty from the moment I first became aware of its existence.  I wasn't disappointed.  The porcini gravy on the fries was especially delicious.\n\nThe burger was pretty dang good, too.  Was in the best in Charlotte?  Well, maybe.  I reserve my full commitment because, while the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the toppings were thoughtfully selected, the bun was a little on the minimalistic side.  I actually had to finish it with a knife and fork.  Now, a burger with too much bread is a sad thing, but the Liberty has gone too far in the other direction.  Mind you, this is a minor quibble.  iIf you go here, get the burger.  It's dang tasty.  Just be prepared for messiness.\n\nI see some people have complained about the service, but our waitress was fine.  She wasn't super bubbly, but she was polite and kept our drinks filled.  What else can you ask for?"
2,"Sometimes you're just in the mood for old-school thin crust pizza, and when this mood strikes you're not going to do much better than Buck's.  I'm told they're a Madison institution and I can believe it.  Their thin crust pizza reminds me of the impossibly delicious pizzas of grade-school birthday parties and post-ballgame pizza parties.  Sweet tomato sauce, crispy thin crust and tons of cheese - this is the stuff memories are made of!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I usually go for Falbo's or Roman Candle for take-out in Middleton and I tend to prefer the fancy specialty pizzas like the Professional or the Italian Stallion.  But if I'm feeling nostalgic for a simple pepperoni and cheese (and there will be a lot of cheese, mind you) Buck's is the first place that comes to mind.  The place is take-out only and the hours definitely aren't for the late night crowd - I believe they close at 8:45 although the menu says 9.  The prices are very reasonable, especially if you don't add many toppings.  And finally, I haven't gotten this in years and I don't know if they still offer it, but you used to be able to get a \""ball of dough\"" for a buck, which you then could take home to make your own large pizza.  It was like DIY take and bake."
1,"They need to offer drink specials and giveaways during football games.  This is a Charger bar and I am a huge Charger fan however, there are other Charger bars that offer drink specials and fun giveaways.  The staff is very friendly...the food is mediocre."
3,"Went here looking for my first car, Knew they had a Toyota Avalon pre owned in the lot. Browsed around and a James Knab showed me the cars i requested and did what ever he could to answer our questions and assist us. Didn't feel hustled. Very helpful. Then again didn't buy from them so who knows how the whole haggling process could have been."
0,"Horrible experience.  Quoted $120 on phone. Showed up to make a key for my truck and within 10 minutes the price had jumped to almost $300. Then they claimed they couldn't get \""the codes\"" and that meant that it was going to cost nearly $500.  I sent them packing and had a new key made the next day for $175 total by U.S. Key.\n\nDefinitely use U.S. Key - and not these guys."
3,Love faustos! When me and the hubs are hungry and grumpy we go there and get carne asada fries. They put us in a good mood again! My only problem with this place is their quality of beef. A lot of times I'm chewing on gristle. But it's a small price to pay for A LOT of awesome food at at a great price!
1,"Service was fine though food was just ok, and probably bad given how expensive the food is.  We didn't even stay for dessert.  Had the dorito mac and cheese (overrated as it was normal mac with chips on top), philly cheesesteak drumstick (weird texture!), pulled pork egg roll (tasted like bland mush inside a fried wrap, where the wrap was too thick for the meat), and the scallops (best part of the meal).  I also tried my coworker's flank steak which was good flavor though overdone.  My other coworkers had the shrimp and grits, which looked lovely though were just ok.  Disappointed for my last meal in vegas."
4,"o.b.s.e.s.s.e.d.\n\nYes, that's right... s.e.e.d. is my new obsession... I cannot get enough of their fresh squeezed juices, healthy snacks, salads and sandwiches.\n\nI've lost count of the number of times I've visited, but it's definitely more than I can count on my fingers and toes, and I've always walked away a happy customer.  \n\nOver the weekend, I had a big birthday celebration and invited some friends to celebrate with me at the Madison Improvement Club.  We did a #partyonabike (spin) class with Brittny, a private flow yoga class with Beri, and had lunch catered by s.e.e.d right on the patio.  It was perfect in every way!\n\nI worked with Carly to plan it and she was OMazing... we ended up with the following menu for my group:\n\n*1 hummus platter\n*1 skinny dipping platter \n*1 Jaqlyn Salad \n*1 Kale 'em with Kindness Salad\n*1 Santa Maria Platter (wrap style)\n*1 Tune Up Platter (wrap style)\n*1 What She's Having Platter (wrap style)\n\nWe also had juice shots (The Walk, Conquer the World, Zinger).  \n\nEvery single person I spoke to raved about the food, and I loved it so much, I ate leftovers for dinner... on my birthday!\n\nIf I could give Carly, Jaqlyn, and Chef Joe more than 5 stars, I would... Thank you for making me the most perfect birthday lunch, and you can bet you'll see me back at s.e.e.d. again real soon!"
2,"I feel like the prices at Baskin Robbins keep increasing for standard ice cream.  Sure it always has that consistant taste no matter where you go, but I'd rather get frozen custard at Luv It or Nielsen's for the same (or cheaper) price with more flavor.\n\nMy friend and I went on Sunday and their A/C was out and it happened to be 117 outside.  If I had a choice between here and Coldstone, Coldstone would win easily."

0,"This place deserves 1 star. 1 star because not the quality of work but rather based on the experience I had on the estimate. I was greeted by a man name Jay. From reading all the reviews on yelp, I casted an opinion of Eco tint in my head that this place is friendly and willing to work with the customer. I was wrong...\n\nI went in about 5:00pm to get an estimate. After waiting 3 minutes or so someone finally helped me. As he greeted me I asked for an estimate for my 2004 Lexus is300. He paused for a second as if he didn't want to help me and my presence there is wasting his time. So he ran down the prices of the basic tint. As he forgot to mention and I had to bring up, I asked about the ceramic. He asked \""how often are you in your car?\"" I told him that rarely am I in my car but when I am I don't want to feel the heat as much. He told me that if I'm not in my car, 'Ceramic tint is a waste'. You guys heard it from the source. Ceramic tint is a waste he said. I'm like that's fine. After our discussion about ceramic we started to talk about front windshield tint. He said if anything needs to be ceramic the front windshield tint. I was definitely interested in that.\n\nAfter all that, I told him to write down everything on a piece of paper so I could look over when I get home. I'm doing tint shopping so I have every right to want to see numbers written down so I can decide. As I asked him to write it down, it was as if he didn't want to. He wanted to sell right then and there... After that he immediately looked into availability in the system. I didn't even ask or tell him I was going to bring my car in. He was really trying to up sell saying that \""we get tons of appointments and sometimes if you call your car won't be ready to be worked on until next month\"" after that I was immediately turned off. \n\nJay gave me this price for my car. $229 for the basic tint (a little steep in my opinion) \n\nAdditional options: \n\n$125 for front windshield \n\n$75 for any ceramic upgrade. \n\nTint comes with warranty but does not cover accidental warranty. You would think for the price it would be?? \n\nWay too much for tint!! I'm not going to knock off their business but if you're going to get tint, SHOP AROUND! And the person trying to sell you tint should understand that. He compared shopping around for tint as 'apples to oranges' exclaiming you won't get a better deal anywhere else. I stand corrected. People do your research. Know what you want. \n\nIf you want good workmanship go here I guess. But if you want to feel pressured and feel bad for asking little things so their business can survive, go here I guess lol. Definitely taking my hard earned money somewhere else."
4,"So peaceful on a Sunday morning, as any coffee house should be. I was only able to try two things: a breakfast burrito and an iced mocha.\n\nThe iced mocha was on par with Panera's, which I love. It's more coffee than chocolate, just the way I like it. I practically inhaled that sucker...it never stood a chance.\n\nThe real surprise--and delight--was their breakfast burrito. Egg, spinach, tomato, cheese, and I think salsa. I didn't even know salsa was in it until I got the ends (it was cut in half cross-wise); normally a breakfast burrito with any type of sauce leaks like an old roof in a monsoon, but not this one. It was the neatest burrito I've ever had, and the addition of spinach and the MASSIVE tomato slices made it that much more fantastic. Do yourself a favor and try the burrito!\n\nAs for the staff, they are very sweet. You will be taken care of. :)"
4,"Well deserved 4 1/2 star rating., I give it a 5. Truly a mom & pop business,, operated by a husband and wife. The service is excellent, my veggie omelet was loaded with veggies & cooked perfectly and reasonably priced. The regular coffee is great and they also have expresso, etc. The menu isn't fancy,  just  basic, simple breakfast & lunch fare.  I served 2 of their fresh baked pies for Thanksgiving and it was unanimous among 10 people that they were outstanding.\n\nThis place is off the beaten path in Tempe's  industrial area but well worth seeking out. Try it, you'll like it."
0,"I just had a late lunch. The all you can eat sushi was not worth it. The food was not fresh. It was horrible!!! I've been here quite a few times but I don't remember the food tasting like this. First of all, the edamame was not eatable. I couldn't even get the peas out of the pods. The chicken skewers were dried and had a weird smell with it. Perhaps the meat was sitting out too long?? The sushi items we ate didn't taste fresh. Especially the tuna. We also ordered the green mussels which was burnt and ruin the rest of my appetite. Overall for lunch I should of starve."
1,"I was really disappointed. I have been to several Brazilian stake houses and this one doesn't even compare. Salad bar is weak, they are so stingy on the sides such at the cheese breads and friends bananas. And they are more expensive than the other brazilian steak houses. The service was fair. Nothing special. I am sure I won't go back to this place. The one in Scottsdale is worth the drive ."
4,"What's not too love about this place. They have everything I need for my outdoor needs. There is always someone available when you need help or if you just have ?'s , friendly and knowledgeable staff.\n  Since this my neighborhood store I can order stuff online have it shipped here and pay no shipping. \n  Ive now been a member for almost 20 years and about this membership I paid a one time fee of $15 and now I get 10% on everything I buy.\n  I would recommend this place to anybody into outdoor hobbies."
2,"I am a happy camper since there is finally a wing place in the area. Awesome concept for Wing Stop, definitely trying to put that competitive edge to BWW. The inside is smaller than what is looks from the outside, but still pretty spacious with bar and dinning area. I ordered the boneless with buffalo and Parmesan garlic and side of Cajun fries. The buffalo was pretty standard, but from other Wing Stops I've had in the past this Parmesan garlic was just okay. The seasoning on the fries was rather strong and almost not good. As much as I want to like the food here I can't exactly say it was good and I'd come back again and again. Although I did have some left overs which tasted better the next day?! Kind of funny I thought. I will give them a few months to work out the kinks and hopefully the food comes out better. I for sure will order the wings since wings are always better than boneless anyway. On the plus side service is good as other Yelpers mentioned."
0,"I used to love this bakery for years for their crepes.  \n\nRecently I have visited the bakery twice in the past 5 weeks and it was terrible.  \n\nThe first visit a few weeks ago I ordered crepes and 45 minutes later they still never showed up at my table.  I asked for my money back as I couldn't wait any longer.\n\nThe second visit was today, and I thought I'd try again as some times you just have a bad day.  So I ordered the crepes again...well the service was much faster but when the crepes showed up the Creme Fraiche was melted and the crepes were swimming in the orange marmalade sauce (as I ordered the Crepe's Suzette).  It really did look like soup.  \nThe dish looked so unappetizing that I went back to the counter for a refund.  The dish was not acceptable and just didn't look good at all.\n\nI don't know what is going on with this bakery but it sure seems like they have management issues which is causing them to loose customers as I won't be back for a 3rd bad experience."
2,"The new ownership of Namaste, improved Health Department standard as well as stellar reviews and recommendations made me suggest this as the place for a co-worker's birthday lunch. I shared the Yelp link with all and we were waiting with anticipation to partake in a bevy of curries and mop that up with Naan.\n\nNamaste is really well done up. Dark wood paneling, soft muted lighting, cosy booths...I can see how this place could be the setting for quite the romantic date night (although Indian food may not be something you want to be eating on the first few dates!). Melque (?) the owner was very very personable. She checked up on us multiple times and sang a song (\""Ungforgettable\"") during lunch. Yes, it was a little strange and hard to talk to my table but she did have a good voice and she's just so sweet. \n\nNow the food...I only ate vegetarian since...I am vegetarian...a fairly extensive selection at Namaste so that was really nice. There were the usual salads and chutneys all of which were very fresh. The Navaratan Korma (mixed vegetable curry) was really really good, the soft basmati rice with peas also very comforting and the dal makhani was creamy and tasty. I wasn't a fan of the Uthapam and Sambar. The Uthapam was too sour (I guess the batter fermented a little too long) and I'm reiterating my usual complaint that no restaurant knows what Sambar is in Las Vegas. The Aloo Gobi and Spinach and Potato Puree were passable.We got a basket of Garlic Naans that was tasty but rather tough and dry. \n\nMy co-workers enjoyed the carnivorous fare but everyone asked me the same thing when we left...\""When are we going to Mount Everest again?\""\n\nI'll definitely be back as Namaste is one of the better buffets in town and the service and ambiance is really top notch."
3,"Great food and service, love the location. \nThis place is almost always busy, though sometimes I can get in there mid to late afternoon during a slow-down. \n\nI often get the iced tea and try a baked good.  The bakery items vary from day to day.  I've tried cornbread, cookies, and an apple tart - all very delicious.  \n\nYou can purchase coffee beans here too.   \n\nThere's free wifi, plenty of tables and rows of seats for us loners who like to just sit, sip, snack and work on the laptop."
4,"So so glad yelp reminded me about this place.  Its really a farm grill, on a farm and so fun to eat at.  I like to walk around the place after I'm done eating ribs and waffles for that old time feel.  Quaint, charming, and good eats nothing to complain about here."
0,"So displeased! I was really looking forward to trying them out, menu looked good and they profess to have such high quality and yet I found trash in my food as I was nearly halfway done eating it. I asked to speak with the manager and they tried to pawn me off on a training shift supervisor who went in back to speak with the actual manager and came back to try to tell me the piece of rubber I found in the bbq pork was a tendon. I re-requested to speak with the manager and she was completely apathetic and said I could talk to the owner. The owner's answer was and I quote \""I eat this all the time and have never gotten sick.\"" They said, \""It comes to us premade.\"" Really?!?! Never made any suggestion that he would check the batch for more debris or that he would make the distributor aware there was a problem. They just went on serving it. It was when I said he can't serve this crap to people he told me to leave. I shiver in disgust! Worst quality and customer service I've ever seen."
4,I've been taking my babies (boxers) to K-9 Kountry since January and they absolutely enjoy it! I love it! Andrea and George love and care for them as if they were their own. I wouldn't take them anywhere else. Thank you K-9 Kountry for going above and beyond...Providing a great service for our furry paw babies!
4,"Bryan is very knowledgeable, very efficient, very helpful and very focused on fixing the problem!!  My AC guy repaired a wire that had melted in my AC unit, but when it was turned on, the circuit breaker tripped.  The AC guy didn't know what else to do to fix it, because it was running within specs.  I called Bryan, based on Yelp reviews, and he did everything he could to help me diagnose and fix the problem over the phone - he was truly trying to save me the cost of a service call.  He had to come anyway and found that it was a very simple problem that was easy to fix, but the AC guy just didn't see it.  Will definitely use Bryan again!!!  Really, really nice guy who gets the meaning of customer service!"
1,"I'm not going to lie.  I was kind of excited that Lucky Strike was opening up downtown.  It's close to home, and downtown definitely needed something like this.  \nOur server was nice, but it probably took like...20 minutes to get a drink.  It was a Wednesday night, with probably 5 other people in there.  It's not like it was busy or anything.  When I finally got my drink, it was sooo watered down.  \nThen, when we ordered food.  Another 20 minutes later, the food runner comes out with our food, puts it at the wrong lane and when I asked him to bring it over to our table because it was ours, he gave me attitude.  I wasn't even being rude about it.  Anyways, I asked him for a side of ranch and some water, and he says, \""ask your server\"".  haha.  \nI work in the service industry.  So believe me, I'm not some stuck up, up tight, high maintenance customer.  I give great customer service, and when I'm paying pretty high prices for food and drinks, I expect pretty good service.  \nBasically, I'd rather go to a regular bowling ally during Cosmic Bowling where I can listen to better music, get a pitcher of beer and some good food for half the price."
1,"I came here last night with my rents to celebrate my mom's birthday, and it was a disappointing experience overall! The view and service both get 5 stars, but the food was mediocre at best.  \n\nWe started with two apps:  the Calamari & the Mussels (Limoncello style).  Both were \""eh\"".  The Calamari was soggy and greasy, BUT the dipping sauces that accompanied the dish were tasty.  The mussels were ok - the flavor itself was actually unique and interesting, but the portion size was weak.  Huge shells with tiny morsels of meat inside *sad face*\n\nAlthough our apps were weak, we had high hopes for our entrees.  I was stoked to get my Monterey style Cod (with artichoke hearts, tomato, garlic, green onion and muschrooms, sauteed in a Marsale wine sauce).  \n\nMy dish was a serious mess.  There was absolutely no flavor, and my fish was severely overcooked.  I was pretty unhappy (understatement of the day).  I had to douse my food in tabasco to fork it down.  Sad times all around.\n\nMy parents ordered stuffed Scallops and crabcakes, and although their dishes were much better than mine, they weren't particularly impressed either.  \n\nMonterey Bay's supposed to be a legit seafood restaurant, but the only good food I had was the French Onion Soup and bread (which were both awesome).  I wish I could give this place a better rating because the waitstaff was amazing and the view was spectacular, but the food just wasn't up to par."
1,"I stay at the Courtyard wherever I can, because I like the simplicity and the consistency. I have stayed at this property 4 times now, on business. Each stay is from Monday through Thursday.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by the general appearance and cleanliness of this Courtyard, compared to the outside (Southern - always under construction). The staff was helpful. Everything else is like a Courtyard and predictable. The real courtyard inside the hotel is wonderful; has sitting areas, a pool and nice walkway.\n\nI miss free coffee that I usually get at other Courtyards, but that is not a big deal for me.\n\nI was completely surprised and annoyed today when I received my email invoice (2 days after checking out). They added a $3.50 bottle water charge to my bill, which I did not take! $3.50 is not a lot of money, but I have lost trust in their billing system. I called to get the charge removed, but I would now have to check every bill and my credit card charges AFTER leaving the hotel. This has happened to me at other Marriott properties and I am questioning the value and pride in my Platinum status.\n\nPlease don't ever do this again to your guests."
0,"We must have had one of the most miserable bartenders EVER! This girl didn't smile once. She was absolutely inattentive, and bordering on rude. She clearly wasn't thrilled to be working the back bar on a Saturday night. Not in the least.\n\nOkay. So we arrive at about 8:30-ish and the bar is pretty crowded. There is much more seating than I ever remembered there being. I mean, I remember the old days when the majority of the place was a dance floor, I remember the transition to sports bar and the addition of VLTs, and I even remember then adding several bars to they could add more VLTs. I think the last time I was here was about 5 years ago and again, it has kind of changed. It has more of that old Peel Pub vibe then ever, only there are machines everywhere and it is no where near as classy! \n\nAnyhow, we and head to the back bar to wait for some friends to arrive. Seated right beside the bathrooms, it was the only empty bar. We soon learned why.\n\nWe had wanted to sit and have a few drinks, wait for our friends, but the drinking part wasn't going to happen anytime soon. Our bartender, who's bar is completely empty at this point, is kind of pacing back and forth, doing... I don't know what.\n\nFinally, after close to 15 minutes I gesture for drinks. She comes over and I ask what drinks are available, She tells me Labatt products - that's it. Okay. I get a beer and immediately am asked to pay for it. Okay. I offer my credit card but she says they only take cash. Whatever. Fine. The beer is cheap, I think it was $3.75, I mean, that's pretty cheap, but then again, it is cheap beer.\n\nLater on in the evening, I see someone drinking a Guinness. A Guinness?! Where'd he get that Guinness? From the bar. Maybe my bartender didn't have Guinness stocked, I ask her and she tells me she has Guinness, but I didn't ask for a Guinness. Okay.\n\nSo there you have it. Pub PJ is a dive. If you want to watch a live event like soccor or boxing, something like that, it makes sense, but I can see no other reason to head to that bar otherwise. We had a super rude and miserable bartender, oh and I forgot to mention that they do not have ANY hot water in the bathrooms. Only cold waters from their taps. According to one girl who works there she said this is how they cut corners. So I would hate to imagine the other areas they cut corners on.\n\nThanks but no thanks."
2,"It's good reliable food. Just not very generous on their ingredients. The overall portion sizes are good but the ingredients on their salads and pizza's leave something to be desired every time. Good flavors and a great eating environment. Good for studying or reading as well. I'd consider this more of a \""coffee shop\"" style place with good food and if you compare it to a cafe instead of a restaurant it's a 4 stars, but it just doesn't quite fit the cafe description so I must leave it at 3.5"
4,"Did an outstanding job on refinishing a set of OZ Superleggera's that had been neglected. The finish looks great and the machine cut faces really compliment the dark gray powder coat. They had already coated a turbo outlet piece for me with the same outstanding results. The only complaint I have is timely correspondence when things are complete. Had to call a few times to find out if things were done, but this is minor considering the work that was done. Will definitely use them again!"
2,"I like Culvers when it comes to fast food. They have a good selection even on the healthy side. Custard is fantastic of course, and I'm addicted to cheese curds."

0,"Will never buy a Infiniti again based on the experience with this dealship. I purchased my truck in April and the finance manager understood that the truck was to be registered in Michigan they gave me 90 day tag. I waited a month and called the dealership to find out what happened, come to find out that he registered the truck in Arizona, So I called the main Infiniti financial corporate offices and they said that they will fix the mistake and send the stuff over to Michigan. Again I called the state of Michigan and they said they never received anything. So once again I had to call the corporate office, they said they sent the original title and they would have to order a new one for AZ DMV. Well my tag expired so I went to the Dealership on camelback and after waiting 2 hours after they told me to be there for there finance manager to get there. He was able to print me out a 30 day tag. At that time I was parked in the service entrance and asked about the weather stripping on the roof racks, the guy that came out from service said he has seen this happen before and he needed to order new roof racks and when they came in they would need to be painted to match the truck. He took all my information and said he would call me when they came in. Its now 2 months since then, I have called service 4 times to get an update each time they could not find the order nor could they even find the VIN and asked me if I was calling the correct place and there's no way that I purchased the truck there. I have left messages with the sales manager RICK, the service manager BILL and talked with the salesman Brent who said he would look into it. \n\nALSO with not having the weather stripping the inside of the truck has water spots form the rain and car washes."
4,"Believe it or not, my friends and I got a recommendation for Mon Ami Gabi from our cab driver! On our cab ride from the airport to the hotel, the cab driver was giving us a song and dance about being able to get us into the clubs, so while he was on a roll, my friend asked him where he would recommend to eat. It was interesting to hear what he said even though we had all been to Vegas before.\n\nAm I glad we listened to him! He told us to check out Mon Ami Gabi around 2:30pm for lunch in order to catch the 3pm fountain show at the Bellagio. We went on Sunday around 2:15pm and asked for a table outside on the rail (like the cabbie told us to ask for). They told us it would be a 45 minute wait especially for a table outside. But it turned into more like 30 minutes. We killed time at the casino ; ) \n\nEverything was perfect, except that is was SOOOO sunny and hot on this particular day, so we ended up rushing through our meal due to the fact that the seats \""on the rail\"" have to cover above. Even with that, the service was perfect, the waitress was polite and fast and the food...was AMAZING. Two of us got the same sandwich special and my other friend got one of the club sandwiches. We all liked our food. Yum! The sandwich I had was chicken with pesto, grilled red peppers and yummy cheezy-ness! YUM!\n\nThe lunch prices were surprisingly reasonable for such good service and food, $9-$15! Seeing (and hearing) the Bellagio water show was so fun!\n\nMy recommendation is:\n1) During the day, ask to sit outside, but under and umbrella!\nOr\n2) Go for a super late lunch or early dinner when the sun is lower in the sky or dark : ) It must be beautiful then!\n\nHighly recommend it, but if you need a very specific time, call ahead and make a reservation so you get to see the show! Check out times here:\n\nMonday - Friday\n3:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1/2 hour\n8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes\n\nSaturdays, Sundays and Holidays\n12:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1/2 hour\n8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes"

0,I've owned my house in their delivery area for 5 years I've ordered from them at least once a month for 3 years they still call me telling me they are confirming my first time order every time. When I've went in the employees where making Mormon Jokes right in front of me and I happen to be Mormon. They never deliver on time and the place when I've gone in is very dirty and the food handlers I've seen touch their face then the pizza. I only still order from here because there aren't many options in this area. Worst Pizzahut I've ever encountered.
3,"= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\n\nSo Copper Kettle in Mesa closed, following Copper Kettle in Tempe.  (Same family, different reasons).\n\nThe good news is that they have sprung back to life over here in the former home of Indus Village.  Like Indus, this restaurant is Pakistani, not Indian.  Much of the food is similar but they serve beef here & don't serve alcohol.  They have a Lunch Buffet, as they did at the other locations, & there's also a regular menu.*\n\nArlin B. joined me today to give it a try.  Formerly \""Grumpy Uncle\"" from the Mesa location runs this new place, but he was totally friendly & nice today.  The food was excellent too, & he has gotten rid of most of those garish chairs that were hard to get in & out of when it was Indus.\n\nWhat you'll get here is different, tasty food, with significant overlap in dishes to an Indian Buffet since, after all, Pakistan used to be part of India.  It's just different enough to make it special, so come help this new Copper Kettle get off to a good start!     :-))\n\n* Lunch Buffet ($8.04) is served weekdays from 11 to 3.  They also offer a Dinner Buffet, with fancier food, from 5 to 9:30 PM on Friday, Saturday & Sunday."
4,"I love sushi, more specifically dragon and chubby rolls. They're great. Sushi Mon used to be my favorite AYCE; Goyemon has superseded it for one reason and one reason only. Pork belly. I have no idea what sauce they put on that pork but it's perfect. The same great sushi, with a side of tempura ice cream, and now with pork belly. Sweet."
1,"Recently stopped in for the first time in a long time.\n\nService still sucks and so does the food menu.\n\nGuess if you're not the bottle service crowd they don't have much of an interest in you.\n\nThey also stopped giving the free drink with movie ticket.\n\nOh, and the prices for everything went up.  \n\nNothing like bad food, bad service, AND premium prices.\n\nIf you're looking to have a meal go to one of the other restaurants.  Even Ranch House is better."
1,"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\"" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone."
3,"I've had New Orleans Take-Out, as take-out, a few times now for lunch.\n\nI was inspired to visit by a Madison.com article highlighting the \""best\"" sandwiches in Madison, and the oyster po' boy here made the list.\n\nI did not have the chance to try this sandwich however, I was steered away by their sampler meal, to Mardi Gras combo. This included their jambalaya, red beans and rice and shrimp creole.\n\nThe red beans and rice was simple, delicately seasoned and made well, as it should be.\n\nThe jambalaya was loaded with sausage, the holy trinity and the like and seasoned very nicely. It was lukewarm however, somewhat of a turnoff seeing as how I ate it a few minutes after receiving my order.\n\nIn stark contrast, the shrimp creole blew me away with it's heat, both temperature wise and spiciness!  I love spicy hot, and this is not your typical \""American spicy\"", it had me sweating good! It was also absolutely delicious, the shrimp also had a bite to it. Many make the mistake of overcooking shrimp, not so here. This became my go-to dish on my return visits.\n\nOn a later visit I also tried the crawfish po' boy, which was quite tasty. I realize crawfish can be expensive especially this far from the coast, but for $10.95 I felt there could have been a bit more meat. The sandwich was somewhat bread heavy, perhaps this is the best they can do with the cost of the crustaceans, I don't know.\n\nAlso in true New Orleans style, all the meals I've had came with a piece of cornbread, a nice addition to the ensemble.\n\nAll in all a good experience in a cuisine that is tragically unrepresented in the Madison area, definitely have the shrimp creole if you can handle the heat!"
4,"Best seafood in the city! Love it here! I haven't had anything that has been bad from here. My husband and I have been here quite a few times. Last time we had the fisherman's platter and rib-eye steak. Both were fantastic! The fried scallops and fried shrimp were amazing with the dipping sauce they give. The only thing that irritated me was the fact the waiter wasn't paying attention to our drinks. I like for a waiter to notice when I finish my drink so I can get another one. I guess it was a busy night so he was running around. However, he gave us two free desserts at the end. One was chocolate cake and the other was the key lime pie. The chocolate fudge cake was a bit too rich for me but the key lime pie was AMAZING! This is definitely a place to visit when you are in Vegas!"
4,"Told in a way that only Cirque du Soleil can, O is an amazing show of gymnastics, acrobatics, contortionists, synchronized swimming, and diving.  You can't help but truly appreciate what the human form can do and you might even be inspired to hit the gym or try a yoga class (just be sure not to hurt yourself trying to re-enact something you see at the show).  And in addition to the amazing performers, you'll also be amazed at the engineering marvel that is the stage.  A huge swimming pool with a sectioned floor that can rise and submerge while keeping virtually all of the water in the tank???  Fantastic!\n\nThe only other thing I can say is that even though the front row seats cost more, they aren't, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  Because there is so much going on in the show, I would actually recommend seats further back so that you can see everything going on on stage.  \n\nA must see if you're in Vegas!"
1,"I'm not sure if it's this location, it's management or just the fact that the food really sucks but it's gone from a really good place to meet and eat to about the last place you want to choose unless you're really desperate. \n\nFirst off for a place that features 3 main menu items, Wings, Pizza and Calzones, all of them are horrible! \n\nThe wings are small, not breaded, usually have a bit of an aftertaste from old grease and for some reason you wait for 20 minutes for an order, these should be ready to go at all times! It's a staple on the menu! I always order my wings plain with sauce on the side, all their sauces seem to have broken down and are now pretty much just a layer of butter with color... not very appetizing at all!\n\nOn to the pizza, for some reason always burnt! I've ordered it on 3 different occasions and finally gave up after giving them the benefit of the doubt, thin crust, almost paper thin, an OK sauce but when you can order it and say, I'd rather have gone to Pizza Hut you know there is a problem.\n\nNow the Calzones, totally in the other direction, these on 3 occasions have in each event been fully undercooked! It's as if the kitchen doesn't understand how to time orders so they put everything in at the same time and take it all out at the same time, sadly this doesn't work! Pizza and Calzone have different cooking times!!! They don't understand that and I've given up on the place. \n\nMy last visit there was for Monday Night Football and for a sports themed bar, they had 7 customers in the entire place and 2 were off duty employee's! To me if you can't get people in your place on Monday Night Football with a menu and bar geared to that crowd, you need to revamp and rethink what you're doing because it's not working! \n\nMy last outing there, several customers were talking about going Buffalo Wild Wings now that it reopened, Native made it too easy for people to make that decision! \n\nSorry guys call me when you figure it out!"
0,"I have been here quite a few times since they opened.  A couple of those times were corporate events (*****) and a couple were just regular visitation (***).  During the corporate events, everything was great but largely due to the budget of the hosting company.  On the other times the service has not been great in the outdoor bar area, but that is another review for another day (many people were billed twice near the outdoor bar and servers think Cabernet Sauvignon is a white wine).  \n\nDo not book a \""social event\"" and actually be a popular person or run into people you know at the venue.  Also, do not speak positively about this venue on social media while you are there as \""social event\"" means \""private event\"" to TopGolf and you will be charged for people who are near you, even if you do not know them all... The contracted amount of people are the maximum allowed near your unsecured area despite a fixed cost but increased revenue on the part of TopGolf (patrons will pay 18% gratuity for being near you).  Just have someone arrive early and reserve a couple of lanes and wait the 2 hours, $1,000 will go a lot further that way.\n\nWe moved everyone we knew to the bar area in lieu of breaking up the group but they chose to pack up our food an hour early without checking with me, regardless of the fact that we paid for a fixed amount of time.\n\nI am certain this company is trying to alter the definition of customer service as they do not seem to understand it.  Constant defense of a poorly written \""contract\"" and management continually blaming their employees for a flawed policy is not service.\n\nAlso, Joe B., do not respond to this post with some useless apology, you can feel free to contact me directly as the staff has my contact information.  If you do not plan to address this issue, spare us the commentary."
4,"We had the most wonderful shopping experience at Southwestern Reflections!\nIt was the perfect spot to buy keepsakes for each of our children and that special little something for all of our family members back home!  We bought THE MOST BEAUTIFUL blanket for my son! And, he enjoys it every night...\n\nWe bought backscratchers, t-shirts, pot holders (that we use everyday), great signs...jewelry, specialty lotion made in Arizona and so much more! It was a one stop shop and we are so grateful we found it! Thanks Southwestern Reflections... see you next time!!!!"
2,"I've been to Eddies a number of times over the years, and consistently forget to write about them - or even that I've been. I'm not sure if that means that they are not memorable or that they have just become so ingrained in my mind that I forget. Whatever the case, time to rectify the situation.\n\nThe good: Open for breakfast, and they serve up some interesting options, which means you may actually have to look at the menu to figure out what you want. Unfortunately this also means that they can get busy at breakfast, so you can have to wait.\n\nThe bad: The service can get a bit slow at times, though you can mitigate that a bit by going at a slightly off-time rather than a popular dining time. Unfortunately it only happens sometimes - at other times, it seems that the off hours dining is when the servers take their breaks, so it hits you too. On the plus side, it can make for a relaxing meal, and the food itself is generally tasty."
2,great drinks. Good prices. BUT YOUR HOURS MAKE ME WANT TO DESTROY YOU.
3,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! We ordered and got our food within 15 minutes! Great atmosphere. Located in Downtown Las Vegas - I highly recommend this restaurant! Clean, inexpensive and great quality food! They even had live music//band playing! Margaritas were also to die for! I had the cheese enchiladas and my boyfriend had the chicken tacos! His exact words \""These are the best tacos I have ever had!\"""
0,Find some where else to sit and eat prior to your flight. I have tried it twice thinking maybe their lunch would be better than their breakfast but it was all terrible
4,"The longhorn burger was great, and the shoestring fries were nice and crispy. Best part of the meal was the shake, Had the oreo shake which was great."
1,"I have tried the majority of chinese restaurants in Montreal, and as a taiwanese born, i have to say that my family of 6 did not enjoy the food here for it being overly heavy on salt and spices. We ordered water boiled fish, cumin beef, pickled vegetable chicken, seaweed, garlic pork and EVERYTHING was way too spicy despite asking for mild spices. The service is acceptable as in most chinese places, but poor by caucasian standard. Needless to say i will not be going back."
3,"I haven't been to Blue Fin in a couple of years.  The last time I went, I LOVED it...I thought it was better than my go to sushi place.\n\nI went last night with some friends, and had a good experience.  Not spectacular, but pretty good.\n\nThe restaurant itself, is beautiful.  They've expanded since the last time I was in, and they now have a very large, spacious dining room, that is separate from the sushi bar area.  There are still tables near the bar, which is where we sat. \n\nWe had a couple of servers taking care of us, and they were all polite, and very helpful.  \n\nThe prices for drinks are pretty good.  I had an iced green tea for $2.50 with free refills, and a small bottle of hot sake for $3.95.  My roommate had a LARGE bottle of beer for $6.95.  Not bad at all.  I could have had a large hot sake for only $2 more, but...I was trying to behave myself. ;)\n\nNow...the fish!\nMy favorite specialty roll here, is the Royal Unagi (made without avocado).  Its a baked roll with eel, cream cheese, a bit of tempura, and eel sauce on top.  It was just as delicious as I remembered, only...SO rich!!I really really wish that they would do a half roll, but on the baked/deep fried rolls, they don't do halves.\n\nThe quality of the nigiri was good...not as consistantly good as Sushi Mon's but it was decent. My favorites of the night were:\nThe Spicy Garlic Tuna...for a girl who is NOT a fan of spicy, this was too much for me to have more than a piece of.  So why did I go back for thirds?  SO delicious...the flavor was incredible.  So incredible, that I didn't care how badly my mouth was on fire.  \nThe Unagi:  Perfect EVERY time.\nThe Ebi:  Really good...perfect texture.\n\nFrom the appetizer menu, I LOVED the gyoza.  these were delicious!!  I'm a big gyoza fan, and really enjoyed these.\n\nEverything else we tried  was good, but didn't blow me away. Super White, which is my absolute favorite was GREAT the first round, but the second round was \""meh.\""\nAlso, the rice fell apart quite a lot at the beginning of the meal.\n\nI will say this, though, the service was great.  We sent two dishes back, and the only questions asked were simply quality control. \nOne we sent back because it had a ton of creamy \""yum yum\"" sauce, which is not mentioned on the menu...if it was, we wouldn't have ordered it (my friend has a texture thing with creamy sauces...and I didn't care for the texture.)  \nThe other we sent back, because my friend is pregnant, and the baby said \""NOPE!\"" (Don't worry, her doctor said it was fine as long as the fish is cooked, and we triple checked everything with the servers.)\n\nAll in all, pretty good experience.  I've had better at Sushi Mon, but I would definitely come back here again."
0,"Worst hotel ever! I swear to god first night I check in no hot water and the telephone wasn't working and then they tell me that they are working on getting the water fixed and that was at 9pm and then by twelve noon the next day I still couldn't take a shower then they where acting like they couldn't switch my room and told me to walk to another room to go take a shower ! Then they tell me my room isn't the same as that room so they couldn't switch me and then I go to take my shower ITS THE EXACT SAME ROOM! So I go back to the front desk and demand them to switch my rooms and then the next day I pay cash and they charge my credit card when they already charged the room and security deposit when I checked in the hotels not even fascinating to have a security deposit they don't even have wide screen tvs the lightning in the rooms suck big time and their check out is at 11 in the morning. Then I fount bugs in my room and the front desk \""manager\"" called himself saying I was lying like who really lies about bugs !! Awful awful I've stayed at plenty quality inns and this is the WORSE not worth it I don't recommend unless your a person who doesn't care about yourself hygiene or safety awful !"
1,"We will NEVER be back. I'm only giving it two stars cause our server was wonderful, but without good food, the service doesn't mean too much.\n\nMy man ordered the chicken crepe. Sounds good in theory, until it came out, and it looked like a soupy mess! So much flavorless liquid, it was totally disgusting. Whatever liquid (think like chicken pot pie soup, but without any flavor) made the crepe slimy and gooey, and not appetizing. \n\nI ordered corned beef hash, and it was too salty, tasted un-cooked and really chewy. It resembled dog food/asphalt. \n\nBoth of our came with their \""famous\"" potato pancakes, and I think they should be \""famous\"" for being horrible. No flavor, and VERY greasy!! Needed salt, or ketchup to make them edible. It came with a little cup of apple sauce, which happened to be the most flavorful item we received. Too bad it was supposed to be a condiment. \n\nSeriously, we have NEVER had such a horrible breakfast in Las Vegas. Please save yourself some money and go somewhere else!!"
1,"I booked Le Westin given the great reviews, I'm a gold SPG member and it had a great location. I booked three nights with a discounted prepaid rate. However, due to weather challenges in Chicago (12 hours at the airport on a Thursday and an offer to not get to Montreal until later on Friday) I ended up cancelling the trip. I did both call SPG and the hotel directly alerting them of the issue and they deferred me to the hotel's \""billing group\"" and promised they would email the team of my problems. I didn't expect they would refund all three nights but I was asking for a reasonable accommodation. Since I didn't have a call by Monday I called SPG directly and they told me they could not assist and, once again, had me call the hotel. When I did speak with a hotel representative they told me that the \""billing group\"" had nothing to do with the decision and took my information for a manager to contact me. Well, I did see one attempted call from the hotel with no message. I haven't attempted to call back as I assume their position is they have no interest in my issue or care about my business.\n\nOn a positive note, I did work with their concierge prior to the trip on arranged transportation to the hotel. Given the evolving departure times I was in regular email contact with the concierge team and they were incredibly helpful in keeping the car service aware of the issue. When the plane was cancelled they immediately contacted me and wanted to confirm my plans. Once I connected with them they were sympathetic to my travel challenges and ensured that I was not responsible to may for the car service since I was proactively communicating with them. I did let them know that they had earned my business purely through email - I just wish the hotel's management had a similar concept of hospitality."
3,"= = = = = =  MUCH IMPROVED!  = = = = = =\n\nYay, saw a big improvement here today over the last time I visited this Old Country a while back!  I stopped in for lunch today, arriving just before 11 AM to enjoy the lower Breakfast Buffet price.  The staff  members were cheerful, the place was roaring busy, and there was PLENTY TO EAT, with 123 main food items out, plus sauces and dressings.  There was good Menudo, creamy Cottage Cheese, and little skillets such as we see on the Vegas Strip.  One set contained \""Steak Tips & Loaded Mashed Potatoes,\"" and another \""Pulled Pork & Cowboy Potatoes.\""  At the grill area beef roast, turkey and ham were being sliced & served to order. \n\nEverything I ate was fresh and tasty, served at the right temperature and the trays were kept properly stocked.  The table service was excellent, and the Manager even circulated around to each table to say \""Hi\"" and make sure everyone was happy.\n\nLots of different tasty desserts were on hand to finish up with, and the whole feast measured up close to the excellent Golden Corral Buffet down the street.\n\nIt's a HIGH 4 STARS this time for this Old Country Buffet, where the fare was just $7.49/$6.99 Sr. entering before 11 AM or $8.49/$7.99 after...  an excellent value at either price.     :-))"
4,"We didn't expect to come here to eat tonight, but our planned outing to RigaTony's went bust due to a 30+ minute wait for a table.  Still in the Italian mood, we were headed for VinciTorio's when we saw Fusion.  Mediterranean food?  Sure!\n\nThe meal opened with excellent service and about the freshest falafel I've ever had.  There's a comforting feeling about the place--it's family-run.  The owner's young daughter walks around the floor of the restaurant (no bother at all) and came up to our table and smiled at us while the waiter took our order.\n\nThe beef kabobs were. . .sublime.  Tasty cubes of meat on ghee-coated basmati rice.  In some places beef juices soaked a bit into the rice making it even more incredible. Even better, the salad was ROMAINE lettuce, not iceberg.  Quality.   My wife had the beef gyro with a rice noodle and lentil dish that was the Mediterranean version of mac & cheese.  My daughter had a falafel gyro.\n\nDessert?  Yes.  I have never had a baklava with a taste this complex before.  Huge pieces of pistachio nuts blended their flavor with dough, honey, and spices to make a pastry that was not too sweet, but just perfect in taste and texture.\n\nMy wife and I agree that this is the best Mediterranean food place we have been to in the Valley--by far.  The owner also tells us that he is going to be introducing more seafood and Caribbean cuisine to his menu soon.  Talk about fusion.   I'm game.  We are going to be visiting this place again in the near future!"
2,"It was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. We took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes sea bass with Peruvian corn and Yellowtail Taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. The Peruvian corn was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the sea bass. We let the server know and he brought out some Purple Potato Mash just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nThe service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. We enjoyed 4 different sakes, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nIf you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\nTypical price for food in LV... $$$... although I didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\nGood Brazilian/Peruvian fusion... but if I had a choice between this and traditional sushi... obviously traditional."
0,"On the upside, they have a lot of equipment, services, and classes. They offer it at a great price and the hours are convenient, however for working 3rd shift the classes I would want to do aren't offered early enough for me.\n\nDownside was offered a free hour of personal training when I signed up. Once the personal trainer found out I had no plans to continue personal training, they had no interest in me and were very dismissive.\n\nThe BIG Downside and reason I'll never go there again. The only payment they accept is automatic withdrawals from my checking account/credit card. Was going out of state for a few months and wanted to cancel my membership. Went in and they refused to cancel it there... even though I signed up there. They stated I had to fill out a form and send it to the California office. Sent it out and was still getting charged. Repeated the process. Still got charged. After the third time and me STILL getting charged, closed my checking account against them. \nThen they had the nerve to threaten to send me to a collection agency for not paying the bill. I stated they could go ahead, I'd be happy to take it to court and get my money back for the months of them billing me after I initially tried closing the account. Found out later, LA Fitness has a policy that anyone who tried to close the account and doesn't send it certified mail, they just throw the letters away. I know they've had a few class action lawsuits against them, and can't remember if this was one of them."
0,"Unless you like being ignored, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty. There was a lady waiting at the counter for her order, two gentlemen who already had their order and were seated and eating. There was one worker for the front counter and the drive thru and 2 or 3 workers in the back. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to take my order and wasn't even acknowledged in that time. One of the guys came up front to bag drive thru orders, wiped the sweat off his face with a napkin, crumpled it up, tossed it in the trash and then scooped up fries without washing his hands. At that point I walked out and went to Culvers where I ordered and got my food in less time than I spent waiting to order here.  Not even worth one star!"
4,"Speaking of sandwiches, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had was at Capriotti's last year in Vegas.  It's an interesting establishment; It originated in Delaware but now Nevada has by far the most locations.\n\nNot sure if this was the one I went to, but I'm guessing the other locations are comparable.  It was kind of out of the way, away from the strip.  We took a cab there and didn't realize there was no ride back.  We ended up walking under the tremendous heat afterward but eventually found a taxi after walking several blocks.  Oh well, we had to try it because of the good things said about the place.\n\nSo we decided to share one of those super long subs.  We got the Capastrami because pastrami is the best meat on a sandwich (imo).  And....wow.  It was amazing.  The pastrami, coleslaw, and russian dressing of some sort made this sandwich so unique and so darn tasty.  It was just pure bliss.\n\nI have to go back, but alas there isn't a Capriotti's remotely closeby.  Anyone up for a road trip to Vegas?  Or Ahwatukee, Arizona perhaps?"
0,"I eat at Chipotle almost every day and usually visit the location by the Scottsdale Quarter and experience great service. This location however has poor service and they had their staff using their left hands to scoop smaller portion sizes, really?? They give you like 5 small cubes of meat and tiny portions of beans etc... This is not good service..  They need to step up to the plate and give service that is expected at a Chipotle franchise. Needless to say I will never visit this location again. By the way everyone that has experienced the same service there is relief close by at Grayhawk with another Chipotle location."
3,"I've been hitting up Wild Wing in the EpiCentre for a long time now - bout time I wrote a review for it! About a year ago the place closed down for a bit and went through an overhaul and corporate bought the place up. I, for one, have never had a bad experience here either way... before or after corporate had bought it. \n\nThe food is tasty but you need to know what to order. Some items, like the queso and the buffalo dip, are a bit lackluster, nothing great and I'd say save the money and just get something else. I love the little pups here... they are mini hot dogs with chili on them. Simple enough but the chili has a little spice kick (not hot spice but flavorful). And I tend to get the buffalo chicken salad quite often. The salad is huge and will definitely fill you up. The wings give you plenty of options with over 30 flavors - most of the flavors seemed baked on or maybe rubbed on, but if you are expecting hot wings dripping in sauce, you won't get them here. \n\nThe location is great, except for paying for parking but hey, that's Uptown's thing, not Wild Wing... plus the light rail runs right behind it so you can always jump on that. Live music on the weekends which makes for great energy in the bar. And a good drink selection, plenty of taps and always a drink on special. I don't make Wild Wing my usual jaunt but if I'm around Trade St, I have no problems stopping in for a bite or sip."
3,"Stopped by for lunch,,, 1st lunch at this place and i have to say ,, The Teriyaki Shroomer was delicious !!! \n\nA tad greasy at the begining, but awesome flavor,,, def a goto lunch spot ,,,, \n\nThanks again to the staff there,, !!! great job.."
4,"It's Panda. Not as fresh food, they cook more when it runs out, but it meets my expectations so they get 5 stars.\n\nFill out the survey on the back of the receipt to get a free item on your next visit.\n\nI bought the $25 gift cards around Christmas time and got the free 2 item meal. nice deal for sure."
4,"Before coming here, I had never had Pho before, but I definitely loved everything I consumed there. To be honest, I don't really know what I ate there because my friends always take the initiative to order for me. However, I've eaten something different every time, which leads me to believe that it'd be hard to find anything bad on the menu.\nAlso, the girl that works there most often, or at least the times I've been there, is super sweet and very helpful.  She answered all questions about the menu honestly, and was a little spunky.  The good service only added to the positive experience. I dig this place."
0,"My gf and I came in at about 8pm on a Friday night expecting a wait. As we were seated we wondered why it was so dead and soon realized! The wait staff was great but the food was barely above buffet quality. I had the rib sampler and was only able to eat it after I drenched in one of there \""spicy\"" habenero sauces. The Mac n cheese was on par with kfc. I would not recommend this place and will definitely be going to Jim n Nicks next time where I know the food is great."
1,"I used a groupon here and ordered the vegetarian platter. It was extremely bland and a bit gross. 1) I have never ordered a vegetarian platter without hummus (seriously, where was the hummus!) 2)The rice and fried spinach thing had no flavor 3)that platter would have cost me $10 \n\nI have one more groupon and will try something different, but I probably won't go back after that."
3,"First off, $28 for dinner. Ouch. But it's Vegas and I'm not much of a gambler so my money has to go SOMEWHERE, right?\n\nSo the line wasn't too bad when we got here at around 6 PM. I must say though I was impressed with how it took about 20 minutes to seat us when there were clearly open tables. Maybe to ensure we'd start off towards the food at a comfortable get-the-hell-out-of-my-way pace? If so, mission accomplished Cravings Buffet.\n\nThey had an Italian station, 2 Asian stations, a carving station, a Mexican food station, a salad station, and a desert section where there's a hidden gelato station at the far right corner past the desert bar; it's not self serve though so be prepared to bug someone to get you delicious strawberry gelato.\n\nI got 3 plates of food and finished about half of each because I was so overwhelmed. I got the prime rib which was delicious for being carved from a buffet station. It was medium rare and lovely and pink, very flavorful. The pastas were alright (al dente but the sauces were average) and the ceviche was just ok. Not enough citrus, in my opinion. The asian stations were more flavorful and the barbecue pork buns were nice and perfectly steamed. I strongly recommend getthing the chipotle mashed potatoes though.\n\n(Note: If you want the perfect plate, get a slice of prime rib, a side of chipotle mashed potatoes with turkey gravy, a made-to-order salad from the salad bar, and some corn bread. So. Good.)\n\nThe sushi station was measly and didn't even look good enough to try though. I've seen better looking sushi at Chinese buffets. \n\nOh, but the desert station! Little pies!! I'm a weirdo for mini versions of things, like some girls. They had mini Dutch Apple Pie, mini raspberry pie (filling had souffle consistency) mini pecan pie, and a mini peanut butter pie. They were all scrumptious and adorable! The passion fruit infused cake with orange and strawberry slices on top was both aesthetically pleasing and subtly sweet. The strawberry gelato was very, very bold flavored and the cookies and cream flavor was a miss. The chocolate one was probably the best.\n\nThe service was not that great. It shouldn't be a big deal for a buffet if the waiters are good or not but the tables were kind of small and the plates were huge so it was noticeable when we'd been unattended for half an hour and even the ice in my water is gone. Because I ate my ice cubes as a form of hydration. Bad bad baaaaaaad.\n\nThe setting was pretty nice, contemporary American theme going and the stations had their respective titles above them to keep from having lines and long wait times to get food. \n\nI would go again, if there were coupons or I'd try that tip to go for lunch prices but dinner items."
1,"So not worth the money. We ate in the \""formal\"" dining room and there was no charm or even real ambience. No decorations except a giant chandelier thing and glass wall. The waiter was snooty and kept trying to size us up...and he took forever. We were trying to get to a show and had to flag him down...twice. My cheese plate was mediocre and the spaghetti seafood didn't have any flavor. My veal carpaccio was the star of the meal (but still not the best I've ever had). And the drink prices? Outrageous! My prosecco was $14 a glass...and that is how much one bottle of the stuff costs at a liquor store. Definitely wouldn't come back here - there is too much cooler stuff in Vegas."
4,"Enjoyed a delicious, hot breakfast this morning at griddlecakes. Servers are very friendly, attentive to their tables and quick on their feet. \nFood came out hot and extremely fast, while maintaining it's flavor. Portion sizes are big and I guarantee you will leave happy, and with a full belly. \nI had the gluten free pancakes while Jordan enjoyed the meatlovers scramble. We both loved our meals. \nCannot wait to go back."
1,"We walked way too far down the strip in way too hot weather to experience this and Coca-Cola World. It was somewhat fun and entertaining, but not really worth the trek. I was hoping for cool flavors (they have PB&J m&ms at the store in NYC!) but the only original flavor was coconut.\n\n\nTIP: If you're a Bank of America customer, there is an ATM on the third floor. This was an unexpected bonus and probably the best part about going here (bad sign!)"
3,"This is one of the nicer Target stores in Las Vegas, lacks store services though as there is only a Pharmacy here. Overall, for a older Target Greatland, this store looks as if it just opened yesterday still. It is always super slow here too, so if you like to shop in peace, you've found your match!"
0,"It is seldom that I feel like I will never return to a restaurant under any circumstances and this is one of them.  The restaurant was expensive and the food was terrible.  The salsas were bordering on tasteless, the entr\u00e9es huge.  I had the regular chili rellenos.  They were swimming in a tasteless sauce, with very little chili taste.  I managed to get one of the huge rellenos down.  My side was refried beans.  They were good.  We took the remaining relleno home for my husband's lunch the next day.  He ate the beans but he also could not eat the Relleno, and it hit the garbage can.  I seldom write reviews but I feel that this is one that needs to be written.  Please read the other other reviews.  I found them to be true even down to the chip in the salsa bowl."
0,"Anyone who gives this more than 1 star is still drunk from the night before. EVERYTHING is pathetic. People think all you can eat is worth a good review? Please. Get some taste.\nThe waffles were either hard or soggy and tasteless. The bacon was a grease pile of fat, everything else is dried out or overcooked or tasteless. (La Quinta gives you fresher waffles for FREE with a $89 room.) Home fries were frozen patties, and pastries were stale and store bought, you can see the boxes!  Save the $25 per person and eat ANYWHERE else. Trust me on this one, there is NO reason to come here. Go to Red White and Blue or Raffles or just anywhere else... nothing was fresh or worth the wasted time here."
4,"There's always a line, but don't fret it moves really quickly. I always get the chicken chipotle avocado whether its for lunch or 3am. This place is open 24/7. It's about $7/per sandwich."
1,"Quick edit: thanks to manager Dave for looking to right this wrong with an apology and offer to chat about ways to improve the experience next time. I haven't returned but the attention to fixing is appreciated. \n\nYelp steered me wrong this time. This place was pretty mediocre. The atmosphere was great but the food was disappointing given then reviews and price. \n\nFirst, the chips are actually tortillas which a thick dash of what tastes like paprika. Not great and salsa was thin and just boring.\n\nI got the \""el Jefe\"" filet and shrimp taco and was really disappointed. The meat was very chewy and just thrown on with two small shrimp. A real letdown, especially given the price. My other item was the fish taco gobernador. I asked for items with no dairy and while the cheese was removed, the taco had a slew of Creme sauce on it hidden by lots of lettuce and a little piece of fish.\n\nFinally, my waiter was barely around. We didn't get silverware until someone got up to ask after asking when our meals were delivered and we had to find someone again to ask for the check once we were finished.\n\nNeedless to say, despite just one visit and taste testing a few items, I won't be back."
3,"Went to see adventure club perform at this night club and it was insane!! I like that there are multiple areas to get drinks. The space is small and on that specific night, it was super packed. I don't know if I would go here if it was a local dj spinning but I do keep an eye out for their special events. Tickets were only 15 a person. My recommendation for the company is to have a seperate line for folks who purchase tickets ahead of time."
1,"Conveniently located on the way in to the movie theater, my mom and I popped in here for a snack to smuggle in to the movie. Nothing makes my mom happier than a good bakery, but actually nothing here looked great to me. Perhaps it was the time of day?  I think we stopped in at about 7pm.\n\nI settled on a big chocolate chip cookie that was WAY too sweet.  Like, inedible.  \n\nMy mom loved her danish thing that she ate the next morning, though.  And service was very friendly."
2,"Make a Reservation first!! we had a 45mins. wait to get in G.R.Pub &Grill which is inside Caesars Palace, it seats about 300 people to me it is authentic and sorta of dark inside,there are all type of tables here tall,short,large round ones as well as small round ones,I saw about four flat screen TV on with no sound,all of the hostess had on dresses that look like newpaper printing from London on it,the server inside were all dress difference too dark pants,dark long sleeve shirt with a vest on that has zippers and chairs that was cool.We ordered fish &chips,english chips,rhubarb cobbler with two scoops of Ice cream,the food was OK nothing really that special,the server also bring a I-pad to your table for you to order wine and dessert on, Our experience here was not as good as expected slow yet friendly but improved as the meal progressed,the server was not that attentive to our needs.We are not in a hurry to get back here."
0,"A couple years ago, my BF treated me to a massage at Massage Envy, she had a coupon for a discount.  When we booked the appointment, I requested a female masseuse.  When we arrived, I was told I would have a male masseuse instead.  I take daily injections for a medical condition, and I happen to bruise very easily.  Prior to the massage, I had hit a vein and caused a dark bruise on my stomach.  I warned the masseuse about the bruise, but English was apparently not his first language.  When I flipped over, the masseuse saw the bruise and asked if my husband was abusive.  I then had to re-explain the bruise a couple of times before he understood.  Also, the masseuse was quite chatty which I don't care for at all.  Needless to say, this was not a relaxing massage at all, I would rate it as my all time worst massage."
2,"BLT Burger is located in the Mirage where my boyfriend and I were staying for our Vegas trip so we decided to check it out. \n\nAs with any place that has a Turkey Burger I decided to order that and my boyfriend got himself the Tex-Mex Burger with waffle fries. The Turkey Burger was delicious and from the boyfriend's review the Tex-Mex Burger tasted good but is a messy eater. Fries are just that, nothing special about them and they give you a small amount. \n\nThe reason this place gets 3 stars is because there was nothing impressive about the service and the prices (as everything is on the strip) were a tad expensive. For example for a side of fries it would set you back five dollars. \n\nGood turkey burger, pricey if you don't keep track of what you're ordering."
4,"This is my \""home\"" Starbucks store, located in the Upper Lobby of the U. S. Steel Tower.  Calling it the UPMC building will summon a wrath I'm sure you'd rather no experience.\n\nThe service is excellent, and the staff knows a good bit of their clientele by name which is impressive since this 52 floor building has a lot of coffee addicts.  On occasions that my syrups have tasted off, they've always remade my drink without asking questions.  And if they get the size wrong I always get the extra drink, which is a nice bonus ... as if I need any more caffeine.\n\nI have taken breaks from coffee in the past, be it for caffeine overloads or simply trying to save money ... but this particular location always welcomes me back with open arms."
0,"Unfortunately, you are limited to where you can dine at Terminal 2 in the Phoenix airport for breakfast.  Fast food or this steaming pile of dog poop.\n\nDirty... tables aren't wiped.  The servers clear food off the tables onto the floor using their hands.  Nice.\n\nExtremely limited breakfast menu.  Yes, they have eggs.  But only scrambled.  Paper plates and plasticware so thin make sure you get a few extra sets as the first set will surely break.\n\nSurlly, disheveled, and disgruntled employees.\n\nYou're better off down the hall at Round Table pizza for breakfast.  At least it's clean!"
1,"I want to start by saying, everyone was polite and in the end, they refunded my money. I'm assuming most of the other reviews are based on baked goods, unfortunately, all I can speak for is two soups and a croissant. Split pea was watery, flavorless, and had bits of bacon fat floating at the top. So I switched to seasonal pumpkin, which tasted like cardboard. Fresh pumpkin is great, but some can be bitter or watery and lack flavor. The chef did nothing to compensate, no salt even. The croissant could have easily been from Costco, which given the vats of pastry filling (long list of ingredients) I saw them use to fill a turnover, I wouldn't be surprised. They might look quaint, but that's not how they cook."
2,"I ordered my usual (at most sushi restaurants I go to), spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. Both tasted fine, but they were mostly filler, cucumber strips inside the spicy tuna roll 50/50 split and imitation crab inside the shrimp tempura roll. Plus it was $2 more for the lunch special than other restaurants. However they do offer soup and salad with the lunch portion which may justify the higher price."
1,"I don't think it's fair to rate a casino on how mush you win....but I think it's very fair to rate a casino on its employees and dealers. Which at this casino for the most part, aren't very good. Not mean, they just speed through the game and don't add anything fun to it. \n\nDrink ladies are few and far between and the table games act like changing $50 is a big deal. I know it's not Vegas but come on."
4,What a breakfast!! Chorizo and eggs with side of pancakes instead of toast; corned beef hash skillet with sourdough bread. The portions are slightly large which questions your ability to clean your plate. Great value for the price and everything taste so good. \n\nThe servers are all attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nThe restaurant is going through a make-over in their decor and so far it looks awesome. Do you think that would hamper their service and food quality? NO!  Now that's how to run a successful business.
2,"Different day, different order, same issues as previous review.  Ordered salad with pulled pork.  Pulled pork tasted good and helping was plentiful.  Salad underneath was clearly made by someone who doesn't eat salad.  Wrong kind of lettuce - some sort of really rough romaine.  Cut across the leaf so EVERY SINGLE bite of lettuce contained some of the rib down the middle of the leaf - you know the part every one else cuts out and throws away.  I had to cut the end part off the tomato myself. Mushrooms were fresh and tasty.  Corn bread could have been browner but it tasted good.  Now on to customer service.  Waiter very good, very attentive BUT some crazy person running the restaurant must have taken a bad credit card some time in the past so they ask every single person using a credit or debit card to show ID.  I am a consultant in the credit card industry and 59 year old. I understand credit card risk and customer service.  I would say the average customer age was 50 or over.  You are insulting us by requiring us to show ID for $10-$30 meals.  Increase my meal by a dollar if you're really losing tons of money to bad cards but don't ask me for ID.\n\nWill I be back again.  Yes the BBQ is that good."
2,"Pros: the were well-stocked with US priority mail boxes and they even had tape available for customers, which is a rarity in most USPS locations nowadays. \n\nCounter worker Craig was really helpful to a couple of customers while I was in line. Seemed like they were all nice folks working here. \n\nCons: multiple reviewers on other sites have indicated they have seen evidence of mail handlers loosing packages and opening packages for no apparent reasons. Hopefully they've got that sorted out now! I was a bit wary but I wasn't sending or receiving anything critical. Still, you have to be a bit worried when you see people mention stuff like that...."
4,"I really enjoyed the medium-rare rib eye as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection, but what I enjoyed even more were the pork chops!  Bone in tender chops cooked barely pink covered in a delicious, light sauce.  I'm getting moist just thinking about it."
1,"We tried it because of rave reviews we have heard, but left disappointed.  The ambiance was fine execpt towards the end of our meal they decided to adjust a table nearby and it became like a construction zone with drills and loud power tools.  Granted it was during lunch, but we still felt it could have been done at another time when most of the restaurant was not full.\n\nThe burgers were okay, but not at all what I would consider great.  They were not very juicy, or flavorful in and of themselves, but there were interesting toppings to choose from. And, despite the burgers not being juicy the bottom of the buns were falling apart.\n\nThe service was pleasant but the food didn't really hit the mark on our visit."
1,"Hate getting stuck here when I need to eat. There aren't very many choices and after you go through security the choices get even slimmer.  Bluck.  \n\nHowever, getting through security generally is better other airports, but that's primarily due to their size.  \n\nOff site car rental is a drag and adds a lot of extra time.  Always seem to be just missing a bus when I return the car and have to wait."
4,Got my oil change there tonight. Friendly staff didn't try to push products on me In N Out 30 minutes would recommend this location to anyone
0,"WOW I am definitely surprised by the number of stars this place has been rated by people. This was probably THE MOST disappointing meal of my life. I ordered a pasta, described as with pecorino and pepper , and this was exactly what I got.  It was disgustingly plain looking,  as it was just narrow, long pasta noodles with pepper, cream,  EXTREME amounts of salt, and the cheese (pecorino) was melted and mixed in.  It was NOT even garnished with any parsley or any greens, it was just plain pasta--no veggies at all.  Presentation was horrible. It was just piled on a very plain plate, not even on an attractive plate.  It tasted like I just threw a box of spaghetti noodles in, mixed some cheese in and threw some pepper on. This place is in a PRIME location at Venetian, so I was definitely surprised at the quality of the food. Mario Batali, your name has forever been tarnished in my mind because your name is on this restaurant. My meal was the most dissatisfying meal I have ever had, and to top it off, I PAID someone to make me this horrible dish, I didn't even make myself the worst meal of my life!!!  It was $17, which I thought to myself (based on the location/looks/chef Mario Batali's name on the restaurant) seemed like a bargain, but I was let down almost instantaneously with one bite. The best part of this visit was probably the packaged breadsticks they give you in the beginning of the meal-- yes, individually packaged breadsticks, which were not even good. \n\nI went in a group of about 7 people, and I tried everyone's dish-- it all tasted the same--but theirs just looked better. I thought maybe I had just picked the bad menu item, but they were all bad!! I think though the worst dish was the \""salad\""--and we were all confused because the \""salad\"" included radicchio + mozzarella. It sounded good on the menu--although I am not a fan of radicchio because of the strong bitter taste, I decided to try it. To my surprise there existed a dish even WORSE than my own! It was not a bed of fresh, raw veggies + fresh mozzarella-- it was in fact cooked radicchio mixed with melted mozzarella. It was an epic mess. \n\nSo disappointed by Mario Batali's cuisine. I will NEVER be returning here NOR will I be going to any of his restaurants because clearly this restaurant is ruining his image, and nothing is being done about it. \n\nI will NEVER be returning to this restaurant,"
1,Place is ok if you're looking for a cheap price.  Food was ok..I had better.  Not that much food selection for a chinese restaurant.  Service was extremely slow.  I guess u get what u pay for.
4,I was delightfully surprised by the southern comfort food and hospitality. I especially devoured the BBQ pork chop. The staff is friendly and foodie savvy. Get extra napkins... Or just lick your fingers. It's that delicious. Seriously addictive!
1,"UPDATE, FEBRUARY 2013: I was pretty disappointed with my most recent experience here. I used to love JB as evidenced below, but maybe things aren't managed as well as they used to be. \n\nThe waitress focused solely on an 8-top and ignored my two-person table for over 35 minutes. It might have gone on longer but we left at that point, in favour of the sublime DVLB. The large table was disruptive, noisy and acted like high schoolers (men wearing neon bras over their clothes) and made the entire place way too loud. No one asked them to keep it down. After two rounds of drinks, we would have liked to order appetizers and more cocktails, but we were completely forgotten. Not sure when I'll be back to JB. \n\nOLD REVIEW, 2012: Man, I love this place. The food is fresh and lovely, from an amazing veggie menu that offers something for everyone. I love their drinks, too, especially the Sweet Jane and the Calamity Jane. The servers are friendly and not pushy, which I like, and you can have a nice drink with some snacks for a good price."
0,"Well, we missed our train out of Montreal because the rude receptionist didn't \""understand my accent\"" (I'm from New York) and the cab showed up at the wrong house. When we called back the receptionist told us it was too late and that there were no more cars for me, and that it was my fault. I don't understand how a cab company can be so disorganized and unprofessional that they would blame the customer for their lack of competence. It is their ONLY job, couldn't they double check that they had the address right?? Long story short I'm stuck in Montreal for another day."
1,calamari was the worst I have had ever in my life. Definitely did not look like the pictures. It was just a bunch of bread crumbs and prepubescent squid bodies  Pasta was ok but had to wait 30 mins even though I had a reservation. For shame..............
4,"This place is very good when it comes to quality, quantity, and price. Compared to many of the other sushi joints on the West side of town. I love ordering their Spicy Yellow Tail, Dynamite Salad, and Tako Yaki Balls.... did I mention they all happen to be on the hour hour menu?! Their happy hour menu is pretty huge and can satisfy your, fresh/raw or savory/cooked cravings. Not only is their sushi great, but their entrees as well. Happy Hour here isn't the standard Mon-Thurs. I don't know the exact days or times, but I know for sure its all day Sunday!!"
4,"The biscotti is as amazing as ever.\n\nIn my countless visits here, I just realized that there is a connecting cafe that serves up Italian fare. We were a tad too early for lunch so I'll definitely give it a go around the next time around. \n\nAnother cool thing is that the biscotti can now be purchased prepackaged by flavor and Larry assured me that they ship the goods!"
2,"The food is pretty basic.  This is not a place really made for dining in there's a large table a little space inside and theirs barely any room to have 2 people walk around inside. Service was quick and friendly. They're open and delivery 24hrs a day. So that's cool. They have some good pizza deals. Prices were OK for about $20 I got a large one topping pizza, mozzarella sticks and bread sticks."
3,"Went for breakfast this morning. Everything was made fresh, even the bran muffin came hot out of the oven. It was busy, but slowed down while there. Our server Cheryl was great, stayed on top of service and very friendly. Great prices too. $3.99 kids breakfast and pretty big portions for that money. Only thing, the changing table in the restroom could use a disinfecting scrub down."
2,"It is a shame to have to knock off a star, but the Huxley has been quite disappointing as of late. \nThe service is really good. The food is very tasty.  \nMy current issues is with the loudness of the bar. It doesn't matter where I stand/sit I have to shout to get myself heard. \nThe other thing is the tables, the wooden type barrel top tables are nice to look at, but when you lean on them with any kind of fabric, they get stuck to the table. I found this out with one of my favourite jumpers, some of it may still be part of that table. \n\nI understand these tables are not easy to clean, but it happens to be really sticky and that can't be the idea behind this. \n\nSo for that 1 star off."
4,"Just had omg chicken. That is the name for it, and omg it was amazing. It is a grilled chicken breast with a spicy cilantro honey pesto, jalape\u00f1o jack cheese over napa cabbage slaw on ciabatta bread"
3,"I've been here a few times now and each time has been consistent. This is a decent place with interesting burger combos and eclectic decor. \n\nMy most recent burger there was \""la boeuf,\"" which was a patty, melted cheddar cheese and jalape\u00f1os. Sounds simple enough, but it was actually pretty delicious. Like Taco Bell without the pain. I always go for the sweet potato fries and the spicy mayo, both fantastic. \n\nI've had some not so memorable items off the menu too: their Mac n cheese and grilled cheeses are very basic. Nothing special about them at all.\n\nI've tried a cocktail off their menu too. I'm not a cocktail guy, and this place certainly didn't convert me. It was a whisky ginger with some leaves in it and probably a syrup too. Too sweet. \n\nAll in all, this place has a very good selection of burgers and I never hesitate to suggest this place when looking for a bite in Laval."
2,"Food decent, service lacks. They need to buy our waiter Powers a personality. I will give another."
0,"THERE WAS A ROACH IN MY FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy curiosity for Indian food and decent reviews convinced me to give this place a try today.  Huge mistake!!!  I was a little skeptical after reading one review that described someone elses \""roach\"" experience.  Since the rest of the reviews were decent, I decided to disregard it, thinking maybe it was someone who simply had a bad experience and was wanting to give the restaurant a bad name.  \n\nI placed a take out order over the phone.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I picked up my food, returned to work excited for my lunch, until I found a big roach sitting on top of my rice.  Luckily, I hadn't taken any bites!\n  \nI wasted my entire lunch hour, only to find myself hungry, with no time to get anything else.  The manager explained that the restaurant had just been sprayed for roaches, which he claims makes them spread everywhere.  Good to know right?\n\nIn the end, I was given a full refund but it didn't make up for my time and disgusting experience.\n\nThe manager seemed to really make light of the situation.  Apparently he's okay with his \""tenants\"".  Unless you're okay with having an extra crunch in your food, you really shouldn't eat here."
3,"Enjoyable fresh flavors with crispy fresh chips, relaxed atmosphere and nice friendly bar."
4,"A big, beautiful museum in a gorgeously renovated historic building: what's not to love? The permanent collection and most of the rotating exhibitions are totally free, and there's usually one paid exhibit on at any given time, as well. \n\nCurrently one of the free exhibitions is the BP Portrait Prize, which is always one of the highlights of the year for those of us who love contemporary portrait painting (and if you don't, come on, why are you bothering to read a review of a portrait museum at all?)."
1,"Mediocre at best. \n\nCame here for a late Mother's Day lunch with my husband and son. The place was fairly packed so we took it as a good sign. I ordered the trio enchiladas and my husband ordered a carne asada Torta. We were craving tacos as well so we decided to share 3 al pastor tacos. Service was incredibly slow. Yes it was Mother's Day but we had arrived at around 1:30, a time when most of the crowd was dying out and the place wasn't even really packed to begin with. \n\nWe waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out and were very disappointed. The black beans had no flavor whatsoever and the rice was also pretty bland. None of the dishes had enough meat. My husband said the torta was okay but did not taste like carne asada. It was mainly bread and hardly any meat. The same with my chicken enchiladas. They hardly had any cheese or chicken. I just kept cutting into tortillas soaked in sauce. When we tried the al pastor tacos. \n\nWe saw they incorporated pineapple chunks into it. Again, hardly any meat and most of it was pineapple. They should have been called pineapple tacos. I didn't mind the pineapples in there, but my husband picked them out. \n\nI feel that sometimes, places like these try too hard to be different by changing something that really works into something totally different and disappointing. \n\nOver all, I would not come here again. It's overpriced, bland, Americanized food with not so great service."
4,2 dozen oysters. 30 cocktail shrimp. 6 king crab legs. \ncookies. cheesecake. chocolate. fresh fruit. \n$38.\n\nComing back to the hotel room and getting on the scale to find myself with a 5 pound seafood baby about to pop.\nPriceless.\n\nHands down the BEST seafood buffet in town! Don't even bother with any of the other buffets  (except perhaps the Wynn's) because this one definitely hits the spot!\n\nI think this might be the place where the SO officially got it through his head that I'm a piggy!
3,Excellent food served well by a personable wait staff.\nGreat ambiance albeit noisy.\nShrimp Bisque was Outstanding.\nSome marvelous craft beers with too limited a Growler offering.\nWe be back.
3,"I've been here sporadically for the past 4.5 years, starting  when I was underage and living with my sis who lives RIGHT around the corner (yay!) and up through my biannual holiday visits.  I must say that during those few years, either my bar/restaurant perspective has changed, or they really have worked out some of their kinks.  I used to get the impression that the employees were kind of too-cool-for-school, and I wasn't a huge fan of how their menu ordering was set up.  But the more I think about it, the cooler it is.  Here we go:\n\nYou have a list of ingredients that you can choose from to make any number of combinations of pizza (by the slice or whole!) which is made-to-ORDER.  You WILL be waiting for your food for a minute or two, but that's what the BAR is for...and did I mention:  Your slice is not sitting around in a steam display getting wonky!!  \n\nYou also have the choice of selecting from a menu of sandwiches already compiled, or again you can choose your own ingredients, up to three (don't quote me on that) for no charge, but any additional ingredients are a small charge on top of that.  You have cheeses, veggies (RRP, anyone?) and delish hummus as choices.  Again, your meal is made to order.\n\nAnything you can make a sandwich with, you can morph into a salad, if you desire.  Options are the name of the game here.  And who doesn't like options?\n\nAdditionally, the bar is not run by frilly, cutesy, annoyingly dim-witted bar wenches.  The girls behind the bar have been very cool and down to earth.  The most recent visit, I was being my usual indecisive self and didn't know what I was looking for in a beer.  The bartender (it was on a Monday night and I cannot remember her name, forgive me!) happily and nonchalantly recommended \""Black Strap\"" which I think is brewed locally.  It was heavenly and I don't know why I hadn't already tried it. \n\nThere is plenty of table seating, a small-small-small outdoor seating area out front on the sidewalk for the summer and/or year-round smokers (shame on you!) and a nice comfy long bar to belly up to.   \n\nYou can get a decent dart game on here, but not much else.\n\nThe jukebox, at first glance, DOES seem to leave a lot to be desired but once you put more than a dollar in....the search engine will open up and you can have your way with the tunes.  It's not ALL that bad if you know what you're looking for and not just blindly picking crap.  Plus there's plenty of TV's to be had, so you can tune out the noise while you're focusing on whatever is on ESPN at the moment."
2,"(Lyrics - Katy Perry - Hot N Cold)\n\nYou serve your food\nIn a bag, while it's warm\nYeah your, crawfish spice (stings!)\nLike a bitch, I would know\n\nAnd I over think\nAlways order the dungeness\nI should know\nThat you're so good for me.....\n\nCause you're HotNJuicy\nI'm Yum then I'm Ohh\nI'm in then I'm out\nI'm up then I'm down\n\nA well respected establishment that has a reputation from Vegas to LA and now PHX!\n\nI came with a couple of my gal pals since one of us attended Angry Crab about a month ago and was delighted. We ordered pretty much the simple things, 1lb of crawfish with the Hot N Juicy sauce at medium, oysters, dungeness crab, and some wings and cajun fries.\n\nFirst off, I went for the oyster; definitely not the freshest, but hey we live in a desert! Then the crawfish; much larger than I'm used to so kudos on that.  The sauce is what makes the crawfish boil here.  I thought it grainy and thick and probably could be a little more watery.  The wings, well I had better else where since they were quite soggy. The cajun fries were good and crunchy and finally based on my friends take, the dungeness crab was pretty good. I'd say the sauce was okay at best, but nothing too WOW!\n\nIn the end, I guess I don't get the rave about these crawfish eateries, but can appreciate them. My overall service was excellent. The ambiance was tacky as most crawfish joints, but I would recommend a hand cleaning station outside the restrooms. - Enjoy!"
4,"Went there on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend for \""Taco Tuesday.\"" Very cool atmosphere! The server was extremely nice and the food was delicious!"
2,"A colleague suggested we go to the Rio buffet after our conference ended. I'm normally opposed to buffets, since they seem to believe that stuffing you beyond all reason is compensation for mediocre food.\n\nI was surprised at the Rio. The quantity was certainly there, and the \""they didn't cheat me\"" mentality was in full effect. The food itself was actually decent. I had some prime rib that was near-perfect. Frankly, when I get crab legs, I like to get as many as possible. It was an excellent situation. The desserts were very good, without being too sweet. Our waiter cleared the table quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe only downer was observing the unabashed gluttony of other individuals. My colleagues noted listening to people complain about not enough when they've had two pounds of lobster tails is just shameful."
0,"Bad, bad, bad.  Moved to the Valley from Tucson and based on many yelper's comments decided to try Nando's to get our Mexican food fix.  There was a line out the door and the place was packed.  We had high hopes.  Guacamole tasted like something purchased in a refrigerated section of the grocery store.  Salsa tasted like tomato sauce.  Neither my husband nor I could finish the food.  Bland, not the least bit authentic and downright gross.  Took the leftovers home to my teenage kids (they usually eat everything).  They took one bite and discarded the rest...citing that Taco Bell was more authentic.  My only assumption can be that those that have yelped have never experienced authentic Mexican food."
1,"Worest frederick's of Hollywood I have ever been in. No selection, and unhappy and unhelpful sales people. The one sales girl was just sitting on the floor behind the register like she didn't even want to be there, the other couldn't help me find what I was looking for. Don't go to this one, use the fashion show or boulavard location!!"
4,Very cute store. Good selection for baby and a great staff. Talk to Sarah if you have questions about cribs! She was very knowledgeable.
2,"Decent Irish pub, great staff"
4,"Hour-glass figures are supposed to be fun, but sometimes they're a real pain, requiring custom tailoring and alterations to prevent an unshapely form. After a last minute invite to a charity event, requiring a prom-themed cocktail dress, I showed up at Zizzo the day of the event, dress in hand, hoping for alterations assistance. In less than 20 minutes the fitting was complete and two hours later I picked up my dress. The owner personally did the fitting and also referred me to an incredible dry cleaner, who steamed the dress and had it ready for me (he didn't even charge!). Zizzo's is SO good that I drive from Tempe and haven't used anyone else since!"
3,I love getting the half soup (the potato cream cheese)  and half sand (typically I get the BLT and add some Turkey!). \n\nIts a great place to get out of the office as they have electrical outlets at almost every table so be sure to bring your laptop and enjoy the free wifi.
4,"There is NOTHING about this place that I didn't LOVE. Really I don't want to eat pizza anywhere else again.\n\nOur waitress recommended and incredible wine- that of course I can't remember the name of. A red blend- Tamas maybe?\n\nShe also recommended the pizza we ordered. Red sauce, italian sausage, ricotta cheese & roasted red bell peppers. Heaven, no kidding.\n\nAnd to think that I have never had a glassy of wine with my pizze before- my life was changed FOREVER!.\n\nWe started with the antipasto- while simple was divine, perfect combo of all things delicious!\n\nRandom fact: in the kitchen they have a chemist come in and match the pH and mineral content of the water to the water in new york- so that the food they make tasted the same. Who knew?\n\nFinished off the meal with a slice of Bailey's and Cream cheesecake (also made fresh in the Grimaldi's kitchen).... to die for.\n\nThanks for changing my life :)"
1,I placed my order and got what I wanted.  That's fine.  But why was I bothered by the Barney Fife rent-a-cop?  He had the nerve to keep coming past me and after he asked a bunch of dumb questions.  Oh Maybe It's Because I Look A Certain Way...
1,"I rated this location poorly because of the manner the store employees processed my return. I walked in at 5:45 PM and purchased a data card reader and battery charger for my Sony camera [universal]. I returned the next morning to return both items as my camera was stolen. \n\nI was told the store did not accept returns on battery chargers. I was told the policy existed because of people like me [who were from out of town]. I was told these people forgot their chargers at home and would buy the item, use it, and return it. I felt as if my integrity was being questioned. I felt my integrity being quesstioned. While I undertsand the compelxities of owning ande running a private camera shop, I felt the store did nothing to make amends. While I try to support private business, this situation maes me want to go to one of the \""big chain\"" stores with a more \""liberal\"" return policy. \n\nThe packages were unopened and factory sealed! What could have made this experience  better was being told about the return policy when I purchased the items. I lost $40 on a $70 purchase. Rather than being told beforehand about the policy, I was told after the fact \""You should have read the return policy\"". I do not know anyone who stops to read the return policy before making a purchase. I learned my lesson. I will always ask about a store's return policy before making a purchase.\n\nI strongly caution you to read their policies before buying anything. Cameras must be returned within 7 days and most items are non-returnable."
3,"Los Angeles Korean-American approved is all I'll say! \nBeen to all the Korean restaurants here in Madison at Sol's got that authentic kimchi stew that I can only get back at home. The spicy pork and beef bulgogi is good. The spicy cold noodles are good as well. Is kimchi is not your thing, stay safe with the hot stone bibimbap, bulgogi and tonkatsu. The side dishes are delicious- the way they should taste. Of course, this is a Korean speaking. So give it a try and see what ya think. Only reason for the four stars... The service. It's usually a wait when busy, since it's a family run business and not lots of servers."
0,"When our son started here 2 years ago it was amazing . The instructors were phenomenal and my son really LOVED karate.  They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only 4 at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they don't send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my son's main passion and now it's really fizzled out.  He was in the same class for over 9 months and had so many younger/new kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didn't make him any better of a fighter.  Sad to see it go downhill so fast but we won't be back."
3,"Oh man, this place is awesome! You get to choose what type of pancakes you want, so I chose banana chocolate chip and they were delicious and huge. You get three pancakes and I had to take two home to finish later. My friend got the stuffed French toast with bacon and again, delicious.\n\nThe food came fast but the waitress wasn't all that attentive. She was pleasant enough but we received no coffee or water refills. That's pretty much the only complaint. If you're in the area, definitely stop and check this out."
2,"Took the advice of another reviewer and ordered the rasberry chipolte wings which were really tasty...sounds like a variety of their wings are good.  And yes, the bartenders laziness and lack of personality was a real downer.  It's not good to be sarcastic when someone in your group orders water, then to wait for menu's to only be told they would have been brought to us, not true.  May go back sometime and try other wings but isn't urgent on my list."
0,"Last night, I reserved a table for 12 based on the recommendation of friends whose opinions I trust who raved about the place.  Unfortunately, what we received last night was easily the worst food and service I've experienced in a very long time. It's times like this that you wish Yelp would allow zero stars.\n\nThe night began innocently enough; we were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time in a room that can best be described as spartan; but no matter, some of my favorite restaurants in the world aren't much to look at.\n\nWe placed our order, and then waited   ... and waited ... and waited.  The wait staff was obviously mortified as they avoided any interaction with tables as no one in the entire restaurant was eating anything.  My brother actually got up and walked over to Taco Bell to get himself something to tide himself over.  Finally, after over 50 minutes, our server emerged to tell us that they were out of the chicken fingers one of the kids had ordered from the kids menu.  So we now know that it wasn't that the food was taking an exceedingly long time to cook, but rather, no one had touched our ticket for almost an hour.  Amazing since no food had emerged from the kitchen that entire time.\n\nAt this point, my brother had had enough and walked out with his kids to go get them something to eat.  Our table of 12 had just become 8.  About a half hour later, food finally began to emerge.\n\nI ordered the steak frites medium rare.  The steak I received was way past medium, no pink inside at all.  And even properly cooked, this small steak and pile of ordinary fries was a $17 plate at best, not $22.\n\nMy wife had ordered the lobster chili rellenos.  Why they call them rellenos is beyond me.  First, there was only one little stuffed pepper in the middle of the plate.  Secondly it was not battered and fried as rellenos should be.  Both might be excusable but when the lobster inside is still frozen, it is not.\n\nWe tried to get our servers attention to address the problem, but she wasn't having any of it.  She actually did a 540 degree circle around our table, managing to avoid seeing me trying to flag her down, and made a beeline back into the kitchen.\n\nTo be fair, I doubt she would have been any help as she explained earlier when we asked why it took so long to inform us they were out of chicken fingers that \""she wasn't the kitchen\"".  True enough, but you're our liaison to the kitchen ... aren't you?\n\nFinally we actually flagged down another waitress and explained the problem with my wifes dish, and although everyone else was obviously finished, instead of offering to just drop the dish from our bill, she insisted they make her another one to go.  Even if the dish were perfect, there is no way it was worth $28; even two would not be.\n\nThe bill finally arrived and to make up for the problems, we were informed that the drinks had been comped (since out of the 8 of us we ordered maybe 3 drinks).  The final tab for 8 people who waited eons for absolute crap? $200.\n\nNeedless to say I had a lengthy conversation with the manager on the way out who apologized profusely and intimated that whoever was in the kitchen wouldn't be there for long.\n\nGood luck to you, but I think I'll let you fix your restaurant without using me as a guinea pig.  Never again."
4,"This place is a hidden gem..... Come on, Filet Mignon meatballs... NEED I SAY MORE?!?  I loved the sevice and food, we actually visited this restuarant twice during our say in Vegas.."
3,"Reasonable prices.  Some Mediteranian restaurants will charge you $3 extra if you don't want all rice and want to do half a salad, But at the ZK, half and half is the standard, and for about $10.  I did a lamb and all rice dinner.  The lamb was \""buttery\"" which hopefully was ghee and not seasoned with herbs the way most do it.  The rice is awesome although I have been there a couple of times and once got a little bit of saffron rice on top, and the second time got a lot. Definitely had a good experience, and worth the money.\nNot much for ambiance, but hey, I was there for the food."
4,"My wife and I have been cooking more for ourselves.  As we do many restaurants aren't worth it.  Pitta always delivers.  Great specials, and great regular menu items.  The staff is awesome and always makes us feel at home.  They have a great beer selection too.  The only thing I will say negative about the place is that most people that order the platters will probably want the potatoes cooked to a crispness on the outside.  Just ask they will do it.  The way they usually do it is under-cooked in my opinion.   I also wish they brewed the plain tea.\n\nFor dessert I recommend the pourekia.  It is great.  The description doesn't do it justice.  The cheese is more like cream.  The cheese cakes are also excellent."
0,"I went in to pick up a dvd set I ordered online. The cashier at the pick-up section was very rude. I asked for a store receipt and she rolled her eyes and told me that she was going to hand me a copy of my receipt. I understand the amount of teenagers who work at the store but I expected more well-mannered people. I also did not like getting followed by a staff member who probably thought I was going to steal. This is why I shop at Amazon, cheaper prices and great customer service."
3,"I've been here since late July and figured I would wait a few months to see how I like the apartment before I write a review. Compared to other apartment complex reviews that I've seen about unfriendly staff, Verde wins this. With such a small number of apartments they can actually get things done in a timely manner, including maintenance requests, although the only requests I've had are my lightbulbs.\n\nI live in the A1 floorplan and coming from NYC this place feels huge, it may not feel that way for you. I have a rug and no balcony and I paid in the mid 800s but that was in July, prices go up in the winter. One thing to note is you will be taxed on your rent which is an additional $15/month for me + water, sewage, garbage, which is another $20 or so, keep that in mind, either I wasn't told that when I was looking or I wasn't paying attention. \n\nDuring the summer my electric bill was around $85 (I'm a stickler when it comes to electricity and running my A/C, I kept my apartment at 82 during the day and 74 at night. I assume if you have it running all day you'll get hit pretty hard. The ceiling fans are nice and help a bit. I haven't run my A/C much in November and I believe my bill was around $40.\n\nThe pool area is small and gets shady pretty quickly and the walls are a bit thing, but I'm on the third floor, I can hear a dog barking in the apartment next to me, but that's what you get with apartment living. My apartment is dusty, I keep the windows open, so you'll need a vacuum if you get an apartment with a rug, if I had known the amount of dust that's in AZ i may have splurged for hardwood. The workout room is small but functional, I belong to the 24 hr fitness down the road and it's cheap.\n\nI do like living here and there's a very good chance I'll renew my lease in July."
4,Ok.\nIt is literally just a BBQ shack in the middle of this dirt lot.\nBut the food is amazing.\nLike amazing.\nWorth waiting outside in the horrible Vegas heat to get it good.\nThe place also gets points for giving free bottled water to patrons as they wait to go order and get their grub on.
1,"The service was very attentive, but the food was not good. \n\nThe foie gras was too chilled to the point of frozen and tasted terrible. I would not go back. It was expensive and we left hungry."
1,"I have been to other  Zipps,  and even this one, before and the food and service have been great, which would be why we went there again today. BIG change!\n\nThe restaurant might have had 8 tables busy at the lunch hour.  The waiters was very nice but service from the kitchen was really slow.\n\nWe ordered the burger with a chili and pepper jack cheese, a basket of fries and sweet potato chips, and a BLT. We both ordered Ice tea.\n\nWe sent the ice tea back because it tasted as it if it had been filtered through a mold screen. I commented that the ice tea  container might not have been cleaned recently. I got water and my friend ordered a Coke. I got my water but the Coke arrived as a sprite. That is a waitress issue.\n\nMy burger tasted as it was not fully cooked but on checking it seemed to be properly cooked. I kept eating it but kept thinking this might be a bad idea. \n\nMy friend sent the french fries back because they were just barely cooked. I tried one and sure enough, almost raw potato. The sweet potato chips on the other had were cooked to death.\n\nIt is now 30 minutes late and I am pretty sure that burger is coming back up shortly. When I sensed that \""just a little off\"" taste I  should have refused to eat it.\n\nThe waiters took the fries basket and the tea off the bill so she was trying. Mixing  up Coke with Sprite and then ignoring us was a mistake that got noticed in the tip."
4,"This place is awesome!!! very modern and you get floor to ceiling windows with an awesome view of the strip.. Make you get the even room number  though so that you would actually be facing the strip...or else your view will be ross and 7-11 lolz.. I think the best view would be on floors 25-30 ... Fashion Mall is just right across so if you dont gamble you can always go shopping... THe pool is awesome probably one of the best in LV. They even have Nude area if your into that. If your into the club scene, make sure you check out Club XS... Loved my stay there...THe biggest plus for me is that... It doesnt smell like cigarettes just like all the other older hotels..."
4,"Kosama is the best gym I've joined yet. The overall experience is bar-none compared to other crossfit gyms I've been to. The trainers are highly qualified and are there to motivate you to get the best results possible. \""Mind over body!!\"" Whether a novice, intermediate, or beginner, Kosama is perfect. No commitment to worry about either. Class times accommodate all schedules as well. I am Kosama!"
1,"My husband, his co worker and I  went to Monti's for lunch at 11:30 am. There was a  festival on Mill and we couldn't get to Corleone's without paying $10 for parking. \n\nWe waited about 15 minutes only to be seated and find that the place was very empty! We didn't get bread, but maybe they don't offer it during lunch. No biggie. \n\nWe ordered our food and waited, and waited. It took a good 30 minutes to get our food. I ordered a southwest grilled chicken sandwich and onion rings. It was pretty good and arrived hot. My husband and his friend ordered the NY strip sandwich, one with chicken noodle soup and one with a baked potato. \nBoth sandwiches were cold (but still tasty) as was the soup (I was told the soup was not tasty). \n\nGripes: We didn't get a 'sorry for the long wait' and the sides were teeny tiny.\n\n\nThe food: Good\nThe service: Ok\nThe wait for a table: Terrible\nThe wait for food: Terrible"
1,"If you've ever read any of my reviews you'll know that I have spent a considerable time in Korea and have a Korean wife so Korean grocery stores are a place we visit on a regular basis.  Therefore I feel inclined to review Seoul Mart.  Seoul Mart has figured out that they have a monopoly in an area with a massive amount of Korean students and faculty.  The only other comparable Korean marts are too far away for the majority of students therefore they're forced to shop at Seoul Mart if they want a taste of home. I see a lot of people saying that the staff are cold and hard to deal with, you're 100% if I go without my wife they treat me like I am pestering them, when my goes they're extremely outgoing and talk to me like I am a completely different person.  \nNext, the prices here are a bit high borderline ridiculous you can get the same stuff at Sambok, Youngs, Trader Joes, Market District, or Orient Mart on McKnight for cheaper.  For example we like Mochi Ice cream (not Korean) at Seoul Mart it's 5.99 at Trader Joe's it's 3.99.  Lesson is unless it's something Korean that you absolutely cannot find elsewhere there really is no point going to Seoul Mart.\nUnfortunately for me I have to go from time to time because their selection is the best in the 'Burgh....\n\nPROS -\nSelection\nConvenience \n\nCONS -\nPrices\nRude/Apathetic Staff (to non-Koreans)\nLimited Prices\nCluttered"
4,Great selection of food and salad. \nStellar service\nSurely a great dining experience
0,"This place has not only destroyed my favorite dish but has also offended a national cuisine.  Pho is the national Vietnamese dish. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be so many restaurants with it in the name like this place.  Any place worth its salt has a go-to recipe that satisfies anyone craving the soup.  \n\nSo who can mess up something as important as Pho?  This place.  They have done it in a manner that offends Vietnamese cuisine in no other way I have ever before experienced.  This national cuisine is considered one of, if not THE, freshest food on the planet.  \n\nWho ruins Pho Ga?  This place.  Unfortunately, this place has no idea about freshness.  Pho is a healthy, nutritious, and savory soup.  Simple, yet elegant.  The atrocity they served me was not only bland, but so oily that I couldn't get rid of the clammy sensation from my mouth for hours.  The meager chicken pieces floating in it were not only bland, but exceedingly DRY.  So dry that I had to drink the bland iced tea they served so as to swallow, because the broth was so oily and revolting.  Unfortunately, I was so hungry I forced myself to gnaw on the the chicken and the hard noodles.\n\nMy partner's hot and spicy soup with shrimp was as greasy or more.  In fact, the oil beaded up on our spoons repelling the water-based soup.  She said the shrimp had freezer burn in its taste.  She also tried to salvage something edible from her horror.\n\nThe sad thing is that we spent over 30 minutes trying to find the place as a result of Yelp when we looked for a place in Mesa.  So I had to warn people about this joint.  Unfortunately, we weren't aware that there were 2 different places right down the road in Chandler.\n\nSo for Vietnamese cuisine's sake - Do NOT eat here.  I wish we could get away with not having to give one star.  It was so bad.  The sad thing is that the appetizer of Spring Rolls was actually decent, then the crap hit the fan.  Or in this case, the Pho."
0,Ordered a mini chicken Katsu to go and what a disappointment.  It was a mini of a mini plate.  not worth the exuberant price you charge your customers.  better places around town that gives more.
3,"i don't care what anyone says, i loved the flamingo. my bf and i got a great deal here a couple years ago. before we went everyone was saying \""well its not the nicest hotel in vegas but its ok.\"" so i didn't know what to except, but from the front desk all the way to our room it was great. we arrived a few hours early but still got to check into our room and  they even gave us one a few floors higher with a really cool view of the gardens. the room was super clean, big and the bed was pretty comfy. and there was a huge picture window which was cool if you're feeling a little frisky. uhhhh i mean.....\n\nhuge plus that margaritaville was attached to it. we ate there pretty much everyday.\nand osheas casino was right next door where we won all our money.\ngo see vinnie favorito hes an effin riot."
1,"In a perfect world, when a lady orders a pizza, she could always expect 12 inches of pure warm scrumptiousness, obtained through the brilliant combination of these two elements: fresh, high-quality & tasty ingredients, & a divine crust, neither too thin nor too thick, smooth, elastic, yet slightly crispy, with a subtly salty taste that enhances the topping. A pizza like those at Bottega (I bet they're sent each morning directly from Heaven), or Prato, even.\n\nUnfortunately, this world is not quite perfect, & the pizzas at Pizz\u00e9d\u00e9lic are not remotely close to that. It wasn't so much the cheesy \""trendy\"" square shape, or the overall bland taste, but rather the CRUST; so thin & crumbly & dry, it felt like I was eating chips. For 15,95$ (20 with taxes & tip), I admit I was really disappointed.\n\nI will not say much about the decor (frankly average), or the service (a trashy, hurried for no reason, middle-aged woman), or the prices (definitely too high for what you get); I just suggest you avoid the place."
3,"I ate out on the patio with a group of friends and the atmosphere was great. I ordered a few different tacos and liked them for the most part. My only complaint is that you don't get very much food for your money. But if you were to come during happy hour, the price per taco would be more justified."
0,"I bought a groupon off the Internet which ended up only costing me 5 dollars for 20 to spend here. How could I go wrong! But wait, there's more! Act now and you too can eat an awful, awful (it's awful) lunch. The London broil tasted like it was a good 2-3 days in the fridge already cooked and then reheated to order. It had that sour meat taste that only cell decomp in a cool fridge can give you. Cornbread, stale. Peaches, canned. I was hassled about having to print my groupon (it's a mobile world, it doesn't work that way). There was a ton of pro life pamphlets and bracelets etc, by the register. My advice would be to make a statement in your cooking, not the abortion argument. I wish I had aborted my mission to try this place."
1,"I don't get the excitement over this place. It's only open two days a week. And they have absolutely nothing of interest on the shelves. Pajar makes beautiful shoes and boots, they just don't sell them in this location. They sell them the places like browns and B2 and little burgundy. The only shoes you'll find here are shoes that weren't nice enough to be sold in real shoe stores five years ago when they were in style. \n\nAnd on top of that, the last time I walked in there I got the rudest service I've ever seen in a shoe store. Some middle-aged lady with an attitude problem and a chip on her shoulder forgot what she did for a living. If you don't like your job do something else."
0,"This is one of the oldest Chinese joints in the city. The food itself was never the greatest or most authentic cuisine but it always worked in a pinch at lunch. The food was always a nice step over a generic carryout place.\n\nNo more.\n\nFood's gone way downhill and the service sucks. Nobody's friendly anymore.\n\nI miss Frank, the previous owner. I hope he's enjoying his retirement somewhere.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"

0,"THIS PLACE BLOWS GOATS!\n\nOn my recent trip to Vegas we were starvin like marvin and found this joint inside Caesar's. We looked at the menu and decided to eat there because the prices were decent and we were ready to consume a cow.\n\nThat was the biggest mistake of the night.\n\nTalk about horrible everything.\n\n1. The food here is not fabulous by any standards and you're going to pay more than you would at any other hotel cafe. 15 dollars for a measly quesadilla WITHOUT chicken.\n\n2. The WORST customer service I have had in a long time. We spent exactly 2 hours here because they never brought us our check and it took almost an hour to get our food which was 2 salads and a quesadilla. \n\n3. They double charged my credit card and I had to call them once I got back to California. They fixed the problem two days later.\n\nMaybe I caught them on a bad night, but c'mon! That wasted most of our first night there. We ended up at this other crappy place for drinks later. Thanks a lot Augustus Cafe-FOR NOTHING!"
2,"It has been over three years since I last dropped in to Blue Ox Tavern.  And up until just a few seconds ago, I was still completely uninformed about the significance of \""Blue Ox\"", except it has some connection to Minnesota.  So if you are curious about the name, here is a brief Cliff Notes notation about this trivia:\n\nBlue Ox is actually named Babe, and is Paul Bunyan's animal companion.\n\nBlue Ox was also a professional roller hockey team based in Minneapolis, MN, that used to played in the Roller Hockey International League.\n\nBut if you are expecting the interior of the tavern/sports bar to be all blue, you will be disappointed.  Hues of light pink is what you will most likely be covered with regardless of where you decided to park your hiney for the duration of your visit. But don't worry, your eyes are very good at filter that out, but it could get problematic when you try to take pictures of your food, menu or other picture worthy subject matters.  \n\nAnyway, I was here recently to catch the slightly more than half of the most boring Super Bowl event in recent memory. The place was fairly busy, but there were still a few tables and booth that were unoccupied when I walked in.  The average age of the patron was easily over 35 (and I am lowballing my guestimate), so if you are looking for young wild and crazy sports bar scene, this is probably not your best bet.  Best surprise of the afternoon was the complimentary half time buffet that was sponsored by a local law firm (the hot links and other sausages and sides were a definite hit).\n\nTheir regular menu is your typical, non-gourmet bar food.  You have your appetizers (mostly fried items and nachos), salads, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items.  I had a bowl of soup (changes daily), and one of their burgers on both visits.  Food is decent and portion is relatively large (but nothing to rave about in our local weekly magazines), and most items are under $10.  \n\nService is decent. The waitresses checks up on you regularly, so your refills or next order of beer is practically effortless.  If you stop in to this sports bar when there are no games on, you could save $1 with your Yelp Check-in off.\n\nOverall, I like this vintage sports bar that has persevered through the years with the occasional event promotions to draw in regulars and snag a few newbies.  Good experience if you are looking for something different from your regular routine.\n\nReview #5 of 2014"
0,"I went here for a business dinner while in Vegas for a trade show. We had a party of 7 and the restaurant was not crowded. I was very, very disappointed with the level of service. We waited 15 minutes for drinks another long time to have someone take our order only to have what was very average...at best...food served.  There are many great restaurants in the Wynn and Encore. I would suggest you go to one of them as this one was terrible all the way around......."
3,"If you are looking for a sophisticated and casual atmosphere with a lot of different menu choices and great service, this is the place. Located in the Gainey Center Shopping area, the Tavern is always fulll of locals and in season, snow birds congregate here. The food ranges from wonderful, creative salads (always fresh) to well prepared fish and meat dishes. The best part of the restaurant is the lodge like atmosphere (the owners are from Colorado), the two sided fireplace that backs to the bar and dining room, and the big, comfy wooden booths that hold 6-8 people. The service is great, too!"
1,"Parma has been one of our favorites for a long time... but now I'm not sure if we'll ever return. This review covers two visits, one in March and again tonight.\n\nIn March, our food took an hour to arrive and only then because we had started asking what the hold up was. The food was okay, nothing memorable, but the 60+ minute wait was. Because of that, we didn't hurry back.\n\nTonight was 45+ minutes and our order wasn't lost. Our server, Kay, almost totally ignored us the entire time. We had to ask another server for soda refills after she ignored them and us for too long. Kay did ask Hubby if his steak was cooked correctly, which it was, then didn't return until we finally got her attention.\n\n My food, a Jidori chicken dish, was inedible. The sauce was good but the chicken was dry and boring. She took it off the bill after I refused to wait another 45 minutes for something else. Hubby's peppercorn steak was abysmal, he said, but we paid for it and got out.\n\nOne bad experience could be a fluke. Two? Marc must not care about this restaurant any longer."
2,"Hidden House has some things you expect in a neighborhood bar: lots of pool tables, giant circular bar, tagged restroom, friendly locals (somehow curious or maybe protective), cheap cocktails and specials on pitchers of beer. Then there's a few things different about this place: an usual mix of suits and sweat pant, old and young, some talented pool players and a really smooth bartender. Located in the \""new\"" downtown and within walking distance from my hotel. The walk there and back was actually as much fun as sitting in the lounge, some parts of downtown are stunning especially at night when the lights are on and nobody's \""home\""."
4,"WOW. We were experiencing a spring heat wave and were tired of wandering the streets of Mont Royal looking for a place to eat. I just pointed to Replika (thinking it was a bar or coffee and dessert shop) and said \""I'M DONE WALKING. WE'RE GOING HERE.\""\n\nWell, this was a stroke of luck! \n\nSince we are vegetarian, we ordered the Simit 2 (see another Yelper's pic of it!) and we loved the turkish bagel and the olive tapenade with the avocado! What a perfect mix! I have been craving it ever since and want to try to make my own version of it here at home (I now live in California.. so can't easily come back here to eat)\n\nWe also had the blueberry roll which was delish. I should have tried their turkish coffee along with it!\n\nThey also have free wifi, the code is on the board next to the register.\n\nLoved the decor and chill vibe here."

This is the place you need to go. \n\nYeah, there's a Denny's on The Strip, but Mr. Mama's offers fresh, delicious meals.\n\nWe (group of 4) drove from San Diego to Vegas. We got there around 11am. Mr Mama's is about 5-10 minutes west of the Strip.\n\nI ordered the Greek omelette: it was really good, the spinach and mushrooms complemented the 4 eggs! that took to prepare this delicious grub. Side of sauteed potatoes.\n\nMy friends ordered:\nThe Denver Omelette: it was tasty and huge! he wasn't able to finish it all\n\nThe girls had the eggs, ham, potatoes, french toast and pancakes. \n\nThis place is a must!\n\nThe service: A+ (you'll have a server walk by and ask if you need anything or if you're ok, every 3-5 minutes)"
1,"First off I have been a patron of BWR & Hungry Monk for the last 3 years. When I first started going there, the service was awesome, the beer was unbelievable and the prices were fair. I loved this bar and told everyone about it. But in the past 6 months, I have noticed the service sucks and the prices are ridiculous! This just makes me mad enough to notice they are always out of the beer I want and the food is awful. Too bad because if they did a little better on the service and stopped being stingy on the prices - I would still be a patron."
0,"Was sold a vacuum sealed bag of grains in a brew kit chock full of insects. When I called ( admittedly 3 months later) the owner said it was my fault I had not used the grains soon enough because the insect eggs were already in the grains. Really??\n    I didn't argue because I had waited, but when I asked him over he phone if he would \nprepare me another bag as I was driving down to the store,  he gave me a long sarcastic sigh and told me I would have to wait because he couldn't  drop everything and deal with my problem!\nWhen I got the store 5 minutes later, no customers were there and the owner wouldn't show his coward face. One of the more helpful employees mix up my bag and I paid him and that is the last money they will ever get out of me."
0,My wife and i used to come here almost every Sunday. I will never go back because of the service of a waitress. Doesn't know how to serve or treat customers. Waited 40 minutes for a cold burger.  filled my sprite with water because she was so busy trying to argue with my wife about old food that was in a fork that she served us and rudely says I don't clean the dishes hunny. She had something smart to say after asking for simple condiments. I have never wrote on yelp before but this service was ridiculous.
0,"Horrible service. Never anyone in there and the owner charged me more money for request no onions !!! Wtf!!!! Any didn't even tell me and charged me !!!! Never going back!!!!!!!!! So much  worst lo mein , shrimp is super hard and so much sprouts barely any noodles !"
1,This outlet sucks. Old and outdated. My local mall is better than this place.\n\nOnly thing good at this place is dunkin donuts.
0,"This place is the worst place ive ever been to, EVER! Ive only been here once for a normal yearly visit and I keep getting a bill because they some how managed to have coded quest diagnostic with a experimental code? My insurance doesn't cover experiments and I received a $500 bill!  Now here's the best part apparently they did an experiment with blood work imagine, I dont know where the blood came from because it didnt belong to me? They never took blood that day. And this all happened in dec 2013 well its almost july 2014 and duh! Its still not fixed. This place sucks! Id be afraid they might lose my baby or something crazy id never trust this place with something so valuable as another life!"
1,bland.
4,Best food ever!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"There was a much-awaited hype for trying this place since it was very well-known both on tour guides and yelp. The food was good but the service wasn't good at all. Maybe that's the norm for super-famous places and I got to get more used to it, but by any standards the guy who waited on me was apathetic and just pushed me to have the smoked meat sandwich when I clearly wanted to try not only the smoked meat but other stuff on the menu. Whether or not this is a must try is totally up to you, but don't expect to be greeted and waited with a smile."
2,"Finally some southern food on this side of town! M&M was my go-to place for soul food but its actually too far from me. This place is a good substitution. Like the other people have said, the meat loaf is the thing to order here. One bite of this and you'll be transported to fluffy meat loaf smothered gravy heaven! (does it exist? YES!) Thing to stay away from were the ribs. I think there were only 3-4 ribs and they were covered in so much sauce it made it difficult to eat. The smothered chicken was quite good also with large pieces of chicken and lots of savory gravy. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Mainly because the portion size did not match the price. This is geared towards the ribs and the meat loaf. Even though they do come with sides, the main reason why I ordered the entree was to get the entree.... and not the sides.... so I expect a larger portion. Other than that, this is a good place for some good southern food."
4,"We had dinner here as we watched the Fountains of the Bellagio show.\nI had the french onion soup which was fabulous, and we also ordered artesan cheese hors d'oeuvres. We have not gotten around to having a full meal there yet. We will soon visit the Chicago location to try their steaks.\nThe ambience was warm and comfortable and the waitress was friendly and talkative (which I love). She actually told us about the Chicago location , which i did not know about and that they are part of the Lettuce Entertain You chain that I love many of their restaurants.\nThis particular location is perfect for travelers who want to eat a great meal and watch the Bellagio show."
3,It is a nice local coffee shop. I would suggest Jackson's Java before mentioning any of the national coffee shops. Always full of college people and even more so on poetry nights. The deserts are good. There are not many places in the University area where you can sit down and have a cup of coffee and a slice of cake.
4,Visited again and it didn't miss a beat from the last visit. Tried a few new items and they didn't disappoint either. Coconut creme pie is a must try! Can't go wrong with a drunk meal at dupars at 5 in the morning. Great service too!!!
3,Chipotle is one of the chain restaurants I like. It's better than Moes in my opinion. I always get the barbacoa burrito. It fills me up. Outdoor seating is nice. I flick the begging birdies grains of rice and it makes them happy.
3,Delicous burger. Size was a bit smaller but every bite is heaven. French fries was awesome as well. The ambient is top notch. \n\nI ordered a few rum and cokes and they were real strong - must for being $10/piece.
0,"So, let's get a few things sorted out first.  This show has been changed twice, totaling 3 different shows, my review is of the latest show.  For the record, Le R\u00eave is NOT a Cirque du Soleil show.  Let me repeat this, Le R\u00eave is NOT a Cirque du Soleil production.  Yes Cirque currently has 7 productions in Las Vegas, but this is NOT one of them.\n\nI feel a few too many people have had their hand in the artistic development of this production which is why it has become such a snore. Believe me, I tried... I tried to enjoy it, but it was lacking in many areas.\n\nShows such as these are indeed about the acts, but the details are what add to the character and enjoyment of such performance.  For instance, in the current production, a guy and girl and seemingly on a date at the beginning.  The guy kneels down and the girl turns around while he's whisked off the stage.  As the turns around, he's gone.  The acts and performances are what seem to be her thoughts during those critical moments of her being with him or not.  At the end, when he's brought back in, he is kneeling on the wrong knee!  Such a subtle change ruins the flow and realness of the performance.  I may be overly critical, but true artists know the vision of a production and ascertain such small details are solid.\n\nAs for the actual performances, most were decent and visually appealing, but there were issues with them.  For instance, the dancers, although choreographed together, were not solid as a unit.  Having one person slightly off can be undetected, but not 20-40% of the group.  The synchronized swimming was one area this was noticeable, which by the way there were too many swimmers to make the act even look nice.\n\nThe other aspect of the performance is that there are small side-acts taking place that are completely distracting for the main act.  Cirque knows how to pull this off with many things going on, yet the audience knows where to look and when.  I missed part of a breath-taking high dive because I was looking at some actor doing headstands...  Le R\u00eave completely misses this mark.\n\nHaving Dragone's background and experience at Cirque du Soleil from 1985 to 1999 is what convinced me to see Le R\u00eave, but it seems as if Wynn himself has had too much of a hand in this show and has degraded what could be a great performance piece.  Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone."
2,"Decent. Service is a little better than most dim sum places, but that's not saying much. The food is just okay. The fried rice is probably the best compared to other local dim sum places."
0,fast talkers try to cover up closing fees that they call something different. the gym is filthy. the gym is always overcrowded. if you can not afford a decent gym maybe it's for you. but watch out for the hidden fees. also when you leave the gym take a decontamination shower.
1,Food is ok the usual for Denny's but this one you need to look at the dishes. Almost every dish had dried food on them.
2,"This place was a good reminder of what a great all-the-fixings dog can be.  And of how much Chicago rocks!  My problem was that they put sweet peppers on their dogs -- not exactly abnormal, I know -- and they burst like a bouncing betty mine all over me every time I bit into a hot dog!  Just a whole mess of vinegar and madness.  So... skip those.  Otherwise, it's an okay dog combo, especially for the prices!"
0,"i like this place, but i won't rate it highly until the accept credit/debit.  it's 2010 folks, no one carries cash anymore.  don't inconvenience me and make me have to run to an ATM just to give you money."
2,"I went here on Monday with a couple friends to use a deal I had bought. I thought this bar was just ok. When we entered we noticed it was really warm in the bar, like warmer than it was outside...which is pretty bad considering we live in Phoenix....We had a decent amount of money to spend, so we got a lot of food. The waitress (and bartender) was nice enough, but seemed a little upset that we were using a deal. Also, it was kind of strange because while we were there she spilled something on herself so her solution was to take her shirt off and walk around in her bra....and she kept talking about how naked she felt....it was pretty awkward. We tried: The hot chick, fried zuc, chicken fingers and fries, cheese crisp, and a grilled cheese. It was a lot of fried food. Anyway, the hot chick was recommended by the waitress, but in all of our opinions, it was straight up bad.... it had a really weird flavor that I can't explain. Also, I asked for mine with mayo on the side, but it was slathered all over it. All of the food was pretty meh, nothing special, especially considering they claim to use a lot of fresh and local ingredients. The cheese crisp was probably the best item of the night. I probably would not come back here to eat, but I might come back to drink! They had a lot of beers and their happy hour specials looked good."
2,Interesting place inside. We had mimosas and breakfast before exploring the Science Center. No complaints.
1,"This was the first time I've tried Port Of Subs and the experience wasn't what I expected - the morning crew needs to work on their Customer Service!!!! \n\nMy husband and I came in while we waited for our Starbucks drink to be made. We both ordered Breakfast paninis the team member making our panini (I don't remember his name i threw away the receipt)  seem bothered while he was creating the sandwich... My husband asked if he can add the Avocado Spread to his panini and he verbatim said \""are you going to add Avocado to a breakfast panini??!\"" An shook his head... I'm sorry, but it's not the team members choice to add/take away anything on a sandwich their there to satisfy and go above and beyond for their customers... \n\nAfter this experience I won't be coming in Again!!!"
0,"If the crime maps and the ghetto bird roaming at night don't scare you away from midtown, hopefully this review will. Here is my list of crazyness I experienced at the infamous Midtown on Main. \n\n1. GHETTO ASS NEIGHBORS: \n(a) Across from our apartment lived a couple who enjoyed having parties monday-thursday. On the weekdays when people with jobs were asleep, these people would be out on their balcony talking extremely loud. No joke, they always invited another couple who ALWAYS got into a fight. From midnight to 3:30 in the morning we'd hear the couple fight. The man would call her a dumb bitch, an effing c*nt... you name it, he said it. Then he'd leave and you'd hear the woman crying about how it's the last time and she's done putting up with his sh*t. Ok the first time I heard it, it was sad. But every week? really? No respect for herself or the neighbors!\n\n(b) To the left of us lived a woman who hung out in her pajamas all day and loved yelling and cussing at her kids. This woman's kids were out of control.... they'd play video games late at night and turn the volume on full blast. They'd shoot airsoft guns at night or honk a blow horn. It was non stop with these kids and it was always super late at night. They were out of control. The dad of this household was missing for a while ( we assume he was locked up)... one night when my husband went to check the mail, he saw the woman making out with some dude at the playground who wasn't her babies daddy!! sketchy sketchy. \n\n(c) We lived above these girls who we're disgusting. They would take out their trash and leave it at their door for several days!!! They'd had 4-5 bags sitting outside their door in the heat! The smell was awful. If they decided to throw out the garbage, they'd drag the bags and garbage would be all over the stairs. Sometimes they would leave the bags of garbage at the bottom of the stairs! It was so confusing! Like are you planning on having someone else throw that away for you? \n\n(d) There was a random lady who would walk through the complex pushing a shopping cart and crying. Crying really loud. One night, not sure if it was her, but I woke up to someone walking through the complex crying and moaning super loud. Can you say creepy? \n\n(e) Our car got vandalized. \n\nOK still not convinced this place is terrible?\n\n(2) INCOMPETENT STAFF: \n(a) After our first month living here, we got a notice on our door that we owed over $50 because they gave us the wrong rate. Apparently, the girl who we signed our lease with made a mistake. Um, pretty sure you can just randomly decide that our rent is higher. We signed a contract. We refused and they said ok.\n\n(b) Our pool key had difficulty opening the gates to the only 2 pools they decided to keep open. (btw pools are never heated). Sometimes it would take 3-4 people to figure out the gates because everyone's keys didn't work! One lady told me to demand a new key because the office staff was reluctant to give her a new one. I decided to go one day and ask one of the guy's in the office and he kept questioning me like I was lying to him! He kept saying \""really? your key isn't working? I bet you it will work for me\"". OK guy, do you want to accompany me every time I go to the pool? I honestly don't understand why they were so hesitant to give people new keys. \n\n(c) One of the maintenance guys is a fricken prick.  One time my husband went to pick up a package that was sent to me, and when the girl went to get the package, the maintenance guy questioned my husband and asked \""is she even on the lease?\"". Um what? who are you? Another time they had left a note on everyone's doors saying that everyone had to take down their patio shades and request an approved shade from the office. After receiving this notice, my husband spoke to the office staff TWICE and inquired about the shade. We were told that they had put in a request for a shade for us, and would notify us when one became available. While we waited for our new shade, we received a threat of eviction because we weren't using one of their patio shades! My husband went into the office upset at the threat and the maintenance guy jumps in and basically tells my husband he shouldn't be upset because everyone received a notice about the patio shade. UM okay, again, who are you? The girl in the office apologized for the notice and took out the eviction threat from our file. \n\nLASTLY, upon moving out, the manager refused the do a walk through with us. Somehow whenever we were available, no one in the office was. They did the walk through without us and we got charged for a crack in the mirror that was already there when we moved in! LAME. If you still decide to live here, make sure you always make a copy of your rent checks and watch out for bugs. We were clean, but bugs loved popping up everywhere. Also beware of the train that comes right by the complex and blows its horn at 3 in the morning. well, good luck."
0,"Microwaved bun , no snap to the casing of the Vienna dog because it sat around in the steamer too long, French Fries barely warm and soggy   If this place was in my home town of Chicago , they would be out of business and run out of town in less than a week!!  Shame on you guys. Hey Everybody. This is NOT the taste of Chicago"
1,"I've been here twice for service and both times, the staff have been extremely rude.  I now drive out of my way to Henderson just for dealership services."
4,Pulled pork sliders. FTW and 2$ off on Mondays - how can you beat that?  The service was awesome and the food was incredible ... How come it took me so long to try this place out??  Should have taken Mike F's advice sooner and gone out here (thanks Mike)\n\nWife loved it and so did my son.  I will be back for sure to try other things on the menu.  So glad I found this place. (with the help of my fellow yelpers that is)
4,Very knowledgeable!! No magic cards though :(. Not very hard to find (if you look At the sign). They have a nice 1960s 1$ section!!
2,"The repairmen was lacking in experience. I had to point out a couple things that were unacceptable to me,that he would have let slide if I had not been standing there. When he was putting the unit back into place. They did respond quickly to my call"
2,"Well...it was good.  Probably not something you want to hear from a $60/entree place.  The guys we met there criticized me for making a judgment in relation to price, but I'm sorry, for $200 per person, I believe a qualifier is valid.\n\nThere's no question that the food was good, but I definitely wasn't falling off my bar stool without a purse hook under the bar.  Our server was very friendly and helpful, as I was completely undecided in what I wanted to get.  He told us that he would give us the 6 most favorite small plates on the menu.  I even clarified that I didn't want the most popular (I wanted to be a little more adventurous), but the 6 best.  He guaranteed me that he was on it.\n\nThe amuse bouche of foie gras with parmesan foam was delicious and I settled in for a great meal.  The first two dishes that came out were the mediterranean vegetables and the langoustine.  Both solid, but, in my opinion, unoriginal.  The second two were the foie gras sliders and the oysters.  Again, solid, but boring.  The final two were the quail and the veal cheek.  You know how it goes...\n\nI was disappointed that the sweetbreads was not included, so I ordered it.  It was probably the best of the dishes, but not spectacular.  In fact, the highlight of my meal was the salty, delicious cheese that my neighbor didn't like and gave to me.  I know that sounds a little creepy, but that cheese was worth every bite!  I wish I knew what it was.\n\nI'm not sure what made Joel Robuchon the chef of the century, but I pretty much did a tour of the restaurants in MGM this week and this one was by far the most disappointing.  The food was worse at Wolfgang Puck, but I paid 4x the price at this one.  Maybe being chef of the century has made this place lazy, but it's clear that you're paying for the name over the experience."
4,"My wife and I ate dinner here last weekend for our 28th anniversary. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable, and personable. \n\nOur food was outstanding! For appetizers we had Oysters Rockefeller & Mushrooms. We both had fillet Mignon's and I had a lobster tail all of which were outstanding. Our steaks could have been cut with our forks; tender and well seasoned. \n\nTheir wine list is extensive and the entire experience was over the top. \n\nWe were even comp'd dessert for our anniversary. \n\nThe dinner, no alcohol, was $150+ tip. While pricey, very well worth it."
3,"The Love Boat is loaded with so much fresh proteins (sashimi, nigiri, and rolls) that it made 3 of us completely satisfied. I also ordered seaweed salad as an appetizer - really good, I love the salad so much.\n\nNot entirely the best sushi in the world, but I'd say it's the best in Madison. Authenticity aside, the ingredients are fresh, and service is not bad, either."
4,"I had dinner here for the grand opening night. Considering it was the first official day of their opening, service and food was excellent. The waitstaff was friendly and made sure drinks were always full. The burgers themselves are a little smaller than average for a gourmet burger but very delicious. All items are la carte so make sure you order some fries. The truffle parmesan fries are great with their dipping sauces. The highlight of my meal was the strawberry shake with coconut pudding. It's is the most expensive shake I have ordered ($8) but it was also the best shake I have had. The shakes are a must. I would come back again."
4,"Another Charlotte favorite is Salsarita's... specifically for the shrimp burrito. I don't know of another fast food/quick food burrito place that offers shrimp. Do you? If so, post a reply and let me know asap! Although the line was crazy long and slow... granted it was a weekday around lunchtime, the food was good and inexpensive. I'm a Chipotle girl all day but again... for a shrimp burrito... two thumbs up for Salsarita's."
4,Everything we imagined and more. What a homey place to eat and chat and feel at home while away from the massive snow storm 2009 in DC.
1,"Perfectly adequate as a gas and convenience store frequented by neighborhood commuters and students from the nearby high school.  It's a little dirty, and they recently removed those neat advertising TVs from the pumps, so pumping gas is less entertaining here than it used to be.\n\nbut here's the thing....\n\nPump N Munch is a *superbly clever* name for a gas station / convenience store!  Bravo on that, if it's their own, novel idea.\n(shmoogle shows another store in Lansing, Michigan with that same name -- since i'm too lazy to investigate further, it becomes a chicken and egg paradox, as to who had it first or whether they're related in any way)\n\nHowever, having the slogan on your employees' tshirts be such a stolen and uninspired piece of drivel as \""What Happens at Pump N Much Stays at Pump N Munch\"" is simply inexcusable.  \n\nC'mon, that's the best you could do?\n\nIt might as well say \""Got Gas?\"" on the other side.  \n\n(I bet if they see this, they'll say, \""Great idea!\"" and print those tshirts up, pronto)\n\nHmmm, the one in Lansing, MI is even called \""Dick's Pump & Munch\"", so I'm going to have to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI'm not even sure I could do any better, but let's try:::::::\n\nI don't know, maybe, \""Pump N Munch - Satisfying ALL Your Cravings\""\n\n\""Your Neighborhood *Service* Station winkwink\""\n\nOr how about something like, \""in a recent customer poll, most men prefer to Munch, then Pump, while most women prefer no Pumping at all\""\n\nAddendum _\nThis place charges a premium price to buy gas on credit or even your debit card.  This is sadly more common lately, but at least at the Valero's they waive the extra fee if you use their own gas station charge card.  Even using a Shell card, PnM doesn't give you the cash discount.  Big Fail since that means I'll not be buying gas here unless it's some dire emergency.\nHere's one, \""Pump N Munch - Getting Our Dirty Hands in Your Pockets Since 1996\""\n\n8^ {"
4,Amazing! Top 2 Sundaes- 1. Buster Brownie and 2. Dusty Road Sundae. You won't want anything else! :)
4,"I'm a guy. I used to pay $8 for hair cuts or get them for free from a friend. Most cuts probably made me look like Lloyd Christmas.\nA few years ago I started to change the way I think about hair and started shelling out $25. I got a great cut and I kept going back.\nLast year I got a recomendation to see Jason at Salon 42 and because the person I used to go to was booked solid for month, I went.\n\nI pretty much told Jason that he came highly recomended so do whatever and if it sucked, my hair would grow back and I just wouldn't come back. However, Jason still took the challenge. He did an incredible job and I got more compliments than ever on my hair (something I never really pay attention to on other guys) from both men and women. One problem I have with my hair is that as it gets longer, it begins to curl at the edges. Also, while I have a full head of hair, the back grows more rapidly than the top and front (probably due to all that East TN water I used to drink). Whatever Jason does, he gives me a great cut the day of, but it now seems to grow much more even so now my entire head can have a party or be combed for business at the same time. I can choose!\n\nI have continued to go back every few months when the hair gets too shaggy and Jason not only remembers who I am but remembers what we last talked about. It makes it easy to have conversation and catch up while getting a top notch haircut.\n\nYou can tell this is not a job for Jason but an actual passion. He and his wife have been opening up other locations recently and it is easy to see why they are so successful.\nI've heard girls get a great style and cut there but speaking as a guy, I highly recomend it for men's cuts."
3,"This place was pretty cool.  I went here with some girlfriends in September for a bachelorette party, and we had a great time - the best place to get your groove on is on the roof next to Tao Beach.  The night before we went here, we tried to go here with all of our significant others, but two of the guys weren't wearing the proper shoes so it was a no go.  I'm secretly (er, I guess not so secretly since I'm yelping it) glad that we decided not to go with the guys after all, because it was more fun just us gals.  And the go go girls were hot.\n\nForgot to add that I'm still recovering from the restrooms.  On the second level, along the balcony overlooking the dance floor, is a line of individual restrooms that look out onto the dance area.  What makes these restrooms different is the fact that the doors to the individual restrooms are clear when unlocked and when you lock the door, it frosts over to give you privacy.  For the first time in my life I got pee shy because I could see the shadows of people walking along the balcony just beyond the door, and I was absolutely convinced that they could see me peeing (ok I was a bit tipsy by this point, because I'm sure the door was opaque enough to give me some privacy, but it's still a little nerve-racking)."
3,"i have been coming here for a conference for 7 years.  The rooms are terrific, the staff are amazing, it has a great restaurant - the Terrace room and a Starbucks.  \nThe hotel has played host to presidential hopefuls like John F Kennedy - the staff have better details and are glad to share their stories.  Many of the people that work here have been here forever and they can tell the stories first hand.\nI would have given it a 5 but they could not get my heat going the last time i was there - there climate control systems are a little antiquated so i froze my butt off - less than 55 in the room.\nIf you like classic older - full of character hotels this is the place to be.  Style and class are everywhere."
3,"After visiting a tea farm in mainland China, I learned there is not only a difference with taste but also on how the teas level of enhancing your health varies from standard quality all the way to high quality. \n\nSure, the prices are very high, but the quality of tea is actually of a better quality than what you would find elsewhere (if your tea comes in a tin from Dilmah or Republic of Tea, you know what I mean). And if your only purchases of tea are from Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Twinings, or Bigelow you will gasp and be totally shocked at the prices. \n\nWhat I really like is how they have taken the concept of blending teas to create several sensational teas that are so much more robust then the teas separately. It's this artful blending of teas that also demand the higher tea price. So, if you are looking for a good quality tea to drink at home at your leisure, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a tea blend to your liking. But if you just want tea for a one time use, better going to the store and buying a bottle of Tazo. \n\nI've sampled several of the teas, both hot and cold, and all are very good. They use a German rock sugar for some of the teas they sample. But even without the rock sugar the teas are really good. And if you do want the sugar, you can use an alternative like pure cane sugar that is cheaper but is just as good. And if you don't have an air & light tight container, they have a few sizes that are reusable. \n\nLastly, if the prices are still too high to swallow (no pun intended), I've been told they have sales every once in a while. I'll be looking out for those sales!"
0,made a reservation with this suck @&& airline through Orbiz few months ago but they keep  changeing my flights in n out without given any notice and we called talk to them few hours and they lie about the flights said it  was cancel but we check online it was NOt. They're BAD really bAD do not fly with them ever again.......Beware
2,"Don't get me wrong, steiner's is one of my favorite places but, the \""hashed browns\"" served this morning were horrible!  It was like a paste that was smeared onto the griddle & cooked.  So sad"
4,Great food and great service! Super friendly staff and delicious food every visit so far.
4,"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I love the wine shop, the food, the atmosphere, the evenings with live music, and the Saturday free wine tastings. This is my oasis in the desert. Just sitting out on the patio with a glass of wine looking out over the water makes me forget all my worries. I also love that the menu changes seasonally, providing me with exciting new choices (although there are times when I really miss some dishes but have to wait to have them again, like the short ribs in the winter -- delicious!). This is also a really great place for lunch if you're not on a strict schedule. Such tastiness should not be rushed!"
0,"The front counter lady sneezing without covering up should have been the only sign I needed, but I had already handed her my card to pay for the food. When we received the food, it was good, not great AND my husband and I had to pay the price for it for a whole week after, if you know what I mean. I say nay! Never again!"
2,"It used to be my go to store for everything from food, school supplies, cleaning supplies and all other stuff because it was large and open 24-hours. Now it's open kind of late and no more deli or frozen food section. \n\nTo be honest, it sure bets the hell out of going to wal-mart (because it's a zoo at any time of the day or night) but still is not as great as target."
2,"Triple 7 Microbrewery serves its purpose in DTLV.\n\nI stopped in while in the area for a power lunch with a coworker that lives in the area before my return to OC last week and although the old school kitchy Vegas look was welcoming, the food was rather underwhelming. The menu is expansive and I think that the kitchen is running by the \""Jack of all trades, master of none\"" mantra. I decided the San Fransisco Burger was the safest bet after some considerable consideration. \n\nA Beef Patty is Charbroiled and then mated with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Lettuce, a house sauce and toasted Sourdough. They nailed the temperature and all of the ingredients were of good if not great quality. With that said, it was a little boring if not an all out yawn. A mediocre burger in a fun environment nets a 3 star review all day, everyday."
4,"Want an A/C or heating repair done right? Multiple options presented to you if you need a new unit?  Then I highly recommend CHA.  \n\nA couple years ago we had a broken unit, another company came in (after making us wait), did not fix the problem and were surly on top of it.  Then we called Cruz at CHA. He was VERY fast to respond, and was able to get us going again. It was so nice to work with someone who was professional and personable. And his prices were competitive, easily beating out the competition.\n\nIn addition, when an old air conditioning unit needed replacing, Cruz provided several options, different models, prices, and explained in terms we could understand the differences between the units, energy performance, warranties, etc.  It made making our decision about which unit to select so much easier.  And again, everything happened fast.  Price check? His quote easily beat anyone else's.\n\nHe does duct replacement, and unit maintenance as well.  \n\nCHA is saved in my phone, and it will be the first call I make if I have any A/C or heating unit issues in the future."
3,This place is so neat! The Tuna Steak sandwich is fantastic and the cold brew coffee is a tasty treat to energize you! The store also has lots of nifty little gifts that you can't say no to buying.
1,"It's a bar...like the movie Coyote Ugly.  Girls dancing, pouring shots...other random girls from the floor get pulled up on stage to dance.  It's a bar...it's Vegas.  What do you expect...\n\nYea, it's fun...don't get me wrong.  You can dance, kinda..."
4,"I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with Dr. Kerry and his dental practice. He has a beautiful office, that's right off the 101 Hwy on Warner road. I was greeted with friendly smiles, and a very happy front desk person, Raydine.  Going to the dentist can be scary and no fun, but this office removes all your fears. I highly recommend them."
3,"I know it's a chain, but I am definitely a fan of the Chang's.  Located at Phillips Place near SouthPark Mall, it serves as a central meeting place for lunch with the girls that come from the far corners of the Charlotte area and has consistently good service and food.  \n\nMeeting a girlfriend here for lunch today, we were both starving when we got there and couldn't wait to dig in.  My dining companion started off with the Salt & Pepper Calamari, which I did not have any of, but it appeared to be well prepared, and must have been good because she ate it all (it's not a huge portion).\n\nTheir lunch items are served with either a cup of soup or a salad.  I chose the egg drop soup - it is so good here.  Light, with a good broth, with whisps of eggs rather than big ole globs.  Served with fried crispy strip things (you know what I am talking about) that were light and fresh.  For my entree I ordered the Mongolian Beef, which I LOVE.  That is my all-time favorite dish and I almost always order it (I am boring, once I find what I like, I stick with it, lest I order something else and be pissed if I don't like it).  It is served with white or brown rice or for $1 more, fried rice.  The beef was tender, well cooked and all nice-sized quality pieces of beef.\n\nFor dessert (I told ya... I was starving... and I knew my dinner tonight was going to be a $.20 package of ramen noodles) I ordered the Banana Spring Rolls which are pretty much bananas wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, fried and then served with coconut-pineapple ice cream and drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauces.  Light-ish and quite good.  Different.\n\nService was very good, as it generally is whenever I go to PF Chang's.  For lunch, a drink and dessert, it was $22, which is more than I usually pay for lunch, but it was quite good and a nice afternoon with a good friend."
1,Have dined at numerous Thai restaurants and am a huge fan of thai food. Must say that the food here was average. Not a whole lot of choice. What ticked me off was when I found other meat when I had asked for chicken. Ambiance was very ordinary. Waitresses were polite though...
2,Not bad tonight
0,"Dishonesty appears to be ingrained in the management/owners at Villa Peru. We tried to use a Voice Daily deal that was worth $20 toward the bill. They refused to accept it and offered 15% off instead. After repeatedly showing them the daily deal with the name of the restaurant and the 2/28/14 expiration clearly displayed they handed us a cell phone saying it was the \""manager.\"" This person also refused to honor the deal. \n\nThe table in front of us also appeared to have an issue with their experience. The chef/owner came out to talk to them and from what I overheard, it seemed that he was explaining that what they ordered was, in fact, the half chicken and not a quarter chicken as they'd wondered due to a missing wing, thigh, etc. \n\nFrom reading numerous reviews subsequently it would seem that the promotions thing has been an ongoing issue for months. It's a shame that, ourselves included, so many have fallen victim to the old bait-and-switch. \n\nWhen the bill arrived they had failed to apply the discount. I brought this to the server's attention and he took the bill back to apply it. When the bill was returned they'd actually added a dollar onto the cost of one of the items we ordered. The seco de carne is $12.50 on their menu, both in person and on the website, and it was $12.50 on the first bill that was brought out pre-discount. Post discount, it was $13.50.\n\nPhotos of both the Voice Daily deal and the discounted receipt have been uploaded.\n\nIt really is unfortunate because I'd been here twice before and had nothing to complain about. However, after the latest visit it's blatantly obvious that Villa Peru's primary concern is cheating the consumer. I would encourage anyone that reads this to avoid them. Such business practices should not be tolerated and any establishment such as this does not deserve to exist."
0,"Oh boy,  what a disappointment! We got a special from travelzoo. Now I know why it was a special! You get what you pay for!\n\nThis place is privately owned and operated by a management co.  Don't expect to have valet, room service, a working television in the bedroom, & water in the vending machines. Do expect to have hard beds with bed bugs!!\n\nIf you like mediocre lodging then this place is for you!"
2,"Oh, Natt Spil, you're a fun place to hang out at. You've got wonderful cocktails and delicious infused vodka.\n\nYour food? Well, that's pretty good, too.\n\nBut when one of your waiters decides to take food away when we're clearly not finished eating? Well, that's going to cause you a loss of two stars. And, I might add, a decline in tip percentage.\n\nThree stars, easily could've been 4+. Service takes a nasty toll, though. Tsk tsk."
2,"Server was pleasant, food was good, and we plan to return for the lamb shank."
4,"I don't know who does the hiring at Park Ave but whoever it  is certainly knows what they are doing.  The staff here is really young but they are service oriented.  I wish I could find more places with the attitude they have here.\n\nThe prices are low, the cleaning is done well, and if there is any question they will redo the garment.\n\nThey keep the price low is by taking cash and checks.  Don't expect to use a credit card.\n\nThere isn't a lot of parking so you may have to park in the parking lots on both sides of the building.  Never hurts to burn a few calories.\n\nI have been using these people for so many years that I really don't remember...maybe 30?  Nice place to do business with.  I worked in retail for many years.  Most of the major stores I worked in, this is where the majority employees took their dry cleaning  Work clothes had to last, so if you wanted things done right, you went here for a price one could afford."
3,"Great new brewery in Tempe.  This place isn't much to look at (just lot's of concrete and a large number of TVs), but it does serve good beer at good prices and is a great place to watch sports.  \n\nAnother thing is that since it just recently opened, it is somewhat of an unknown gem.  On multiple nights we have gone there and played apples to apples with the staff for a free beer.  It's nice to get away from the Tempe crowds sometimes and go to a place where they remember you.\n\nAs others have said in reviews, there is no actual menu but I like being able to order from other places.  I also love the free popcorn and pretzel mix every time I go in there.\n\nTry all of their beers and they also have an 8 beer sampler which is a great way to do so.  Keep our new brewery thriving and get your friends in there for some drinks."
2,"Mimi's Cafe, was different in its own way, but only OK. We did go during lunch time, so I did expect it to be slow going. \n\nLocated in Henderson, off Sunset and Stephanie lies a nice looking restaurant called Mimi's Cafe. It had vibrant color on the outside, the setting inside feels more like a log cabin setting. Which was nice and warm feeling. The waiting area even had tables to sit at and menus to see what they had. It took about 10 minutes for us to be seated. Looking around the place, it was very well decorated. It had plenty of room to move around. The booth did have covers, where you don't have to be looking at the other people behind you or behind your eating partner and seeing other people stuffing their faces. \n\nThe staff so far is good, I did like the greeter as well as the person who sat us. We were greeted by our waiter who did took our drink, but he spoke softly, which was kind of hard to hear. Later on, we had a waitress who was training another waitress. I guess for training purpose, that they had to switch the waiter we had to begin with, to the waitress who was training the other waitress. Which was odd, but I'm sure they had their reasons. \n\nSince it was the first time we been here, we were taking a while to go over the menu. Some things did look good, but didn't really excite me or stuck out as much. We did started off with the Asian appetizer, which consist of Coconut covered shrimp, Chicken Tenders and Pot Stickers. That was really good, we even ate the cole slaw that was part of it. The wife got a cheeseburger, I got a classic beef dip sandwich. Presentation was good overall, the taste was fulfilling and I did like majority of it. \n\nOverall, if you are in the area, this might be a good place. I would suggest, not during the busy times. Of course I don't like going during the busy time, but we really didn't have a choice, it was just the time we happen to be in the area. But overall, it is a decent place to go eat."
1,"More like 2.5 stars.  This place is ok.  Nothing special.  A bit pricey.  \n\nWent here with my cousin and a bunch of friends on one of many Vegas trips.  My cousin was super excited because she had seen it on Rachel Ray.  I've never watched Rachel Ray, but if this is the kind of place she recommends, then I cannot trust her opinion.\n\nThis was another one of those \""it's more about saying you've been there, rather than the food\"" type of places.  A lot of things on the menu sounded great.  \n got the Chicken Enchilada Omelet.  It was ok.\nI forgot what my girlfriend ordered, but it sounded fantastic on the menu.  It was ok.\nMy friend ordered pork chops and eggs.  Looked great.  He said it was ok.\nMy cousin and her hubby ordered whatever it was that Rachel Ray had ordered.  She was spouting off about how great it was, but honestly, it didn't even look that good.  Her enthusiasm seemed forced.\nThe other members of our party weren't very pleased with their breakfasts either.\n\nThis place is only open until 2 pm.  So you better get there early.  Don't worry about me holding up your table though, because I won't be back.  I'll be at Blueberry Hill, on Flamingo Rd., enjoying a very good breakfast for about half the price."
0,"No sea food soup..Noddles in soup super thick, hard to eat. Over prized. I orderer soup and veggie tempura, bill was $30 exclude tip. Sushi and sashimi okay. But nothing special. Super small, tables are for groups."
3,"Of all the Station Casino Buffets this is by far the best. While no one likes to admit they like the buffets, I do. Not because I can gorge my myself but because I have a hard time making a decision on what I want when I go out. Here, I can get a bite of a few different things and I love it! And if you hate it? Don't eat it and go try something else. \n\nThe sushi station is usually really good, and I love the Mexican options. The dessert selections leave much to be desired. But maybe that's better for a fattie  like me. Ha. \n\nOops I meant foodie... Or did I?\n\nThe brunch is great, simply because who doesn't like bottomless mimosas? Happy Sunday! \n\nI've eaten here quite a few times and I would come back. Of course I eat here free, so why wouldn't I? \n\nIf you're in the area, def give it a try. You'll surely find something you like."
0,This store focuses on store policies than customer service.
2,"This was exactly what I was expecting.  Typical Gastropub with trendy decor.  I started off with a Bacon Bloody Mary, which was my absolute favorite part of the meal (haha).  The smoky flavor was present, but not overwhelming.  I could have had 3, except for the fact that it was pretty darn strong.  For $10 a pop, I enjoyed that it had a little kick to it.  \n\nI ordered a chicken sandwich because our waiter told us that all the bread was house made and raved about the sandwiches.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  My two brunch partners got salad, which they said were very tasty.  \n\nIf you're staying at the Hard Rock, I'd definitely give this place a try.  It offers something a little different from the steakhouses and sushi bars."
2,"Lately, the food has been hit or miss. Tonight we had some really bad service and the situation was not helped by the manager. I understand that everyone has a bad night, but the customer should not suffer! At least our food was good tonight."
0,"I'll take my business to FedEx or the USPS after my experiences with UPS stores.\n\nThey are expensive, lack decent customer service, manager is rude and micromanages the staff.  Hello, if they can't do the task without your \""help\"" maybe you shouldn't have hired them or maybe you need to alter your training program.\nWe have gone here merely for the convenience of the location(s) and have had to take business elsewhere for various reasons (purchasing stamps, mailing packages, etc.)\nMost recent visit, I arrived with a fax to send but a third customer that came in had hers sent first instead of waiting for mine.Had to wait for transmission receipt before they could send a new fax.   Business where my fax was being sent closed during the wait for the other customers fax and mine never went through.  Thanks for that.\nI have got to remember to stop going there."
3,"I came here on a Friday night with family to try out their Hibachi cooking since it's near by.  I've been to other near by Japanese Hibachi style restaurants, but I have to say that Ohjah kicked some butt and is at the top of my list.  The salad dressing was delicious and the entire meal was yummy.  I especially enjoyed the Udon noodles and the fresh vegetables.  I was not a huge fan of their onion soup; it was a bit salty and the breaded onion pieces inside looked like it came from a can of crispy onions.  All and all the service was great and the chef preparing our meal was hilarious and very entertaining.  It is a good size restaurant with a private room for dining.  The decor is nice and it has a great vibe.  I hope this plays sticks around because I will definitely be back to try their sushi bar and other menu items."
4,"Yeah, I'm a dude, but I know my fair share of brands, even when it comes to purses.  You can thank my Filipino Mom and Aunties for not cutting themselves short by settling for the knock offs and instead dragging my ass, kicking and screaming to the real stores but the end result of me getting a toy or Happy Meal.  This has been going on for 25+ years and still happens to this day, less the Happy Meal...darn!\n\nAnyhow, I was with the cousin during a recent visit and she was set on getting a Chanel purse.  She said that the staff at the stores up in the Bay Area are so snobby, which I will agree.  Little do they know that my little cousin makes just under $200k a year, so proud of her!  \n\nWe walked in and I am so sorry that I forgot her name but, were were immediately greeted but one of the sales associates, I believe she was Chinese.  She was definitely not either of the two Filipino women associates, who must've been from the Bay because they both looked us up and down as we walked in.  Our associate was very helpful and didn't hound over us or pressure us at all.  She insured that we had a pleasant shopping experience, which we did.  \n\nIn the end, the cousin ended up with a purse worth more than two of my paychecks but, probably change in the ashtray for the cousin. ;)"
3,"I went for Sunday Seafood Brunch. It's $35, but with crabs and unlimited beer and wine I think it is worth it. \n\nI am biased here, but I liked the Asian style crabs here. Nice flavoring and not overpowering or salty. \n\nThe raw oysters are pretty decent. I wouldn't go for sushi here. Instead I would go to Goyemon. ( I went to 3 buffets while in Vegas for 2 days practically..) \n\nDessert selection is great. They have different flavored macaroons, tiramisu, etc. To be honest I was soo full I could barely have dessert. I did manage to stuff a creme brulee down and it was good. They have the nice sugar coating on top and its creamy. \n\nThe unlimited beer and wine is awesome. I had a mimosa, red wine, and some cider. The cider is delicious. It's pink and I think it has a hint of raspberry in it. Reminds me of Wyder Cider, although Wyder Cider is better. But its unlimited here and I'm not going to complain."
2,"Friendly staff, good prices, decent portions. Ambiance is lacking and the few times I've eaten here the food has ranged from average to good-not great. For the price though, I'm a repeat customer, especially given my positive experience with the staff."
2,"As soon as I walked in to the dining area, I noticed how stuffy the place was and why -- the windows don't open! Lucky for us, we were able to get a table on the patio for lunch.\n\nOnce sat, it took far too long to even get acknowledged by the server. So minus one star for that.\n \nMy burger was pretty good, but only because the beef in it was outstanding and perfectly cooked. The lack of even the most basic accouterments; e.g. pickle, tomato, and lettuce, though left it pretty underwhelming. When I grill burgers at my house or even at a tailgate, they're better dressed than this PB&J of burgers. Minus one star."
0,"Waste of time and money. This place has terrible customer service, long waits, untrained staff with a huge turnover rate,  understaffed during busy times so makes waits unacceptably long, spray tans are always broken and I don't know how many times I have had to come out of the room and ask them to set the bed - after I've already prepared to tan....and the list goes on and on.  There is never any compensation when the  VersaSpa is broken- which is every other day, so you basically pay for something that isn't available. Customer service lacks immensely. After giving them several chances, I finally cancelled it.  Go to LA Tan- much better service and management."
0,"I've been to Bluephies many, many times.  What kept me going back was the food - it is pretty damn good.  The prices are CRAZY, though - this is a DINER in MADISON not Aix en Provence. \n\nUnfortunately, the service is TERRIBLE!!!  \n\nDuring one visit, the patrons at the table next to us started changing their baby's diaper on the TABLE - the wait staff was unable to intervene - so my husband and I had to say something.  Who wants to see a baby's ass during dinner? not to speak of air-borne illnesses landing in our food ~ 3 feet away."
1,"I might give it one more try.  The service was fast, the sandwich was relatively good but could have been more flavorable considering the price point of this restaurant.  Then came the food with a bag of plain lays Potato chips.  I think Subway offer more flavor for less money.  On the upside the coleslaw had an interesting twist with the feta cheese.  They could have cut it up better, looked like a shake out of the bag job.  Don't go out of your way to eat here."
4,"Do you want me to have nightmares forever? Because after running screaming through a field of masked characters with chainsaws, I think I'm scarred for life! This haunted house is huge with a creepy corn maze, old abandoned town with haunted cathedral, a crashed alien spaceship and clowns in a mad house! NO, THANK YOU! I'm terrified of clowns! So next time I need to bring more friends to protect me or go through the kiddie corn maze! No doubt, Fear Farm is the scariest place in Arizona!"
1,"I've only been here twice, I gave it another chance, but the food is just not good. The service is average, but the dishes that I have tried here were very bland and just something you can get from the frozen aisle at the grocery store. Not coming back, to any location."
4,"Three words: Spicy Cajun Meatloaf.\n\nSuper fast, friendly service at a reasonable price. Tried the meatloaf and chicken fried steak. Both were excellent. Definitely going back."
0,"So we stayed at Tropicana and decided to go to Bagatelle one of the days we were there... it was pretty cool, they had a couple fun blow-up water slides and I liked how they had some shade. However, the staff needs to get it together. The bartender told us one thing, and the waitress/head lady working there told us another. When we got home from our Vegas trip, we checked our accounts and Bagatelle over charged us by $350, so ridiculous! We called and they did an investigation and eventually refunded me the money... until 2 weeks later when I checked my credit card statement and they RE-CHARGED me that money! I emailed the guy who originally handled the problem and am waiting to hear back... worst customer service EVER. Don't go here unless you want to pay way more than expected."
1,To be honest our stay here was so awful maybe I was a bit jaded by the time we had lunch here. We got to the buffet for lunch at 11 AM when it was supposed to start. Didn't have a long wait in line and we seated quickly. When going up most the serving stations were either empty or sill had breakfast items which is fine they are switching over. They have a pretty good chicken fried steak for breakfast I admit. Service to get drinks and plates cleared was pretty spotty considering at the time it was just my husband and I and two other tables in the section. After about half an hour to 45 minutes they finally had lunch started but only the Asian station and a meat station not many sides available and the taco bar was still empty as was the salad bar. The carved turkey was decent but my husbands prime rib was tough and way to rare. It was a so so buffet but at least it was comped I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on what I saw and ate
2,"How does one really rate serialized mediocrity? Seriously.\n\nCall me jaded by the marinade of Dr. Hogly Wogly and honest to god real backyard Que, but the factory Que here is just like a Denny's, in other words where you go if you don't want to risk success or failure, but just eat, a lot.\n\nThe best thing was their sides, but to be honest the \""Creamy Slaw\"" was a carbon copy of KFC's. Does anybody know if they are the same chain? If so, that question is answered. It was not bad, in fact one of the reasons I do stop at KFC is the slaw. The potato salad was nice with the potatoes cooked completely and other veggies nice and crisp. Even the mac and cheese was great. However...\n\nSides are great, but Famous Dave's is a Que place so what counts is the meat. First off I had the brisket (like I've said, I am a beef guy) and my wife the baby backs. There are 5 different sauces to choose from, mild to \""oh my god that was supposed to be spicy but fell so far short that it can be chugged.\"" No risk with the BBQ Sauces. The meat was indeed smoked, not sure with what, it was something other than an aged hard wood, I could taste some of the sap or something chemical you get from either softer woods or wood not completely aged and dried. The brisket was hot and moist when served, but dried on the plate and became mealy. Sauce could not help this. They did better with the baby backs, but then again, how can you not, the cut is so fatty in the first place. The only way to screw it up is to vastly over cook or grossly under cook. There is a huge \""done\"" range for baby back ribs; they are forgiving. So I had a couple of those bones (see, I do not turn up my nose at the pig) and found they were just like everyone else's, read that Chili's and say Tony Roma's. Please note I am comparing chains here because as far as I know there is no chain in the world that pulls off superior Que.\n\nNow we get to things like service and atmosphere. Our server was over every 3 minutes, is everything okay? So will you be back? And so on. It was annoying and as a matter of fact, no I won't be you over eager twit! To say I was annoyed is an understatement. I had my watch out, she literally stopped by every 3 to 5 minutes. Talk about desperate. I normally tip about 30% or more because I know a good tip can make your night, but sorry, good old standard 10% for you, I just couldn't open my wallet that wide is was chaffed from all the inquiries as to when I would be spending more there. The d\u00e9cor was cookie cutter, as if they have done it about a thousand times (which I guess they have) and while comfortable did not impress.\n\nOver all this place should get about a 2 1/2 stars from me, but since I can't give a half star I will be generous and round up to a simple 3 stars since I recognize that some people are going to love it. But believe me you can make better Que on your Weber at home any day of the week.\n\nThis will not make my \""Cheers Spots\"" but will make my \""BBQ search list\"" since it is Que after all, sort of."
1,"So I'm a typical dumb american who's been to New York several times and then drives by Ray's and says \""HOLY CRAP, THERE'S A RAY'S PIZZA HERE!!!!!!\"" \n\nNo. \n\nEpic fail dumb American, See \""copying business practices\"" in business ethics book.\n\nI understand that Ray's Pizza in NYC is for the most part independent but,I'm not that impressed with \""Rays Pizza\"" in AZ, I'm just....not.\n\nI don't know if I'm getting my hopes up too high everytime I  pull up to the place or, if I'm just going when my pizza palate isn't at it's peak.\n\nEither way, both times I've gone, I mean yeah I'm satisfied and all but a part of me says, Meh, I've had better. \n\nThe slices out front look delicious but just IMO fail to deliver the extraordinary cheese, greasy meats and crispy/chewy crust that all come with the NY pizza dining experience.\n\nI guess it's okay, I just feel you can get a better slice from NYPD pizza or Joe's in old town."
3,"I first experiened Bravo Restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas.  Thank you for coming to Blakeney off Rea Road.  Finally a decent restaurant in this space. The only draw back is finding a parking place at Blakeney.  The food is delicious and offers a variety for your cuisine.  I have found the service to be slow and this coud because it is new or inexperienced waitresses.  It is a beautiful restaurant.  Ask for a table outside.  Make a reservation in advance if going on Friday or Saturday -- they are busy.  A fan."
1,"There wasn't anything spectacular about this place at all. They had a sign  up on the wall Maxim Magazine voted them one of the best bars in the country a few years back.  Maybe it was super cool a few years ago, but as for now, I beg to differ.  The hostess asked if we would be eating, and we told her yes.  She then told us to grab a seat anywhere we'd like.  We sit, and another woman rushes over and tells us nobody is serving that section.  Strange, since the place isn't huge. But anyway.. we sit elsewhere and she comes over and asks if we would be eating.  Yes. Then she made some rude, unnecessary comment about the hostess forgetting to give us menus.  We ordered our drinks and decided to go with the appetizer sampler.  It was about $22 and came with a few different appetizers.  Honestly, all were bad.  I understand that most bar food is fried food.. but c'mon.  This stuff was literally drenched.   You could taste the oil which was so unappetizing.  My weird husband must have been starving because he said it was alright.  I deemed everything inedible and let him have the rest.  For a drink, I opted for the amaretto sour.  The sweetest, weakest $8 amaretto sour in the world.  It strangely tasted like cherry kool-aid.  What's up with that!? I never really read Maxim Magazine before, but after this.. I don't think they can be trusted."
2,"A good late night spot to get some food before passing out drunk. I thought I had my swerve on until I looked to my left and watched a guy try and stay awake, barely keeping his head up, almost drowning in his bowl of noodles. \n\nHad a simple bowl of wonton noodle soup to get some liquid besides alcohol in the body before sleeping. Pretty decent food overall.\n\nNot cheap. But neither is vegas. Service puts up with a lot crap. They serve drunks that would be rejected just about anywhere else. So if you can barely stand up, try this place."
1,"2.5 stars.  I stopped in here on a whim during my walk home last night, and I really hadn't heard anything about it.  I was initially underwhelmed.  Somehow I thought the name Brgr was in homage to the city of Pittsburgh. I wasn't really in the mood for a Burger, and there simply isn't anything else on the menu except a $9 cobb salad and $6 chili.  I had the chili, it was quite tasty, but nothing too unseen.  Beer prices are expensive for Pittsburgh, rail drinks are more respectable.  The saving grace was my friendly service.\n\nBut PLEASE, for the love of pete, if you are going to charge $4 for a Yuengling and $9-25 for a burger with no sides you can afford to hire a graphic designer for your logo!"
3,Yeah a solid burger and fries joint - some tasty looking milkshake options too if you happen to want to bump your meal up another thousand calories. Got a slightly tweaked bacon guacamole burger with the bottomless fries (awesome!) and would go again to try another variation (and sweet pot fries this time..)
3,"This is one of my Montreal favourites folks.  \n\nIt's a fabulous British pub just a few steps from Atwater market and the Lachine Canal.  Fun food, fun atmosphere and great pub drinks with a very imaginative cocktail menu that changes to suit the occasion or season.   \n\nThey got this place right!  But it can be tough to find a seat if there is a special event or occasion to celebrate. \n\nIf you are antiquing in the ridiculously priced shops on Notre Dame, or perusing the Atwater market or hanging by the canal...this is a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner."
4,"The most important part of Basset Street Brunch Club: I have waited my entire life for a server at a restaurant to ask me, \""Interested in donuts to start?\"" YES. Always.\n\nJokes aside, though, I really enjoyed Bassett Street Brunch Club. My friend and I had a 15-20 minute wait, which was totally fine for Sunday brunch time (11:30). Our server was very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was fun - I didn't completely \""get\"" the robot decor, but I think I like it.\n\nFirst, the drinks: my friend had a bloody mary, which she said was just okay. I loved that they have horchata, and as a Rumchata lover, the spike horchata was a good choice.\n\nThe food was also awesome. I started with a chocolate glazed donut with crushed hazelnuts on top (Nutella donut, anyone?). My friend ordered a peanut butter glazed one with Corn Pops on top. Both were very good, but having lived near Greenbush Bakery for a year, I can't honestly say Bassett has the best donuts I've ever tasted.\n\nAfter the donut course (I can't believe I just got to say that), I ordered the Mac Attack, which was a generous bowl of pasta shells with cheese sauce, shredded parmesan, green onion, kale, and butternut squash. For me, this was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nI liked everything about Bassett Street Brunch Club, and I can't wait to try more of their donuts, but I'm really excited to check out the rest of their savory entrees."
2,"I've been taking my car to Showcase for service for a while. They seem to do a pretty good job. The staff is extremely friendly, and if you go online before your visit, there's almost always a coupon posted. \n\nMy only complaint is their estimated time it'll take them to do the work. I go in for an oil change. They say it should only take an hour, it seems to always take at least an hour and a half. Make sure you have a good book or something (I usually go down the street to LA Fitness for a work out). Because if they find anything else wrong with your car it's going to be a long day."
3,"If you're vegetarian, this is the place for you. But I do have to wonder if the food is really not meat, cause it tastes just like it.\n\nA huge selection of choices...I have to say me fav was General Tao. \n\nGive it a go...you'll be happy you did!"
4,This is my favorite nail spot. \nThe actual store is beautiful and exceptionally clean. \nWhoever designed it truly understood aesthetics. \n\nI love their different pedicure options... The mocha smells amazing. \nThe stone massage is so relaxing. \n\nThey also do waxing and I have been so happy with my results. \n\nLooking forward to getting a facial next week.
1,"I went to this place based on the yelp reviews- I needed a haircut and haven't really been able to find a stylist or salon that I was truly happy with. I'm currently in the process of growing out my pixie cut, and it's in the awkward stage of growing out over the ears and just isn't flattering. I could tell right away the stylist wasn't very knowledgable with shorter styles with lots of layers (lots of layers is kind of a side effect of a pixie) and she really didn't impress me. The sides and back that I wanted trimmed up are super choppy and not flattering.  I have really thick hair that is big and frizzy, and since she didn't thin it out it just made it look really fluffy. The way she styled it was adding more volume and no flat iron, so the style was almost wavy and weird and I couldn't tell how choppy the cut was until I got home and fixed the style. The people there seemed nice and maybe I would have liked my experience if my hair was more uniform, but with the results I got I won't be back."
2,"The big chicken pot pie is huge here! It pretty good actually...\n\nThis place is a good place to share your food... we came here with 8 people and ordered like 5 dishes and everyone was full... The service kinda sucked, the prices are alright, it's good if you split it up with everyone..."
4,"Happy Father's Day!  I got to pick today (it is always a joint decision anyway ;-) and selected this location because it was close to a theatre we were going to.  Upon entering, the first thing you notice is the striking multiple red globes hanging from the ceiling--a very modernistically decorated and beautiful surprise in a restaurant that is part of a strip mall (although a very classy strip mall.)  Our server Chris was young and attentive, and made a few recommendations for us.  We both ordered a starter for a change.  My wife got the edamame wontons (I looked up the correct pronunciation, as a former Japanese language student, and FYI it is ed-AH-mah-may, accent on the second syllable--not ed-ah-MAH-may as Chris and others have prounounced.)  These were five fried won tons wrapped around a mixture of edamame beans, cheese and onions, and they were very different and we were glad we tried them.  I ordered the lobster spring rolls as a huge lobster fan, and there were four of these and they were very tasty as well.  For our entrees we shared the king crab roll, which was very fresh and delicious, and the lobster shrimp roll, which was also very good.  Both were accompanied by a wasabi sauce but I was disappointed that there was not a lot of heat to it.  They were two of the more expensive items on the menu, but the price justified the content.  The meal was made perfect with each of us having a 22 oz. Kirin Ichiban beer to wash it all down.  Manager Mike came by and even offered us free ice cream (reason for the fifth star!), but we were just too stuffed and needed to get to our matinee.  This is a good choice for a rather upscale sushi experience."
4,"Great to just come here and pass the time sometimes, get some work done and read some books."
3,"Yes ...the first time I stopped in ,I ordered the half rack of ribs and I must admit they were finger lick'n good....My second time I took a date ....Now they use Ipod phones to place your order which is cool....unless the system goes down, now I must say they were on it realized the problem and took care of our order ....Made up for the wait by giving us free dessert ....They also offer \""Live Entertainment\"" which is a plus ....So you can enjoy the best of both worlds and you won't  brake the bank....We will go back and tell our friends"
1,"This is just for service - Didn't even get to try the food here!\n\nI was excited to try this place during an impromptu Vegas trip. Called for Reservations a week ahead and they called me the day off to confirm. I told them we were running 15 min late and they said it might take longer to seat us.\n\nWe ended up waiting 30 minutes before we gave up and left since we had a show to get to. I don't think pushing the reservations 15 back should have made that much of a dramatic wait difference - isn't the point of a reservation is to HOLD the table for me? Whats the diff between holding it 15min in the beginning than if i took an extra 15 min to eat/sit there?  Anyways, as we were waiting at the bar, another couple had  reservation as well and they were waiting longer than we were and also getting fed up.What's weird was there was a decent amount of empty tables so it wasn't like very table was filled to capacity. \n\nDon't think I'll attempt to eat at this place, whats the point of reservations if you have to wait?"
1,Went back the next day it wasn't worth the wait..Rib tips were just fat..couldn't chew it away..most of it ended up in my napkin.  It was seasoned pretty well and sides were decent
0,The customer service at this particular Walgreens is horrendous - from both the checkout counter to the pharmacy.  Never have I experienced such a lackluster attitude towards customers.  I'm generally a fan of Walgreens but I will drive the extra mile to avoid this particular Walgreens.
3,"I have been to Cheuvront a couple of times, but this time was my first actual meal here. I had just finished a big exam and really needed a glass of wine.\nMel had the open faced Tuna Steak sandwich, wich was beautiful but a little difficult to eat. Thick slices of avocado and thin slices of sear ahi tuna on a ciabatta roll. She said it was delicious.\nI ordered the Grilled Cheddar Cheese. It was exactly what I wanted- melty, cheesy, and sublime. I paired it with a glass of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, which I reccomend. It's a fruity but crisp white and it really hit the spot.\nThis is a great date spot. This is the place to go for a new wine suggestion. I'll be back soon."
1,"Went to Mother Nature's Farm last week with a group of 12-13 yr olds. This place is definitely geared for children 6 and under. The kids were bored out of their minds within ten minutes. It was a lot smaller than I expected, and I thought the $10 entry fee was a little much for what you get. I did think the staff was friendly, except for the guy that drove the tractor around for the hayride. He didn't say anything to us, instead he jumped on the tractor and listened to his ipod as he drove us around. If you have young children, they might enjoy this place. If they are any older than 6 or 7, I would not recommend it."
3,"Been here once and had a great experience.  I had a dessert crepe that was well prepared and abundant in chocolate, nutella, strawberries, nuts and fresh whip!  Crepe was perfectly thin, fluffy and delicate.  The filling was intense!  Exactly what i was looking for a Saturday brunch, paired with a cup of french pressed coffee.  Divine!  \n\nGotta go again and try some of the savory crepes.  To be continued.....  ;)"
0,"I love Brazilian steakhouses. Ive been to several of them in las vegas, and a few around the country. Ive heard nothing but good things about fogo de chao, so ive been excited to try them out and compare. ive had to drop people off  numerous times there and it smells delicious. Where i work, there is also managers and other people who work there that come in and visit my work and they are always pleasant and always offering my co workers and i specials.\n\nSo why 1 star? Well the truth is I've never got to chance to eat there. Ive tried to make reservations 4 times, and I've also walked in once....each time being unsuccessful. \n\nNow I understand this place is very popular and gets busy, but why do i get shafted? I make a reservation, show up early, wait, im looking around and the place is half empty. I ask the people up front, why am i waiting so long? She replies that there are other reservations and that we will have to wait a bit longer. After 30 minutes and still not have been seated, I left. Why should i be punished when others who are running late get treated better than me. Oh and by the way this has happened TWICE. \n\nMy other two reservations attempts were denied because they were \""too busy and many people had already made reservations before i called\"". \n\nAnd of course my one walk in was a disaster. I pull in because the parking lot looked very empty. I walk in sure enough more tables available than I've ever seen. I enquire about eating and was told the wait would be 3.5 hours. There was a private party there that evening. Ok i thought, but the lady told me the party started a little over an hour after I enquired and there were tables available in the section that was not blocked off. Whatever\n\n Im sure this place is awesome, but I've thought about writing this place off for good. Ive only visited again because my girlfriend wanted to try again.  Is my business not worthy to them??"
2,"My boyfriend had one of his cravings for some Sonoran hotdogs, I'm not a fan of hot dogs AT ALL.. But it was one of those compromise while in a relationship moments so I played nice and went along. They do have a lot of food to choose from besides the hotdogs and I tried a chicken taco as well as a pork torta and both were pretty decent. \n\nI can't speak on behalf of the hotdogs but the smile on his face while slumped on the couch with his hand on his belly was a good enough indication that he was very happy and enjoyed them."
3,Very nice new hotel is Chandler we decided to stay here because we had our puppy lola and allot of the other hotels would not allow dogs.. The staff here is very friendly and jumped at the chance if we needed anything... My only complaint was that we had to keep asking for towels..
4,"I've been coming to Kimi for a while, my lashes are always perfect and I get a lot of compliments! Everyone asks me where I got em done. She's the best!"
3,"Finally decided to try the famous leeks at FnB. Ok, let me back up a moment. The restaurant is tiny! After speaking with the hostess once we got there, I learned that the only way we got a reservation on the same Friday evening I called was that someone canceled. Luck was on our side. \nWe ordered a few small plates: the leeks, the brussel sprouts, and the falafel. My husband ordered a SunBrew which the runner brought out in the can, with the glass and poured for him. I kind of liked that. I ordered a gin cocktail, the name escapes me, which seemed VERY light on the gin. no good, don't skimp a lady on her cocktail.\nMy favorite was the falafel for its' crunchy-on-the-outside-creamy-on-the-inside texture, which our server boasted were made to order. The leaks with homemade mozzarella and fried egg were fantastic. Although I agree with my husband, they were more cheesy, than....leeky. I'm not complaining though, as it is blasphemous to say anything has too much cheese. This is not possible. My first experience with brussel sprouts was a positive one, though I didn't much care for the warm grapes that accompanied them. \nA couple things on service.....our server was very nice and  explained the menu well. However he never once returned after we received out plates to check in if everything was ok. I also got a strange feeling that we weren't \""ordering enough\"" for him. Three small plates, two cocktails, I mean we don't eat meat and there was only one fish entree on the menu anyways. Maybe it was just me, but that's what brought my rating down to four stars."
3,"We got 2 rooms for 5 guys.  The rooms are very spacious and nicely appointed.  My only complaint is that on one of the sofas, there was a nasty mystery stain.  Other than that, I was very satisfied.  \n\nThe pool at Palazzo is very chill on a Friday.  I noticed a lot of families with young children.  They need more cocktail servers, I saw only 2 working the entire area so we had to go to the bar to get drinks.  \n\nOn Sat, we woke up too late to get a cabana at Tao Beach so we opted for Azure, which is Palazzo's version of TB.  We got a cabana with a pretty sweet location in between the two pools in Azure.  The minimum for the cabana was $750.  Bottles are less expensive at Azure then they are at the clubs so we were able to get 2 Greygoose and plenty of food.  What I remembered tasting good was Azure's lobster salad, cheeseburger and salmon pizza.  Service was excellent.  Estelle was there and sang a couple of songs so that was cool and they had a modeling show.  The crowd at Azure was good but more tamed than Tao Beach.  All in all, a very good experience."
4,"Popped in here after a visit to Sam's Club and honestly wasn't expecting much. Wow was I surprised! One of the better gyros I've had in a while, and one that rivals the late night vendors in Europe, but without the greasy feeling next morning. I tried the Chicken Gyro, but with tzatziki instead of honey dijon dressing. Absolutely delicious. The Greek Fries were yummy, though a little more cooked than I prefer. They offer free soup while you wait for your order. And the guys behind the counter were wonderfully nice and accommodating of everyone in the restaurant. You could definitely tell that they cared about making it an enjoyable dining experience for their customers. I know where I'll be going next time I have a hankering for some Greek food!"
0,"I don't like to give negative reviews but my husband ordered chicken and it was undercooked...TWICE! Service was good and they apologized but raw chicken to me is a major mishap. Upon leaving we noticed sewage seeping up from the drain outside and notified them about this unsanitary issue. Unfortunately, our visit there consisted of a combination of bad events. \n\nWe have not returned here to eat and I do not recommend it."
1,"I stopped in recently for lunch and was immediately disappointed when I spotted the drink cooler....another place that doesn't have a soda fountain.  Oh well, I'm here aren't I?\n\nHow about a gyro!  Yum!  My order took about 10 minutes and this gave me a chance to push the thought of baby sheep out of my mind so I could mentally prepare to really enjoy this hot and cool savory treat.  I thought that once you've had a gyro you've had them all.  Not so.  The Tzatziki sauce was off a little, not much cucumber taste and sort of a weird consistency.  The meat was rather bland, not what I am used to.  Most gyro shops feature meat by Kronos...this is why I think gyros are generally consistent from one place to the next.  I don't know what went wrong here but it wasn't quite right.  I didn't see where the meat came from but I'm guessing it wasn't on a rotating spit.  The pita, however, was good and I assume it was heated in the wood fired oven.  Finally, no lettuce :(\n\nAlso, as a heads up, the seating is very limited.  There is one table with 4 chairs and 4 other stools at the counter, that's it.\n\nI'll give it one more shot and try a pizza next time."
4,"Jawohl! This place is the bee's knees, the brat's tots, er...it's zehr gut. Mr. G fired up a tasty smoked brat that we later added to red beans and rice. Dang. That is no budget brat! The ladies behind the counter were very helpful and, because we bought a huge amount for a party, they even threw in a free box of orange liqueur chocolates for us!\n\nI inquired about a curious sign near the cash register that read \""Fresh Venison\"". Basically, if you're a local hunter and bring your deer in here, they'll do all the necessary butchering for you. Sometimes they have leftovers for customers to purchase. Sounds a little wild, but next time I might be game!\n\nOh, and ditto on the Haribo gummy candy selection. It's huge."
0,"One of my favorite restaurants in the past, just went with my family for the first time. \n\nWas told after I received my order and had asked for something else \""that I had ordered that\"". Waiter walks away. Charged for it and nothing was address. \n\nSuch an embarrassing situation I will never be going back."
3,Great view and food. Wheelchair accessible to boot. Definitely a must do romantic spot.
0,"I took my 4 year old son in for a haircut. When I left, his hair was still wet, and when it dried, it was completely uneven everywhere! Not to mention the fact that the girl used thinning shears on him and he said the haircut hurt! Not wanting to go back to the same girl, I called them and they told me to come at 10 in the morning and the manager would fix it. My husband took our son back at 10 am and was told that the manager was not there, but on her way. At 10:45, she still had not shown up and my husband finally left. I have had a couple of nice, professional hair cuts there, but the black woman with the gap in her teeth (I do not know her name) is terrible. IF you decide to take your chances here, avoid her at all costs!"
1,"Are you folks kidding? This casino is just a touch better than some of the places you would find in Atlantic City or Fremont Street. When I walked through, it felt like I was walking through a long narrow hallway. There aren't that many gaming tables at the Cosmo and most were empty. This place is perfect for the 20 something wannabe look at me fake money fake boobs crowd from LA. People with real money and real class are next door at Bellagio. I doubt I will ever gamble or stay here."
2,"I went to this place about 3 or 4 months ago and  I wouldn't have given it more than 2 stars. I had the BBQ chicken which was horrible, needless to say that I didn't eat it, the brisket was very dry, seemed like it was probably for 2 days old. (Not saying it was).\nA friend of mine was visiting from out of Town last Friday and wanted some BBQ, so with some trepidation I took him there. We ordered the brisket, and some BBQd chicken, and there was a remarkable difference. \nAs we dined, there was a live band playing, i don't know their name but they were pretty darn good. Anyway, as we ate a gentleman came over to our table to check on us, and asked how everything was. I was very candid with him as to my thoughts of the place during my first visit, and now. He indicated that he was a new manager and he was trying to change some things for the better, including the quality of the food, I never got his his name, but he has black hair and wears glasses, probably in his mid 40s, nice guy, very pleasant to us.\nI will definitely return, and if things continue to improve, I may even give this place 4 stars."
1,"I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.  They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!"
1,"Pros\n1. Nice glass selection - unlike Visionworks - they cary high fashion frames like Prada, Burberry, Versace, Polo, Gucci and Ray Ban\n2. Very organized in their process. They provide you with a lens case, where you select 4-5 frames. You try them on and they take a picture of you with all of them on. \n3. Fast- Their glasses are done in about an hour like they advertise\n\nCons\n1. Very salesy and they push for features that drive up the cost of the glasses.\n2. Insurance plan only covers the cheap lenses. The lenses that you want are very expensive and usually over a $100 by themselves not including the frames\n3. They push for a $35 service fee that is unnecessary in my opinion. It's similar to car rental companies charging for insurance when you already have coverage thru your insurance\n4. Understaffed - we had to wait a long time before someone helped us.\n5. They will push for you to buy a second pair of glasses for 40% off to suggest you are getting a deal when in reality the glasses are so marked up that 40% off $300 glasses isn't really a deal.\n\nBottomline- can be okay but just be prepared for the upselling. You don't need antireflective coating and other special lenses that your insurance plan doesn't cover. You don't need the repair plan.  You don't need a second pair of glasses. Be prepared to walk away."
4,The food here is amazing!  I work nearby and come here at least once a week.  Even if you're not adventurous enough to try some of their Mediterranean dishes they have the most amazing burger!
0,"Didn't try the food.  \n\nIn fact, I went as they had their grand opening with the thought of ordering food for the family.  As they are picky eaters, I looked at the menu.  The menu was not  as diverse as some, and knowing that some restaurants will special order food for you or modify a recipe, I asked if they could make something that was not on the menu.  Rather than saying they could not, the comment was made with a very rude tone, \""My chef is an authentic Chinese Chef and what you are ordering is not Chinese, but something made up for Americans.  He won't make that.\""  It wasn't what he said, but how he said it and with such disdain that I will never darken the doorstep of this restaurant again."
3,"The BT Cheeseburger is large and very tasty, certainly enough to fill you up without needing any sides.\nIf I'm ever in Charlotte again, this will definitely be on my list of places to visit."
0,"This has been the worst experience EVER!  The hotel was dirty with a roach crawling across our room.  Mold in the bath room.  To add insult to injury, they have charged us for 3 nights even though we only stayed 2. They acknowledge we were there for 2 and that we paid for 2 but the reservation was through Priceline and the dates were wrong so they were billing us an extra day - totally frustrating!  Don't bother.  The lack of Customer Service is appalling!  This experience has been the worst hotel stay I've ever had."
3,"Hip, trendy place that plays off the speakeasy theme. Located in South End, I've been over to this bar quite a few times now. I'm in love with the decor - sleek, modern text adorn the walls with quips and sayings in an artful way. Being a graphic designer, I appreciate an added touch of art! \n\nThe cocktails can run you about $10 a pop but you haven't truly experienced Stache House until you've sipped on one of their concoctions. Giving a nod to mustaches everywhere, the drinks are named according - The Tom Selleck, The Charlie Chaplin and others. The Chaplin is by far my favorite, although I haven't tried a wide variety since I never got past the Chaplin on my last visit. This tasty libation is light, fresh and goes down far too easily. Adorned with a lime wedge and a sprig of basil, this drink gets my vote. \n\nThe place is a bit small but with a cozy feel and a relaxing touch when the crew pulls open the garage door front on a nice day. On the weekends, you'll get a DJ and a shoulder-to-shoulder packed house. If that's your thing, perfect. If not, you'll definitely either want to avoid it or go early on. Great for groups to hang out and the variety of different stache styles that grace the windows are always good for a conversation starter."
3,"Love the ambiance at this nice little spot. Came with some friends for a little Sunday Funday. Eugene was our bartender and was awesome! They make fresh greyhounds, by fresh I mean fresh squeezed juice to order. Sooooo good! Drinks were good and food was too."
2,"Food was very good but \""the Perfect Matgarita\"" which was recommended by our waitress was the smallest, weakest and the most ice filled Margarita that i have EVER had and they charged $8.50.  Next time i will drink a beer."
2,"I had high expectations of this place since my co-workers raved about it so much. I finally had the chance to check this place out. Some highs, some lows.\n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. It's bright and inviting. The view outside the windows is awesome. I would think this place would be quite romantic at nighttime, with all the lights of the Strip beaming in. \n\nA buddy of mine was in town and wanted to go to the Cosmo for lunch. The three-course lunch menu for $20.12 won us over. Our server was a sweetheart and explained the menu thoroughly since it was our first time there. Needless to say, we were excited - grumbling tummies and all. \n\nMy first course was the lox and bagel. Dainty, yet satisfying. Nothing too exciting here,  though. My buddy and boyfriend both ordered the scallop skewers. These were really good - fresh, plump and juicy. \n\nI ordered the jumbo shrimp with couscous for my main course. This was very good. I loved the seasoning on the shrimp and the couscous was cooked to perfection. I wanted to lick my plate when I was done for some more. My boyfriend ordered the sea bass which was delicious as well. The sea bass was presented as a whole filet in which he was advised to eat from the tail up. My buddy ordered the salmon with a side of broccoli. I didn't get to taste this, but it looked alright. \n\nI was really disappointed in the desserts. My buddy and I ordered the walnut cake. The cake itself was really heavy and tasted like over-sweetened, heavy baklava. Don't get me wrong, I love baklava. But this cake was too much. On top of that, the cake had a spoonful of a ginger-type ice cream. This was terrible. I thought it tasted like fancy cardboard. My boyfriend got the fruit plate. Don't have much to say here because it was simply just a plateful of seasonal fruit. I saw that the people around us had some type of yogurt parfait. That looked tasty. I really wished I had gotten that instead of the walnut cake. \n\nPerhaps my expectations were too high for this place. But I'm willing to go back one of these days for dinner and try it again."
1,"The food continues to be great but it seem like there's a couple of the waitress that are getting to be a little snippy.  \n\nToday the wife went there with her regular cast of friends for breakfast and ordered the Greek Omelet but when her ordered arrived, it wasn't a Greek Omelet, it was a Feta Omelet and when she told the waitress she didn't order Feta, she waitress insisted that what she got was what she ordered and refused to correct it.  \n\nOn another occasion I ordered some eggs and told the waitress that what I really would like to have was over medium (yellow runny but the white cooked) but I had always had to order them well done because the cook can't seem to ever get it right (the white was ALWAYS runny).  She said that I should order them medium well but I told her that from my experience, over medium to the cook means over easy no matter how many chances I gave him.  Oh my, she was not happy that I said that!  From then on you could tell that she was forcing herself to come to the table to check on us.  \n\nSo, when I go, I just have to avoid those two waitresses."
1,"My 14 y.o. daughter and I met some friends here for lunch yesterday, and I would have to say that it was just OK. It wasn't bad at all, but for what we paid, it definitely wasn't anything special.\n\nI ordered the Cheeseburger Island Style which included grilled pineapple and Hawaiian Teriyaki sauce, neither of which had much flavor or added anything to the burger. I don't usually order cheese on my burger, but I went ahead with it, and I don't think it was a good quality cheese because it also did not have a distinct (or any, really) flavor. The bun was soggy and fell apart when I tried to eat it. My daughter ordered the Cheeseburger Babies (sliders, basically), and she seemed to like them, but when I asked her after the meal how they were, she said they were \""nothing special.\"" You have to order the sides separately, and we split an order of onion rings. They were a soggy crisp (I know, kind of an oxymoron), and had a strange flavor to them--I can't quite put my finger (or taste bud) on it. We ended up not finishing them, even between the two of us.\n\nService was just all right. I ordered a water and a Coke to drink, and only ever received the water. My daughter never got a refill on her lemonade. The people we were with also ordered the Babies, and they did not get the top buns for their burgers. They had to ask for them and the buns were brought out separately a few minutes later on a small plate. Kind of weird--buns are a pretty basic expectation with a burger.\n\nThe total for two burger entrees, a side of onion rings, and one soda was around $31.00. Not too bad for on the strip dining, but I think we would have been more satisfied with a less expensive burger and some delicious fried pickles from another chain burger restaurant. We will likely not return."
2,"The fried pickles were great, and the fries were so-so. I really wish the ownership never changed. From what i hear it is not the same as it used to be. Still i wont be too harsh on the ol' penguin. 3 stars for me"
4,"This is the place I make all my friends/family come to when they visit. The staff is wonderful, the atmosphere is hip, and there is a dish for everyone! (even people who do not like sushi)\n\nIf you do go I would recommend asking what the best things on menu since it can be a little difficult figuring out what to get for the first time. ;)"
1,"On the the upside, this restaurant has beautiful views and some interesting architecture (I like the ceiling a lot).  Unfortunately, probably because of the large open area and high ceiling, it does tend to get incredibly noisy when busy, and might be better for a small group, or preferably just two people, so that you can hear each other.  I was here for a friend's birthday, and there were eight of us.  It was difficult to chat with the people on the far side of the table without a lot of shouting.\n\nWe came here on a Wednesday during restaurant week.  Although the waitress was polite, the service was incredibly slow, especially for a Wednesday!  I believe we were there for 45 minutes before our food order was even taken. For restaurant week, you choose a salad (I got the T.O.R House Salad), entree (I chose the Composition of Local Farmer's Vegetables) and a desert.  I'm a vegetarian so that was really my only option for an entree.  The salad was good, especially the beets.  The entree was PATHETIC! Firstly, it was just a few (really only a few) basic small roasted vegetables, and a tiny bit of rice.  Something I could easily do at home much better.  Considering the high price, I would have expected some effort made in terms of interesting or expensive ingredients, and preferably some kind of protein.  The portion was tiny!  It was smaller than I would expect for a one person appetizer, never mind a main entree.  It was frustrating that everyone else was complaining that they almost had too much food, but despite being a very small female, I was not at all satiated.  Just because I'm a vegetarian, it does not mean I'm attempting to starve myself with small carrots, I still want to eat!!  Hopefully they will read this review, and do something to improve their vegetarian entree option, as it really is a beautiful spot.  My cocktail was tasty, no complaints there."
2,"Think New Jersey diner size menu, lots and lots of choices covering most major food groupings.  I had an LTO special called drunken chicken which had a pleasant creamy red sauce and was served over potato cakes.   Very generous in size and I enjoyed it.  We also tried the rib's which turned out to be very decent considering it is a chain restaurant with a broad menu.  Service was very good and the store had a good sized outdoor eating area.  Would certainly go again if in the area."
2,Ok food but they do have drink specials which gives it a higher rating.  Plus there is outdoor seating.
2,OK so I've read the reviews and I can't disagree but on the other hand I have to tell readers to remember why you are coming to MARGARITAVILLE...It's an experience people...You're not coming here for a meal because there is no where else to go...You're coming here because it's what it is...\n\nDrinks are good...I've had better\nFood is good...I've had better\nMusic is awesome...It's Buffett man cmon he is the best in concert I've seen him like ten times so coming to his restaurant is totally fun. \n\nWhen I come to Margaritaville I'm not coming to have a dining experience I usually come to show friends a fun time...visit the gift shop and listen to great music and watch the TV's. That is what MARGARITAVILLE is all about. If you want more than that it is going to disappoint.\n\nIf you want something really great though...The Nacho's will NOT disappoint they are yummy...
4,"We live around the corner and discovered the place about a year ago. The owner (Ben) is friendly and always makes it a point to say hello. We stick to the bagels and cream cheese which are warm, fresh and made locally. I recently brought a dozen bagels and cream cheese to work and my colleagues all wanted to know I bought them. This is a great neighborhood spot!"
3,"We came in around 2pm, pretty much dead so we received quick service and our sushi didn't wow us but it was good for the simplicity of what we ordered, if I could offer any advice please try the calamari! Very good. Nice little hang out, and if your not wanting a loss of breath bill ( for  all my fellow penny pinchers) go during happy hour!! \n\nP.s Just keep swimming"
2,"It's a DoubleTree Hotel, so you get free, warm cookies at check-in. Score to that!\n\nOther than that, the location being so close to State Street (about .3 miles) and having a warm indoor pool, it was just standard. I didn't find the hotel to be particularly amazing in any other way.\n\nWas the bed comfy? Sure.\nThe room spacious? Yeah.\nThe bathroom clean? Yup.\n\nBut nothing stood out as especially better than a Holiday Inn. And the construction with the hammering at 8 a.m.... was less than welcomed. I guess they have to do construction at some point... but of course it had to happen while we were there with our 1-year old for the night!\n\nWe'd stay there again, but wouldn't hesitate to consider our other options. \n\nParking: must pay, but it's upstairs and many of the spots are covered... so that's a nice touch."
1,"Don't take your clothes here if you don't smoke! The whole place wreaks of smoke. The first two times I took my clothes there, they did a great job and to my surprise, nothing smelled of smoke. They seem to be very good at alterations, when they remember to do them. Had to take a pair of pants back the next day, when I got them home and tried them on, they hadn't shorten them and they smelled of cigarette smoke. Took them back and this time they were ready the next day, but they smell so bad of smoke I didn't even want to try them on. I had to use an in-dryer dry cleaning sheet to dry clean them after picking them up from the dry cleaners! So stupid. I paid more than $9 to dry clean them myself. Will have to find someplace else. Wish they didn't smoke inside the store. It's on the ground floor right next to the parking lot. Why they can't go outside to smoke? Guess they figure they will just cater to smokers. Stupid. There really are people in Vegas who don't smoke."
0,"Despicable.  Tried to extort additional money to install tint on my car.\n\nCalled and discussed my vehicle in advance with the owner Ron.  Told him year, make and model (2003 BMW 3-series) and asked if it would be covered with the Groupon.  He said it would and made no mention of any \""specialty\"" charge.  I specifically asked about any premium charge related to the vehicle because of the quarter panel windows and was told there was no additional charge.  After receiving his reassurance, I purchased the Groupon and schedule my appointment for a month later.\n\nShowed up on the day of my appointment to have the tint installed and was told it would be an additional $100 to install tint because it is a specialty vehicle.  When I challenged the tint installer about this he said \""Hey man, this is not bait and switch\"".  I find it interesting that he chose to introduce that specific term into the conversation.  He then went to go get Ron.\n\nDuring the ensuing discussion with Ron, he denied having the conversation with me about my vehicle a month ago.  He told me that the reason for charging extra was 1)  My vehicle has a curved back window.  2)  BMW is a luxury vehicle 3)  He could tint 2 Toyota Corollas in the time it would take to tint my car.  4)  His business would lose money if he tinted my car for $129 ($299 value).  \n\nHe actually had the audacity to say that the price to tint my car without a Groupon would have easily been $399.  They also attempted to use fear-mongering tactics about how all other tint shops use inferior products and their tint would last.  \n\nUltimately, Ron had no interest in doing what it would take to make this right and honoring the verbal information he had previously provided me.  \n\nWhile I appreciate the position of a business to reserve the right to charge more for a particular vehicle at their discretion; I have serious issues with saying one thing on the phone and then trying to pull a fast one when the customer shows up for the install.  It's unfortunate that this happened as others have had positive experiences with this company.  My advice is to speak to the owner in advance and have him email you a price quote for your vehicle before purchasing any Groupons."
1,"My nails looked great, but not even a week after I had them they started breaking! I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary, the product just seems cheap to me."
4,The food was delicious and the beer was great!  Service was friendly and quick! Would come here again!
2,Yes free beer & wine all you can eat buffets where can you find :). The food was okay probably will not come back!
3,"I originally came in because a few of my friends wanted to have a relaxed night just drinking a couple of bottles of wine. We read that live jazz music was played regularly, and I looked forward to hearing some Rat Pack music, or possibly Miles Davis, BB King, or something of the like.\n\nWe stood outside for a few moments waiting for a few friends to join us. Inside we heard something a little louder and modern than we expected. It was low lit and still pretty loud when we stepped inside. We found a seat at a high table and waited for our server to come by.\n\nIt took several minutes, but our waitress made her way over and brought us a menu. The menu included food, desserts, and wine by the glass. We asked for a bottle menu, and she then handed us a large three ring binder.\n\nThe binder starts with white wines for the first few hundred pages, and then moves on to reds to finish out. The wine list is extensive and filled with a lot of interesting information. My only complaint with it is that all of the wine is separated by white/red, and then listed by price (Bottles listed from around $10-$300+ and even a $10,000 bottle of Bordeaux). There is absolutely no varietal menu.\n\nWe then relocated to a different spot of the bar to get a little further from the music, and were able to hear each other a little bit better. Our waitress came and found us, and then helped us pick a couple of bottles. She poured us a few glasses and talked with us a bit. The service was a little slow at the start but transitioned to a much more attentive and hands on style.\n\nThe wine was absolutely delicious, and the atmosphere (minus some of the music) was wonderful. The best thing they could do is to have some sort of varietal menu for the bottled wines.\n\nI will definitely be back again."
1,"Went to Ling & Louie's with a friend for dinner tonight to discuss upcoming photoshoots and design work. \nWe walked in and were greeted by the bartender, and then we waited to be seated for what seemed like forever. \nFinally the bartender ended up seating us and was very friendly, however, once again we waited, and waited, for a server to greet us.\nI have been in the service industry for well over 10yrs and this kind of treatment of customers is just completely inexcusable.\n I was glad I was in good company because otherwise I may have walked out.\nOnce we were greeted by a server, she didn't seem very personable or attentive to out needs or making sure that we were satisfied. She didn't really even seem to care that we were there or not.\nWe ordered appetizers and dinner. I was very pleased with the calamari that came with semi spicy sauce.\nI ordered the ahi tacos which were also amazing! \nI was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to try any dessert.\nIf It wasn't for the awesome food I would have only given one star. \nNot sure I would return unless it were just to hang out at the bar and only to be served by the sweet bartender."
3,"I heard of Elements on Shea through Arizona Spa Girls a while ago but had never been there before. When I was in dire need of a massage last night (around 4:30pm), I decided to call and see if they had any openings at all. When I called they were incredibly professional and kind and were able to fit both me and my boyfriend in for appointments at 7pm. So convenient and helpful!\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early to fill out some first-timer paperwork, and were very impressed immediately by the cleanliness and tranquility of this beautiful little shop. We both received 55-min. massages at the introductory $59 rate and were more than relaxed when we left. Definitely one of the best massages I've had in a while! \n\nWe'll definitely be back again soon!"
4,We have a new Sushi spot. Probably the best Sushi I've had in 10 years. I recommend the surf n turf roll!
2,"The Why:  Considered by some to be the inventor if \""new Qu\u00e9bec gastronomy\"" and bestowed with Five Diamonds, Relais et Chateaux recognition, and nearly twenty years at the top of Montreal's dining scene a meal at Toque seemed like a perfect prelude to dinner at Au Pied du Cochon.  Helmed by Normand Laprise and focused strongly on local sourcing with a daily menu meant to focus on items most fresh, unique, and dazzling from the local markets I will admit I'd heard some mixed feelings on recent visits to the restaurant, but with my mother and aunt planning to save room for what was sure to be a gluttonous evening the large formal dining room seemed like a perfect place to lunch amongst the city's well-heeled and well dressed.\n \n\nThe Space:  Large and spacious with high ceilings, soft wall coverings, blond wood, and plush carpet Toque feels very serious and aside from the large metal flower marker out front it certainly is a serious restaurant with widely set tables, servers speaking in whispers, and a wine cellar focused on Canada but inclusive of all the best - many visible on a floating rack in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe Service:  All female during my visit and all friendly, efficient, and professional.  Perfect posture, peerless pours, and plates delivered with ample description were the norm throughout my visit and ever-present but never looming there is no doubt the team here is well trained.  More Paris than New York I will say that I am generally more comfortable with servers who show a little more personality, but all things being equal it would be hard to find fault in the team at Toque.\n\nBread Service:  Served in a small box with an icy puck of bland butter a trio of breads featuring a Sourdough Roll, Carraway Rye slices, and Crostini arrived first - each was fine, but the butter was largely inedible until it had rested a good twenty minutes; a pet peeve of mine.\n\nQuinoa Salad, Squab Confit, Iceberg Lettuce, Dried Fruit:  I really don't know why I was being served iceberg lettuce in a fine dining space, but I have to say I appreciated the honesty as thin strings stood alongside razor thin radishes atop a truly impressive warm salad of toothsome quinoa, crisp and fatty squab, plus dried peaches, apricots, and plums.  A deft balance of sweet, savory, and nutty this was one of those dishes that far exceeded modest expectations handily.\n\nQuail Confit, Brandy Sauce, Eggplant Caviar, Garlic Puree, Cabbage, Parsnip and Beet Chips:  More fowl, and this one more substantial in portion, it would be hard to imagine a more juicy bird than the whole quail set before me.  Reportedly baked in duck fat for nearly half a day and plated with vegetables in varying forms, flavors, and texture the quail itself was perfect and each accoutrement helped lead the plate in a new direction, yet unfortunately where this dish came up short for me was in the sauce - a potent reduction that threatened to overwhelm nearly everything it touched.  As an added note - crispy cabbage leaves only seem like a good idea; in reality they shatter with even the slightest touch of a fork and would have been better served as finger food.\n\nWith coffee supplied by Illy I went with an Americano and oddly it was brought out before my cheese course - but cheers to the folks at Toque, the refills were free and thus I was able to enjoy a few cups, including one with dessert, rather than suffer cool coffee.\n\nRiopelle with Sweet Almonds, Apple Jelly, Onion Bread:  At $8 per selection the cheese board at Toque is well culled but largely international and wanting to try something local my server directed me to this - the best cheese of the trip without a doubt and seemingly uncommon in the world of Canadian cheeses in that it was quite soft, nearly liquid in the mouth.  Triple cream and intense on the first taste with a lot of fruity and earthy notes coming forth later I've since sought this out at home and also found the accoutrements to be superlative - who knew apple jam spread on onion bread could work so well?\n\nChurros, Chocolate, Coffee Sauce:  My fault.  I have no idea why I ordered this at a place like Toque other than the fact that the other dessert options did not sound very good either.  Overcooked, over-sugared, and although the coffee sauce was good the execution was not.  Again, I don't know why I ordered it or why it was on the menu.\n\nThe Verdict:  All things being equal I think I may have cheated myself by visiting Toque at lunch - a quick glance at the dinner menu all but confirms that, but considering their stature in the Canadian culinary landscape I guess I expected a bit more of a \""yes\"" attitude to something as simple as a cold foie gras prep at lunch - particularly as the restaurant was less than 1/8 full throughout my visit.  Great service, beautiful room, but aside from the quinoa salad and a cheese that can be bought elsewhere nothing truly 'wowed' me enough to say I'd go back or recommend it to others."
0,"Thieves!  Not content with the $130 they took from me for the car detail, they stole my $60 sun shade. Realized it was missing 10 days later, called them up and the woman who I spoke to took 2 seconds to say 'it's not here, I just checked the lost and found'. Never will I return there!"
3,After eating several other gyro place Kings still has the best sauce.
1,"super divey, even lower than filbertos.... good for college kids that need late night munchies but my husband got sick off the fish tacos... i guess when you are desperate and its the closest thing to you besides burger king it ok..."
3,"I eat here fairly regularly and have been doing so for years. It is not really what I would call pure authentic, but it is very good. I usually order the number 13 combo with taco, tostada, and a beef enchilada. The choriso breakfast burritos are really good also. This place is always very busy for lunch but we generally manage to get a table by the time our order is ready. If your going to do takeout call in your order so it will be ready when you get there.\nThis is THE place to go buy freshly made flour tortillas, you order them, they make them, and you get them nice and warm."
1,"Yet another restaurant I was forced to eat at during my brief visit to LV.\n\nA dining rule that has served me well is to try really hard not to eat at places that have \""Co.\"" in their name.\n\nOur group decided to dine here as it was convenient, we were in a bit of a time crunch, and we just needed a little sustenance prior to our evening event.\n\nIt was decorated in a really cheesy Asian theme, replete with a creepy floating baby head that gave me the willies because its eyes were following me.\n\nFood was subpar. I just wanted something small to tide me over so I ordered a won-ton soup. It was reminiscent of packaged supermarket stuff.  Really salty, yet bland.\n\nI didn't pay much attention to what everyone else ordered but no one was too happy with their choices. One of our group had ordered fried rice and the vegetables in it were still frozen. Just unacceptable.\n\nIn a city with many great dining options, I recommend you skip this craptastic food-court quality excuse for a restaurant."
1,"Wife and I came in for an early dinner. Server had limited knowledge of the menu and had to ask chef on at least 2 dishes. \n\nWife had BBQ pork and I had rib eye. BBQ pork and fries felt like they were microwaved. Rib eye was good but could have used simple salt and pepper for seasoning. Mashed potatoes were god awful and smelled like seafood, we didn't eat them. \n\nOverall I thought Rounders was 10x better and right down the street."
0,"After having 2 stellar meals on previous visits, we decided to head to Sumomaya at the last minute to ring in the New Year with one of their famous concoctions from the bar. After settling into our seats at the bar, my daughter was carded and, despite the fact that she is 22, they refused to serve her a drink because of her ID being \""vertical\"". She was humiliated and embarrassed. I understand the need for laws, especially when preventing under age drinking, but she is of legal drinking age..... And she was with her mother, for heaven's sake! It ruined what had been a wonderful evening, celebrating the New Year. The General Manager was completely inflexible, citing that the law was new ( he said it was instituted in Nov, when it was July) when we told him she had been served on our two previous visits. \n\nWe won't be back!"
4,A little treasure we found while wandering. Excellent food great drinks and wine. Everything well thought out. Loved it!
2,"So I seem to have a love-hate relationship with this place. At times I love it and at times I hate. Lately it's been the latter of the two unfortunately. Going here for food wasn't bad. In fact, it was delish, but going here and experiencing the night life has not been awesome as it once was. While it is in part due to the people that go here - a bunch of douchey guys and the girls that go with them (it is Old Town) - I can deal with them cause mixed in there are some cool people. What I can't deal with are some of the people working there, starting with the door guys who seem to relish the power and enjoy letting people know it. And if they weren't bad enough, let's get into the bartenders. \n\nI've known some bartenders and I did the whole bar tending thing and no where in all that I learned and know, did they mention giving people crap service. I get it, you're busy and you get slammed, but you get through it and they should want to take and make as many drinks as they can rather than being all selective and choosing certain people over others. I'm sorry, I don't want to swoon over the bartenders, I just want my drink. And, when they finally decide to deign me with their presence and place my order, they get it wrong. And trying to flag them back over after they hand you your bill to point out the mistake wasn't even worth trying since trying to get their attention the first time too a bit of work. \n\nThe servers were all right; haven't had anyone exceptional to rave or rant about. The music is usually pretty awesome. And as I've said, there are some pretty awesome people worth going back for, as well as their food. I do enjoy their happy hour menu.\nI just know that before going to El Hefe, I need to start out somewhere else if I want a drink and then head over, as is the usual plan when we go out."
4,"My husband and I got to experience this new steakhouse inside Bally's. The food was great!! We started with the spinach with bacon vignette salad. I was surprised with the flavors of the salad. The blue cheese added to the mixture of flavors. I am normally picky with meat but the filet mignon was so good. I recommend it, it was nice and tender with good flavors. The flavors got more intense with the horseradish sauce I ordered. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were average. Overall the setting and server service made the night. If you are around the Bally's casino, stop by BLT Steak. You wont be disappointed."
3,"First time visiting and it would probably fall between 3.5-4.\n\nCame with the fellas and we all enjoyed the food.  We had two of the seafood platter.  Good stuff but very over-priced for what you get.  But hey, this is Vegas, it's the Bellagio, and it's a place with trendy decor.\n\nNone of us had drinks as we were planning on getting drunk elsewhere. \n\nAfter the starter, we had dinner.  Most of us ordered the rib eye which was very good.  Someone had the braised short rib and said it was very good as well.  We ordered all the side dishes to try.\n\n-Potato croquettes were good.\n-deep fried/tempura asparagus...good.\n-another green dish, wasn't memorable because i can't even remember what it was.\n-fried rice....good\n\ngreat service, great atmosphere."
4,"Jason's Deli\n3910 S Maryland Parkway\nLas Vegas, NV 89119\n\nJason's Deli is one of my favorite casual restaurants in Las Vegas for three very important reasons: The food is top quality and the portions are huge for what you get-especially in sandwiches like the Rueben. I saw a family order the first time I came in, and the meat was about 5 inches thick; it made me do a double take!\n\nI had the bow-tie pasta with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and I am trying to remember all the other ingredients that went into it; it was delicate in flavor and delicious and the pasta was cooked al dente. Over the cooked pasta was melted mozzarella & Parmesan. I was told by the staff to pay the extra buck and get the full portion, as it was a way better value!\n\nThe staff is worth coming in for at the Jason's Deli on Maryland Parkway. The manager Joseph Martin is a fantastic person and loves the company and treats everybody like family. He makes it a joy to come in and a reason I don't even want to go to any other location. He told me what a joy it is to work for the company and how it is like one big family. He makes me feel right at home too.\n\nAlso Russell Day is always upbeat and happy and positive and if he gives the best service around with an infectious smile that cannot help but rub off on you.\nAndrew smiled and greeted me when I walked in the door and handed me a glass for my water, which was wonderful, and told me where the booth was with the plug end in it. Writers and computer people love booths with plugs!\n\nI moved from southern CA where The Corner Bakery and Panera rule and I have been to nearly all of them. If I had known there was a Jason's Deli-Jason's Deli blows both of them out of the water by the price and value and quality of the menu selections. Also, Jason's Deli allows you to buy half sandwiches, which is perfect for me.\nI don't know what was wrong with the people who were writing reviews on Yelp about this place, but I would say consider the source, before you take it to heart.\nI want to meet with the PR Director or General Manager and discuss a marketing plan that would tell the story behind this fantastic establishment. \n\nAll in all, I would say it is the one of the best values for the money, if you want some great homemade soup or a truly memorable sandwich. \n\nI saw one of the small pan pepperoni pizzas a family ordered, and I guess it is on the kid's menu, but it looked pretty damn good to me!\n\nPaulette Le Pore Motzko\nRestaurantShowCase.wordpress.com"
4,"This place is a must if you are a foodie and you are in Vegas.  We were in Vegas for a week and decided to find restaurants off the strip.  We were so happy to find this place and enjoyed everything they had to offer.  Poached egg with sea urchin was just amazing and enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon is delicious.  I really am impressed with the owner/chef who walks around checking and tasting some dishes with his chopsticks and spoon on his shoulder.  Scallop, fresh tofu, and even house sake tastes so great, my next visit to Vegas, I took my co-workers there.\n\nVery clean, great bathroom, atmosphere, and awesome desert, this place is a hidden gem in Vegas."
3,"Awesome hotel.  I live at Veer across the way and love it there.  Unfortunately there's a wind tunnel when winds are super strong and it makes things loud at Veer.  Our condo is awesome tho and will comp us at Vdara when it happens (this is 1st time in 8 months it's gotten super loud and it took winds of 60 mph - so no big deal ).\n\nCheckin (Tues at 3pm) was super easy and fast).  Requested high floor and she was happy to help even though I'm comped.  Quick ride up to 42nd floor to my suite.\n\nPros:\nYou're essentially getting a small condo i'd easily pay $50+ more for this vs a regular room at another 4 star property (MGM, etc)\nReally nice layout for 580 sqft.  in the standard suite\nAwesome tub\nComfortable furniture and bed, nicely appointed\n2 large screen TV's\nsmoke free :)\nno gambling :)\nawesome view from palms, rio, across i15 to bellagio, paris, fountains etc\n\nCons:\nPicky but would be nice to have a TV in the bathroom\nValet only\nWhy didn't they put a tunnel from Vdara to Aria so you don't have to walk outside?  I guess walking outside in 60-70mph winds made me think of that lol (it's really not that far)"
1,"Management wake up! You have the coolest  restaurant/bar around but the service is probably the worst I have ever seen. I have been here several times and the same problem continues... Poor service! Serving staff is lacking direction, in fact I saw several customers leave because they could not get service and the waitress didn't even know they were her table to serve. It took me 30 minutes to get a beer on several of my visits. The positive is the atmosphere both on the rooftop and downstairs. It is unique and very cool. Also the food I have tried was different and very tasty. If you go to the rooftop be prepared as the service is very slow. I learned to order 30 minutes in advance to get my order due to the slow service. This could be a fantastic place to go for food and drink, but if the service does not improve customers will eventually get too frustrated and find somewhere else to go, and in Downtown Chandler there are plenty of options."
0,7 of us Went for lunch on our lunch hour. It was severely understaffed. Took an HOUR (no exaggeration) after ordering before we even received our food. When one member of our party tried to politely say something to the doughy manager didn't even attempt to listen and walked away from her in the middle of her sentence. Terrible service. We were all late coming back to work and they offered no remorse or even the slightest courteous customer service.  Food was good but the service was so terrible it ruined everything. Avoid at peak lunch hours as they are NOT prepared.
1,"Had super high expectations based on the reviews, but food was bland, service was terrible, and we took our food to go and they forgot the grape leaves-the whole reason I got the veggie spreads plate!  Not cool!  Won't return."
0,"I'm sorry, but a few heavy bursts of air is NOT enough for me. I had read the reviews of this place on here and thought, this place is GREAT! I'm going to have to go there. Even though it's a bit out of my way, I made the 'trek' to Clean Freak Car Wash. \n\nTheir \""Obsessively Clean\"" package seemed great to me. $22/mo for unlimited full package car washes (usually $10 each), AND you weren't billed until NEXT month (so a whole month free of car washes if you sign up early in the month)! Foolishly, I signed up. I figured I'd be coming back often, based on the glowing reviews. Little did I know that I wouldn't be able to cancel and not be billed (it needs to be seven days before the next billing cycle, and like I said, I stupidly signed up two days before the end of the month). \n\nANYWAY, that's not what I don't like about this place. It's their right to have whatever cancellation policy they wish, and I was an idiot for not thinking ahead.\n\n First off-- as I went through the wash, their rollers knocked my mirrors in, which I felt shouldn't happen, and the WORST part-- at the end... NOTHING! Basically you drive through the thing, and there's NO one to even DRY your car when it's all done. I'm not looking for a wax and a buff, but come on. It left water spots ALL over my car, and I had to go get it washed somewhere else. I went to Wash Wizard, which is MUCH closer to me and I got pretty much a full service wash for only $7, and there was no abrasive scrubbing. Much better value in my personal opinion."
4,"Very friendly service. Reasonably priced, and the food was good! I'd definitely eat here again."
1,"I'm a very big fan of burgers and take them pretty seriously. This place seems promising but ends up falling short. \nMy little sister loves this place because she is young and still prefers cheese burgers with boring toppings... like plain cheese and ketchup. The chuck box makes a good boring burger. They fall short of their topping options. The lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, ect. are subpar. I believe a good burger needs a good selection of fresh toppings. \n\nThe don't appreciate the value of fresh burger fixings. They would greatly benefit from putting more effort in keeping the fixings fresh."
3,The staff here is great.  Knowledge is key. Smiles are key.  With any doctors office your gonna wait.  Whether u have a appointment or not.  They have a pharmacy on site which is way cool and convenient
2,"This buffet is good but not excellent, I know of quite a few that are better but it is in the middle of the pack. Seating is cramped and takes awhile to get drink refils. The deserts were good and food was solid. But, I think it should be spectacular for a place that strives to be yet, it is happy being mediocre and not work long wait."
2,"Yeah!  Tasty Mexican!  Modern decor and an old b/w movie being projected on the wall while we were there. Neat.  The menu is small, but you should be able to find something you like.    There were some fruity looking drinks being served in Mason Jars as well.  I was too chicken to ask what they were!  We were happy to be able to get out Mexican fix even in Montreal."
4,"Lots of love to this TJ's.  I recently moved away from this intersection but used to be across the street.  I love my people here Mimi, Jason, Bob and George.  Everyone is actually super nice and helpful.  They have some awesome product.  I have mentioned in the talk thread my love for the Shrimp Green Curry with Jasmine Rice.  They have amazing stuff like tomatillo-avocado salsa, a variety of hummus, fat free Greek Yogurt, mint iced green tea, all sorts of nut mixes, long stemmed artichokes, etc.\n\nI love the wine selection and feel great every time I walk in.  I always find something new (mini kiwi for example) or enjoy special items (meyer lemons).  Eric R. likes their muffins.  The best part is - samples are always available!"
0,"Worst McDonalds anywhere! If I could rate them lower than a 0 I would. I went thru the drive thru and my son pulled in behind me. When I got to the window I paid for my son's order. When my son got home I asked him why he didn't at least thank me and he was clueless. Seems the employee (Zack)  took his money as well as mine.  OK so call me dumb because I trusted a McDonalds employee to do the right thing but when I called the manager to report what happened, she said (1) she couldn't look at the video tape of the event and (2) she would count the drive thru drawer to see if the money was missing. Really?  Oh my what kind of manager is that clueless? What good would counting the drawer do if the kid stole the money and put it in his doggone pocket? AND, I have worked with security cameras at 4 different locations and have never not had instant access to the video footage. I don't believe she was telling me the truth. Imagine that? Regardless, I will not return to this McDonalds ever again."
2,"Hmmmm...we had such high hopes!  \n\nWe went there for a Saturday lunch today.  When we walked in the place was full, but we only had to wait about 2 minutes for a table to open up.  Nearly perfect timing!  It was a beautiful day, so NoDA was packed with pedestrians, and we considered ourselves fortunate to grab a table so quickly.\n\nA few minutes later our waitress took our drink and appetizer orders.  They have very little available for children to drink - no juices other than what they use at the bar, and no milk.  For kids who don't like soda or plain water, there's not much choice.  My son ended up drinking nothing for the entire meal because he hates soda and they didn't have milk or juices available.\n\nFor the apps we ordered the mussels and the brussel sprouts.  The mussels were delicious and I could have eaten those all day long.  I found the brussel sprouts to be VERY bitter and could only eat 3-4 before the overwhelming bitterness became too much.\n\nAbout five minutes after our appetizers arrived, the kids' food arrived at the table.  We finished our apps soon after that and then waited....and waited...and waited.  Our kids were halfway done with their food before our waitress came over to refill a glass and I asked where the food for the two adults was.  She said it was coming out next.\n\nSo we waited...and waited.  For about 30 more minutes.  By then our kids were long since done with their food, and getting bored just sitting there (thank heavens for phones with games galore!).  Methinks the waitress forgot to put in the complete order - that's the only thing I can think that would have caused such a major delay.  But we kept our smiles through the whole thing, continuing to keep the kids occupied while we waited.\n\nFINALLY she brought out our food, and apologized for the long wait.  It's not like we ordered complicated food.  My husband got one of their standard crepes and I got a burger (having originally planned to have a dessert crepe).   There was NO REASON that burger and those crepes should have taken nearly 45 minutes to come out to the table (which was the time from when the appetizers were cleared away to when the food finally arrived).  Other tables around us were being served - including tables that arrived AFTER us.\n\nAnyway, despite the wait, the food was good.  My husband enjoyed his crepe (spinach and mushrooms) and my burger was perfectly cooked and with amazing flavor.  \n\nAs we were finishing, our waitress came over and apologized for the long delay and said she would reduce our bill as an apology.  She also asked if we wanted a dessert crepe, but in the end we decided against it.  We didn't feel like waiting anymore and wanted to get back out into the sunshine to enjoy the rest of our day.\n\nWill we go back?  Probably not.  While the food was good, it wasn't a meal that made us say, \""WOW - WE HAVE TO GO BACK!\""  Add in the slow service (the restaurant was always full, but surely they should be used to that given how few tables they have?) and it's not a place to which we'd return."
0,"I was really excited to try this place, even told my sister about it! She went before me and didn't like her iced latte but I tried it anyways. I got a coffee with caramel and almond milk and it was so bad I threw it away and went to Starbucks, all on my way to work. Bummed, especially since it was almost $4 for a coffee!"
0,"I would honestly give this Whole Foods zero stars if I could. \n\nWhole Foods was closed for the night, but my family was already inside finishing up their shopping and checking out. \n\nI had to use the restroom and went to the door, explaining that my family was inside and I needed to use the restroom, could I please come in and use it. \n\nThe employees were very rude to me and said, \""Sorry, we're closed and won't let you in\"" despite my explanation and the fact that I didn't even have money on me. \n\nThis was absolutely ridiculous behavior since my parents were paying customers and already inside. This was terrible customer service and I will not return to this Whole Foods in the future."
0,"Over priced,  Over hyped restaurant. .. nothing to write home about. Stick with Twin peaks."
3,"A meat lover's dream! All you can eat buffet with ham, beef, chicken and more! \nIf you're a seafood lover, you are in the wrong place! \n\nWe came for brunch around 10 am, it was very crowded already and about a 15 min wait. \n\nFood selection included breakfast, omelet station, meat and cheese and a small Chinese station.  There is a dessert area, catering to your sweet tooth. \n\nIt is reportedly the best Buffett here in Vegas, and all you can drink can be added for total price of 51 dollars per person. See pics for food selection.  \n\nService was attentive and waiter brought us 4 rounds of drinks.  He did try to add extra on our drink but we said this is the wrong bill and he corrected it. He admitted he pressed the button too many times and that was the cause of the error. \n\nFood was tasty and not too salty. Plenty of selection for the most picky. However more seafood selection would be an improvement."
2,"For some strange reason, I've always had something against Tea Station. The thing is, it's been such a long time since I last went, I don't really remember what it is. But it's something that has stuck in my mind for years and I avoided the place like the plague. Was it bad service? Reading other people's reviews, that could be it.\n\nAnyway, I finally returned this evening to hang out with a friend. We didn't order anything demanding - just a couple of drinks. The waitress took our order quickly, the drinks came out in good time, and then they left us alone as we talked for a couple of hours. When it was time to leave, it was easy enough to flag the waitress down, get the check, and be on our way.\n\nOther people have mentioned that their service has vastly improved. I'll second that. It certainly was fast, accurate, and then invisible when we didn't need them. I'll still choose other boba places during the day when everything is open, but if you need a late night fix or just a chill late night hangout spot, Tea Station is a solid choice."
2,"If you are looking for light bites at happy hour prices this is great. We arrived after 9 on a Friday night and it was not packed. The live music was very entertaining.\nWe enjoyed the crab cake, which for being in a land locked state is great and the scallops too were tasty.\n2 drinks each and 2 apps shared we got out for $20 each. Pretty good deal."
2,"the interior is not what i was expecting at all. its super bright and almost clinical. wasnt very comfy-feeling. tons of beer and found a great pumpkin ale.\n\nthe food was a huge MEH. neither dishes were very good at all. i might come back for a beer if in the neighborhood, but i would go somewhere else to eat first."
0,Do Not Stay here! Rude staff! They try to sell you a time share and waste your day! Rude rude rude never again
3,"So stumbled upon this new store on Craigslist when I was searching for fish to buy so here's the pros and cons \n\nPros: \nService: Great staff and service,the staff greeted me the first step I took into the store and love to chat and help you out with any question.\n \nFish: This store only carry saltwater fish and even  tho when I was there their fish selection was a lil meager but what they had in the tanks was healthy and the price was far since it was a fairly new store it was very clean \n\nCorals: they have a huge selection of corals and the price are not bad either \n\nCons:\n\nService: none \n\nFish: I guess they have been busy cos for the past two times I been in they where low on small to mid size fish and they where two weeks apart\n\nCorals: will I bought a Maximus clam and it had three aiptasia on it so make sure you check what your getting thoroughly!"
2,"just a heads up for anyone who happened to browse the resort's website before looking on yelp before booking a stay... BEWARE: the photos on the website are misleading!\n\nthere is NO CASINO (it closed down)! \nthere is NO marketplace (we had to drive 3 miles to the nearest albertsons to get water and snacks)\n\nin fact, i'd say half of the stores in the \""village\"" were closed down (they were probably once open, but poor business forced closure?). and for the sparse restaurants that WERE open, what few workers they had were slow and apathetic. \nthat bustling village in the photos on the website? yeah - not even close. those pictures probably haven't been updated in years. I think the best way I could describe how the resort village is is: one of the more fortunate surviving towns in the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse on the Walking Dead.\n\nbut to be fair, the loneliness does make for a peaceful getaway. the lake and view is still gorgeous - and they still offer paddleboarding, kayaking, and pedal boating (I probably saw about 3 people out in the water the whole weekend I was there - but they offer the activities nonetheless). the rooms themselves are beautiful, and the workers are decent. \n\noverall, if you're looking for a peaceful retreat for elderly relatives or overstressed adults who can't bear the chaos of The Strip and just want to lay by a pool/lake all weekend, this resort is a great choice. but if you're looking for any further form of stimulation/activity... look elsewhere!"
3,"Ok, I've been a big Richardson's fan since back in the day and love the Rokerij as well. I've been going there since literally before it opened (the dry run) and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception. On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, \""Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu\"", we looked at each other and said, \""Sweet\"" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there. Parking is easy with the new lot they added and the place is busy most nights of the week so if you are going with a group call ahead."
4,"Delicious! The staff is super friendly, the food is great, and they are quick! Their cinnamon roll is amazing, but does have small pieces of cooked cinnamon apples. Lunch was decent, but we mostly just go there for breakfast."
1,"Ok, so I shop at Christown mall sometimes.  Or is it Spectrum mall?  Does it really matter?  I admit, I've heard a lot of different things about this place, but it wasn't until I actually moved North of this place that I started coming here on a regular basis to run errands and get stuff done. \n\nLets be honest, of course there's other places to shop in town, but I think it's also fair to say that this place will never be Scottsdale Fashion Square, but then again, not everything will be.\n\nThe pros:\n\nI think their trying to make this place better.  There's a really nice Target, movie theatre, Costco and a few other shops that seem to have brought a cleaner, nicer environment to being here and a few places to eat in and out of the mall that are a okay.  There's nothing fancy about this place, but there's enough of a draw that I find myself here weekly running errands.\n\nYes, it's a weird mall, (and I really don't consider it a mall, as more of a shopping center, but hey, that's just me)\n\nThe Cons:\n\nI think the weakness is the few stores inside the mall that seem chinsy and the dirty wall mart that make it sad.  Like I said, its all about perspective here.  (never gonna be a Scottsdale fashion square) but its a heck of a lot better then shopping at Metro Center.  (and their trying to bring business back in, at least in the outer circle not the inside of the mall itself.\n\nIt's not that I'm to good for some places, but it's a real weak stream of small places that seem more geared to a crowd of teenagers, but hey, that's just me.  I know s this mall only has so much potential, but I feel like some of the random stores between Costco and Wal-Mart really don't appeal to most people.\n\nI still come here for the big box stores and a few others, but this place is a solid 2 stars, sometimes 3 depending on what kind of experience I have that day. I also like that the Costco food court is open to anyone and located outside of the store in the food court area versus inside the store where you have to be a member to eat there.  Big bonus points for that alone....."
4,This is a gem in the desert.  It has been here in the Valley as lo g as I remember and was a favorite field trip.  Now we love to go as adults and enjoy the holiday luminarias and the artwork.  Became a member too.
4,"The entire staff was knowledgeable and sympathetic to our situation (emergency surgery for pyometra). Multiple treatment options were presented to us and there was excellent communication at all times regarding our pup's condition. They were super supportive and also aware of the financial crunch emergency care can cause and were excellent at providing necessary care without gouging us monetarily. Dr. Velasquez and Dr. Ciminello were very nice and called me with multiple updates on our chihuahua's condition, and Dr. Rizzo did a fantastic job on the surgery itself and went above and beyond the pyometra to remove some tumors in the same area. While I hope to never need an emergency clinic for our pets, if the situation arose I would 100% be comfortable bringing them to EAC Phoenix."
0,"This review only pertains to the deli area of the market. I went there for a quick bite to eat tonight with my family. Not that I was expecting a gourmet meal, but I thought it would be decent. NOT. I had the combo platter which I ordered as one of the selection, the beef (?) tendon and meat dish. I took a bite of the tendon and it was rock hard, then I took a bite of the meat and it turned out to be spoiled! I lost my appetite after that. They replaced the dish for us and promptly got rid of the rest out of the line. Good point here. Then I ordered the stewed pigs ear. I took one bite of it and it was under cooked , tough and no flavor. So I went up to the counter just to let them know. The response I got was what deserved the one star rating. The lady told me that the stewed dish was meant to be finished by cooking it at home. She added rudely that then the dish would be tasty. I thought it was a ready made dish. Well I will not be eating at this establishment again. It is gross and their attitude really suck!"
3,"This place is a sleeper. It's mixed in along with a cluster of other clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale but has a very unique vibe. Lotsa tequila, which can be a very good or very bad thing, as we all know, but reasonable prices and a good inside/outside mix. People seem to always congregate inside near the bar or outside at the tables, never so much in what looks to be the dining area. \n\nThe bathrooms are pretty gnarls barkley, but with that much booze and Corona floating around that's bound to happen. Food is so/so, but the staff is always friendly and quick to help out."
0,"This sushi joint looks and smells great but I left highly unimpressed. The waitress was flat with no personality, no time management, and said little to nothing. Most of her time was spent in the service well talking to some stereotypical \""bros\"". The shrimp tempura roll was labeled $5.75 but we were charged $8.50. I wanted to bring this to the attention of our waitress but I couldn't chew and swallow fast enough to say something before she'd drop and run. The tempura roll was bland and made sloppily. However, the sushi rice was made perfectly, it was sticky and just a little sweet. Both the fried rice and yakisoba noodles were drenched in sesame oil and were only enjoyable after a liberal application of Sriracha. For $64, bad service, and just okay food I won't return and do not recommend this place."
1,"This store is a bit pricey .  Your $$ goes further at H&M and Forever 21.    For the price,   Zara fits the value better.   Also,   I didn't realize many of their garments can't go to dryer.....until it's too late."
4,This place is awesome! My favorite lesbian bar in town!
2,"Here is it. \n\nFood- yes, the food was good, more like B+ good, not great though. My dish was really tasty (filet mignon) and it had a lot of sauce added to it. My girlfriend's plate was so so, she had the salmon or sea bass, not too sure which one but it did lack flavor, too bland. We also had the scallops for an appetizer and for $26 for 3 scallops they we not the best tasting by far. \n\nService- They were good too, not the best but good for their restaurant. \n\nOur table- the table was not the best and from what I had heard, there was not a bad seat in the house. Yeah, we had a small table in the back corner and it was very uncomfortable, I do not know why they even have a table there. The amazing views of the strip are for only about a third of the restaurant, the rest are not all that (who wants to over look housing?). \n\nAtmosphere- Look, if you want to have a quality meal go to Alize, but I will say this you will be bored and after you eat you will want to head back to your room and call it a night. The vibe is for someone who likes food and wants to talk for 2-3 hours after. I thought this place would set me up for a night out, I was totally mistaken. Will I go back? Probably when I feel like treating my parents. \n\nOverall- I didn't want to dis this place too much, but you really need to try it out for yourself. The restaurant is very nice and they have a ton of old bottles which can go for 30k each. What average person actually buys that? Go try the place out, you may enjoy it. \n\nCheers"
3,"Love this store! I'm a big fan of shopping on a bargain and this department store is one of my favorites. I always find somethign cute in the clearance section, plus I got a free printable coupon for 10% off of merchandise at www.destinationcoupons.com! Any opportunity to save money on my favorite hobby is very welcome, haha!"
4,"Oh my Gato... as soon as I get back to Phoenix, step off the airplane I'm bringing my happy ass right back to Don Pancho's!!  This place is AH-MAZE-ING!!!  I tried every taco they offer (don't judge me, we just finished hiking the White Tanks) and each one was better than the last.  Salsa bar, fresh and fresh, check.  Fantastic Horchata, check.  Best street tacos I've had since being in Sayulita Mexico, check!  Super rad/friendly employees, double check.  They were so helpful and accommodating, the nice lady went back and brought us a basket of chips with each of the different taco meats on them so we could try them out.  Who is that awesome?  Don Pancho's, that's who!!  My wife tried the fried quesadilla and I still have dreams about that thing, usually it ends with me waking up in a cold sweat chomping on my pillow.  \n\nAnyway, if you live in or near Phoenix and haven't been the Don Pancho's yet, you should be ashamed of yourself and should probably move to Antarctica, or the moon."
1,"Every time I'm in a asian restaurant, customer service is something I don't expect.  It almost goes hand in hand.  Asian restaurant = bad customer service.  \nPho Kim Long has bad customer service.  It's expected, so I won't dwell on it.\nThe first time I came, I was with a party of 5.  One of my buddies got a hot bowl with cold soup.  How that happens,  I can only imagine.\nI tried the Pho, I asked for egg noodles and got rice noodles.  I then asked the waiter where my egg noodles were he replied with \""Are you sure you ordered egg noodles?\""\n\nI was there just yesterday and I must say that the Pho isn't all that great.  I had pan fried noodles and I received a plate that was drenched in sauce.  When my pan fried noodles are drenched in sauce, there really isn't a point to order pan fried noodles.  \nI've had the chicken teriyaki and it was okay.  Teriyaki Madness makes just as good of a chicken teriyaki as Pho Kim Long.\n\nI notice this place is voted best in Vegas, however it must be voted by non asian people as this restaurant is full of non asians and even the asians that review this place don't give it a good review."
3,"I'm giving it 4 stars. This is because I'm trying to judge this place objectively. \n\nIt is nice. It is very small. It is decent. It looks like the type of place someone from a rom-com would go to on a first date. It is lovely in a lot of ways. I always hear people talk highly of it.\n\nI'm not super into the singer/song writer thing. Maybe if I were more into that then I would appreciate it more.\n\nIt just is so....stuffy to me. I feel guilty for laughing in there. I have a loud cackle that I cannot control when someone makes an especially good joke. I have to really try not to laugh when inside The Evening Muse (WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO REALLY LAUGH)\n\nI think this is probably a really great place for a lot of people. I just don't get it. It is me- not them. I have heard that they are involved in the community and that is great.\n\nSo, yay, take a date here. Just be prepared to sit and not dance."
3,"this McDonald's is one of the busiest ones in the valley.  Service & Cleanliness can be 100% spot on... And then they get hit with a zillion kids and/or movie goers.  In 30 minutes the place looks like it's gone to hell in a hand basket.   So one minute service is just peachy, another and they don't seem to have enough employees.. But there will be lines out of the double laned drive up  window and crowds around the counter...  As a regular there, they do an admirable job but will always have nay sayers at this and similar locations... of any fast food restaurants."
3,"Good, simple, reasonably priced. Chicken strips were juicy and it looks like they add panko bread crumbs to their strip breading. Not sure tho but it tastes bomb. I had the 2 hot chicks combo (a hot dog w a chicken strip instead of the weiner) with a side of their Mac n cheese. I like that they also add mozzarella to their Mac n cheese. Nice sauce choices too. Had the wasabi cream n traditional buffalo."
4,I was there last night. I have to say that it had been many years since I had experienced superior customer service like this. The restaurant manager is Top Notch! She is amazing and I'm sure will have a great future with her incredible service skills. \nI am very pleased with this place. It will become one of my favorite places. I recommend everyone to visit. Customer service is what makes average become excellent.
2,"Let me paint the scene for you: It's about 2:30 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. My friends and I have been at the Lady Gaga show for the past 4 hours, before that we were in a hotel room imbibing in a few adult  beverages. Now it's late, we're starving and there is no McDonalds in sight (by the way, what's up with that?!) So we beg our cab drive, 'PLEASE SIR, Take us to somewhere that's delicious!' And Fuel Pizza is what we found, or rather what we were taken to. \n\nThere was good and bad to this trip (bear with me, my mind is a little foggy on the exact details). We arrive, step out of our cab and see that the line is out of the door and down the street a few people. Yikes. But we're hungry, and we're a little tipsy* so of course we decide to wait. We chat, time goes by, but it is a LONG wait. On the plus side, I think it's awesome that there is a pizza place that stays open past 2am - that's a very rare find where I'm from in the Hampton Roads area. \n\nAnyway, we finally get to order: a few slices and a few garlic knots. The prices are good, I think I paid 6 bucks for a drink, a garlic knot, and two slices of cheese. The pizza is alright - it's thin crust and greasy, but let's be real - that's the best kind of pizza when you've been out and about all night being tipsy*. So it was a fun experience, just me, my friends, and every other drunk in Charlotte waiting for a slice of pie.\n\n*We took cabs ALL night long. If you're gonna be tipsy, be responsible."
1,"Very average. But was free so didn't care. Would not pay for this, tough. Small selection and low quality. Was filling but with so many options in the city... Will probably only go if starving and free. Not horrible but just not really special. Although, new owners might change that. Haven't been there since the change."
0,If I could rate this place 0 I would....watch every bite of your food closely you may find a little creature in your food...and they will do nothing about it except take your food back and not refund you and tell you to get lost...RUDEST PEOPLE EVER!!
3,"I made a reservation for this place a week in advance. left a voicemail and the host gave me a call back right away and reserved my party.That's a plus! We came a little bit late because we were driving in from California but we were only 15 mins late. however the host still allowed us to keep the reservations. Another plus! \n\nThe clerk , did a poor job in explaining the rules. When we walked in at 9:30 She told us that we could play as many games within the hour. when you purchase time. But they didn't make us finish our game nor did they make us finish our time. So I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager and he (Kevin Stone) took his own sweet time to come speak to us while he was talking on the phone. It was soo long that we had to walk up to him and stare at him for 5 more mins until he noticed that we were standing there. \n\nHowever,   recently the Marketing Coordinator or lucky strikes contacted me on yelp and was really sorry about my incident. She agreed to give me 2 hours of play time back.  \n\nThat  was great on their part. Lucky strikes has definately changed my mind about there customer service. The marketing rep has gone above and beyond and I really appreciated that establishment. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. \n\nKudos to Lucky Strikes and looking forward to giving them another chance.!!"
0,"This place blew on every level of suckness. I ended up in this dump because of a welcome home party for someone I indirectly knew. First, the waitress was as dumb as rocks. She kept coming back & telling us they were out of 9/10 beers on tap. 30 min later we got our room temperature pitcher. Secondly, I ordered cheese sticks & then waited 45m for some steaming pile of crap. The cheese sticks were way over cooked with the cheese pouring every where and there was some strange black substance covering them. Thirdly, when our waitress finally came back and informed us of our tabs, she over charged all of us, and never brought back our change. Then continued to come around once in a while and try to convince us we needed to pay for our tabs. I was hoping this would be a chill place to hang out and play pool but instead it's the epitome of low rent. Stay away if you want to hang on to your cash."
0,"Arrrrrr... this place sucks, matey!\n\nCheck-in be requiring ye scurvy dogs to wait in a line that resembles the baggage check at most airports before a major holiday. Arrrrrr... it be taking 40 minutes to check in to this dreary hotel-- not exactly the kind of activity ye wants after traveling many nights following the north star. And while many hotels be eliminating \""hotel fees\"", Treasure Island plunders $25 dollars nightly, which doesn't include basic pirate amenities like coffee in ye room. It does afford ye entrance to their buffet, which be the only authentic part of the experience because the food be tasting like rancid pirate chum! Did I mention our bed was broken?\n\nI heard the scurvy jester who ran The Frontier into the ground purchased this place a few years back, which is why it be as nasty as the inside of a pirate's boot. The staff be acting rude and should be forced to walk the plank.\n\nPoint ye compass elsewhere, there be no treasure here!"
0,"This was some of the worst pizza I've had in Vegas. Even if I was to ignore the flavorless sauce and the doughy crust, I just can't recommend you eat at a pizzeria that uses such terrible cheese. It had the flavor of nacho cheese from a dollar theatre. There are quite a few better places on Fremont st. so by all means eat at those.  I can't even recommend that you eat here if you're drunk."
3,"Enjoyed my first and only visit.  Great service, nice food, will return next time I need a good restaurant.  I would say 3.5 and moving up to 4.0 stars at times."
1,"When the gym first opened and I joined it was pristine. I understand that as a gym ages things get broken and old. However, lately it feels like management takes no pride. Machines are broken for weeks. Other equipment are broken as we'll without any visible effort to fix them.  As expensive as membership fees are, there's really no excuse for letting a gym get so decrepit. Many of the fitness instructors have also left to go to other gyms. I honestly stay because it's the only gym near my work. I wish some other club would open giving them so competition and incentive to make the gym nice again."
0,Place looks great but sevice and food is AWFUL!\n\nI GOT FOOD POISIONING HERE from the Loaded Totor Tot Nachos....avoid at all costs. I have been puking all day any trying to get better. It was not the drinks last night either as I had two beers the entire night taking it easy.\n\nThe service was awful as well as we had to ask where our server was twice since he was no where to be seen.
2,"My son & his friends LOVE chicken shack so I decided to give it a try. It is a very busy place so they must be doing something right. My biggest complaint is how small the place is. I was placing an order to go, the counter to order is in the back, there is a 4 top on the left & the soda dispenser on the right. I have an 18 month old & had her with me. So trying to not have her grabbing or hitting the people at the table & not play with the soda machine left VERY LITTLE room. I was in the way of staff coming from the back to hand out orders & for people trying to get refills. We finally get to the counter & I asked a few questions making it obvious it was my 1st visit. I place an order for 24 lemon pepper wings & a garlic Parmesan fingers meal. I pay & turn around to go wait & there's nowhere to go. They was 3 people in line behind me 2 other people waiting for their to go orders & 2 people trying to get refills. SO CROWDED. I finally get out of the way & go to wait at a 2 top, the only open table. My order didn't take to long. I get home w it & unpack it & there was no sauce for anything, wings, fingers or fries. I'm assuming now it's something you order as well. That would've been nice to know. \n\n\nNow the food itself, it was very good. The chicken was cooked to perfection & the fries were great. We will go back but try different flavored, the lemon pepper was good, garlic Parmesan needs more garlic & Parmesan. We'll also be sure to ask for sauces!"
2,"Heh. This is a fun place to relive your twenties (or experience them, if you're still there!) with beers, slots, bros and pong. Of course, it's filthy, there is a really gross fat burlesque dancer, and the bros can be a little overpowering. \n\nBut there's beer pong, strip poker, and a lot of really crazy sh*t going on. It was great to have a look, get a beer and check stuff out, then move on."
1,"Sorry. Can't give this place more than 2 stars for a couple reasons. First time I came here, the waitress was really sweet, but forgot to put in my boyfriend's order for a shake, and neither of us were that terribly excited about the food we did receive, especially for the price. Also, I realize it may be hotel policy, but they wouldn't honor our Harrah's comp voucher unless we charged the meal to the room.\n\nSecond time, I go to place a to-go order for a burger and fries. Hostess says I need to order at the bar. Well, that's no problem for me. I don't care where I order. \n\nBut I proceed immediately to the bar, where for the next 7 minutes I witness the bartender flair pouring a vodka soda and opening two beers. Nobody clapped... nobody was even watching him. Nobody gave a crap about him rolling the cocktail shaker and Skyy bottle around on his palm and forearms for 3 minutes. Even the chick who ordered the round wasn't watching. (FYI: I have 8 years in the restaurant industry... 7 of which were as a bartender, so don't give me crap about not knowing what was going on. I would have filled that entire order in 40 seconds.) No matter where I go, I ALWAYS watch the bartender work, and this guy was a waste of waiting, paying customers' time! He and the barback never acknowledged me or anyone else, really, and I waited around a further few minutes after the \""show\"" was over. I walked out and ended up finished leftovers instead."
1,"My family loves this place so we've been dining here for decades.  Even when I was a kid I knew it was mediocre at best.  After not being forced to dine here for several years I came (with the family of course) on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago.  The menu's changed since 1995 but the food and service are still sub par.\n\nWe started off with the spinach dip in a \""brioche\"" bread bowl.  First of all, don't insult my intelligence.  I can tell the difference between brioche and a sourdough bread bowl from Safeway. This appetizer was reminiscent of something I would've brought to a potluck ten years ago. \n\nMy sister got the lobster ravioli. Definitely a two star dish.  The sunrise sauce (creamy tomato sauce) was OK but the ravioli lacked any type of flavor - lobster or otherwise.\n\nMy brother got the penne quatro formaggio. This was actually the best thing on the menu but it was just glorified macaroni and cheese.  Don't try to trick us common Mesa folk with your fancy Italian. \n\nMom got the spaghetti and meat sauce.  I didn't taste it because once I smelled it I didn't need to. Ugh.\n\nI got the berry and candied walnut salad.  The spring mix was old and it was nothing special.  I was just going for the least disgusting and calorie laden item on the menu.  Mission accomplished. \n \nService was unremarkable - drinks were refilled but she was MIA quite a bit.   \n\nEating here reminds me of Thanksgiving.  I know that I'll be with my family and I'll leave full but ultimately unsatisfied."
4,"This is the closest In-N-Out to my house.. and I'm in love. It's never crowded, and the service is fast and flawless. The employees are always smiling, and the burgers are perfection. How they make such fresh delicious burgers so cheap is amazing. If I'm going for fast food, In-N-Out is always my first choice!"
2,"I'm a big fan of their sister places, but had never visited A Room in the Town, previously. It was a touch underwhelming.\n\nOverall, we said: \""A Room in the Town is a smart place, with good, attentive service, but the quality of their dishes doesn't match this. Take the pointless croutons out of the soup, and the glob of vinegar off the egg, and you probably had two good but unremarkable dishes. I've always enjoyed my trips to their William Street place, but can't say the Dundas Street branch made such a positive impression. Maybe I'll pop by to try their dinner menu, at some point, as I like the set-up and suspect the kitchen is capable of producing better dishes than I was served, today.\"""
2,"C'Mon people.....this place is average. We stayed here because it was the only 3 star hotel under $100 a room the night before New Year's Eve. Check-in was quick and easy. The staff was helpful. We went to the Hooters restaurant in the hotel for wings and fries. Service was quick enough....food was good. \n\nWe stayed in room 509 in the Bay View tower. The room was clean. Carpet is stained, but the bed and bathroom were fine. \n\nI was really worried about staying at this hotel aftger reading all of the awful reviews on here. If you're like me, please don't worry. As long as you aren't expecting the Wynn, you'll be fine. We have stayed at the New Orleans and the Sahara and our room here was better than both of those."
0,"If every club in Vegas threw up and mixed it all together you would have Haze. Service was bad, we had a table and there was no control of people who were not with us messing with it. Its over crowded, and good luck with the cluster f*** of a line/entrance set up they have out front, they will make you wait in like 3 lines even though you have paid $1000 for a table and bottles then by the time you get in they have sold your table right out from under you, its a joke!! Go to Tao or Xs instead and you will get treated like they actually want you there! Also STAY AWAY FROM LIGHT GROUP!!! They own and run Haze, Gold, Deuce, Jet, The Bank, Bare, Liquid, Etc they are a bunch of evil terrible people who have to have been sent to this earth by satan himself!"
2,"My husband and I visited Dupar's a few times while we stayed in Vegas.  It was convenient (right below our hotel) and cheap (reasonable prices), and the food was pretty good.  We both mainly came for the shrimp cocktail; really, despite the fancy packaging, it's merely \""25-30 size\"" shrimp in a fancy sundae glass with cocktail sauce poured over it, which I could make at home.  But hey - it's 3 bucks.  It would cost me over 10 dollars to make it at home, so... as far as I'm concerned, I got a bargain.\n\nKudos to the servers here, who often have to deal with really obnoxious, drunken asses who come in (especially late at night).  My husband and I cringed one night when a huge group of ignorant, intoxicated meatheads came in and started making fun of their server's ethnicity.  Seriously?  The ONLY reason why I didn't get up and confront them, head-on, was because there were eight of them and, while I'm a brave lass, I'm no match for eight drunken men the size of football players.  So much cred goes to that server, though.  He kept his cool and didn't even flinch - totally expressionless.  I hope that he got a lot of BIG tips from other customers that night.\n\nThe rhubarb pie was... interesting.  That's all I'll say about that.\n\nReally, the shrimp cocktail is what you want to come for, more than anything.  And do ignore the previous review about how the shrimp wasn't \""salty enough\"".  I don't know where they hail from originally, but I'm from Maryland, which deals with a LOT of seafood every single day, and I can vouch for the fact that the shrimp cocktail here tastes exactly as it should.  \n\nGenerous portions and good prices.  And did I mention convenient?\n\nWe'd come again."
4,"5stars for the burgers!! \n\nGet the hangover burger best burger I've tasted, the bar is nice friendly people. A must go if your staying at this hotel."
4,"We where in Vegas for the easter long weekend and just had to find some great food.  Well finding this place wasn't easy but in the end it was like finding a great hidden treasure.  We ordered a sample of three Bao's (Pork Belly, Pulled Pork, and Duck)  with a Italian soda.  After that great meal we just had to order more due to the great taste.  So we ordered our favorite pulled pork and duck Bao's and just had to try their mushroom/tofu Bao.  Let's just say I am a picky person to please but this food was out of this world.  Great food, great service, good prices and great people.  Jenny and Sheridan are a amazing team and their food is fit for a kingor queen.  GO THERE AND EAT, and you will thank me later!  Great job guys!!!"
1,"We stopped in here for a couple drinks and a quick bite. We ordered a taco salad, which was REALLY boring. It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a sprinkle of cheese, tomatoes and beans; pretty disappointing for the price because this place is NOT cheap! Waitstaff were not around much. Overall, we would not go back again. \n\nBottom line: the drinks were alright and although the food was super basic and overly priced, at least it was somewhat fresh so we didn't get sick."
0,"The only positive thing this place has going for it is the decor.  \n\nI had Green Curry Chicken, but it was unlike any I had had before ... and not in a good way.  What I remember clearly is that the vegetables were cut/sliced too big, not cooked long enough and the sauce was very, very bland.   The food implied a technical familiarity with the the ingredients of Thai food but a complete lack of the artistry of it.   Thai food is all about a balancing of flavors and mouth sensations... 5 R Cha failed at that... miserably.\n\nI've had frozen Thai dinners that were better."
4,"Best Ever!! Are you kidding me? If you don't like this place stick to Taco Bell! Pork shoulder, short ribs, any of the tacos, and of course the guac, all will keep you coming back."
0,"I hate that I even have to give 1 star. I kept hearing how great this place was from a friend and the reviews were good. Since I was nearby I decided to check it out. Never again. I got one of the lunch specials which was a chicken enchilada, rice and beans. Lets start off with the enchilada....I asked for green sauce (chili). I don't know what that was but it definitely wasn't green chili. The cilantro lime rice?  Tasted like dried up white rice with some color added to it. You get a choice of black beans or pinto beans. I went with the pinto. Another...I don't know what was IN the beans but it was disgusting. My food was cold as well.  Anyone that knows me knows that I never throw food out. However, today I did just that. I wasn't able to even eat it!  I ended up throwing it away and I don't remember the last time I did that. I was so disgusted that I would not be able to even give it a 2nd chance."
4,"WHAT! CLOSED ALREADY!  And we only just getting to know each other!  If you locate somewhere else, please let us know!"
3,"La Tolteca is in my top 5 for my Taco Crawls with my Dad and my 91-year old Grandpa.  We loved this place.  \n\nThe Al Pastor taco is fabulous...marinated pork, cilantro, onions.  Mmmmm.  The Potato taco is also great...potato, sour cream, cabbage, queso fresco, tomato salsa.  The carne asada taco was tasty as well, but I agree with the other comments that it is a little fatty.  Some people like that, though.\n\nThey even sold us beers from the market area for $1.99 to drink with our tacos.  And, the salsa bar has an excellent guacamole based salsa.  Yum.  \n\nCan't wait to go back.  Oh yeah, and check out the murals...they are classic."
1,"As a first meal in Las Vegas, the Studio Cafe is a very poor choice indeed when compared to the food offerings.  Especially with all of the food choices at the same price range in the city.  An entree will set you back about $15 dollars, which I could have spent on a great lunch buffet at the M Resort.\n\nI had an incredibly dry beef rib roast sandwich.  Of course, they didn't advertise the sandwich as dry.  Also, they over-salted the au jous.  You don't need to salt au jous.  Not really anyways.  I would rather have no salt than oversalt.\n\nThe french fries do come in a cool metal basket and the manager Daniel (name?) was fairly nice.  That's why the two stars.  The basket amused me and the manager smiled."
0,Stopped in to browse & was saying what a great store they had.  I hike often & have horses so I could have spent a lot of $ there. Have a friend looking for a kayak & asked a simple question about the used kayaks @ the front  ... The sales guy gave me a very condescending answer & chuckled. I will never go back & will spread the word!!   Thx
1,"Sure it's a bit scuzzy, but they have a wall of freakin' Slurpee machines filled with booze.  \n\nIt's really the antithesis of everything a good cocktail should be.  And I should hate it.  But I don't.  Part of the problem comes from growing up in Miami.  \n\nThe national drink of the Florida Keys is the Rum Runner.  It's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of Miami.  But Fat Tuesday's has it.  Well, all Fat Tuesday's besides this one.  WTF.  \n\nI was surprised to see that they have a drink made with Pyrat rum.  And it was fine.  But it wasn't the Fat Tuesday's experience of my youth that I was hoping for. \n\nWhere did the Rum Runner go?\n\nWell, the bartender explained that they had to take out a few machines to make room for additional bottles of booze.  Apparently someone had the bright idea that Fat Tuesdays should actually mix cocktails besides just pour frozen boozy slushies into plastic cups.  \n\nWhoever had that idea should be fired.\n\nBoozy slushies in plastic cups is what this place is about.  And in the heat of a Tempe summer a Rum Runner would be just about perfect.  But they are gone because apparently some fool thought it would be a good idea to sell cosmos too."
0,"We went to the Pub because we wanted to try the great beers the Pub is suppose to have. While there, we also ordered the $1 Sliders. We sat at the bar, & it was obvious they were very understaffed. The bartenders were not able to keep up with the demand from the customers. We run a restaurant in another city, and all we could keep thinking was, Wow we really feel sorry for these bartenders. It is an impossible job. It took over 30 minutes for our turn to come up to be served. In that time, we saw lots of people leave because they couldn't get served. It just so happened that it was game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. It was so crowded in the Pub. The 2 bartenders never lost their cool and were very friendly, but they just couldn't keep up with the demand. What are the Pub's managers thinking. We would never run our restaurant this way. They only reason we are even giving 1 star is because the bartenders were trying so hard to do an impossible job. \nShame on you Monte Carlo! We expected so much more."
3,"I have been back now a couple of times and have to say this place rocks for being local.great service and pretty descent food. Hard drinks could stand to be poured a little better.. But I don't mind ordering beer so it's all good. Lots of TVs for viewing at every angle. The crowd tends to be in their 40s I would say which is older than what I go for. But when I want some quick wings and a beer it rocks. Also, omg get the fries with with ranch"
0,"I am very disappointed on the customer service in general. I had a seasonal business and I made an agreement with them before I gave them my business that they have to put me inactive for a good number of months and will let them know to activate me again. I called to put my account inactive immediately after the season was over. came to find out they were still pulling money from my bank. called again and I was assured they will process my request and refund the money. saw them again pull the money from my bank draft next month. I spoke to the so called supervisor and promised me on the stack of bible to correct the problem and refund me the mounting unnecessary charges. to my dismay after 4 months, I saw my statement got charged again. I was so fed up, and decided to go to my bank instead, paid a fee to initiate a stop payment. I felt that I rather pay a fee one time than have to deal with this ***. by the way, I am writing this not to smear anyone's reputation but to make you aware that a good company can become bad because of the customer service you hire. I know im sure for many you are satisfied. Apparently my experience with them was horrible. by the way, I gave prolific the benefit of the doubt bec they did the same to me last year. now they've done it again. So what does that tell me?"
3,"All the previous reviews on here are for dining, what about the hotel? I stayed 2 nights, a Sunday and Monday. Nice hotel! It is a grand  old mansion built circa 1886 and designated an historic landmark. Definitely an old school hotel, there is internet and basic TV, rooms are spotless and quiet and speckless. The place  has a certain charm to it. If you like your hotel to be quiet, quaint and a little quirky this is the place to stay. Located next to Carnegie Mellon University and within walking distance of the University of Pittsburgh. The surrounding neighbourhood is filled with similar old well kept mansions from 1880's and makes for pleasant walking. I will return to this hotel on my next trip to Pittsburgh. Would have been 5 stars if I had my own coffee maker in the room, but the staff is always ready to being you a carafe for no charge, I just prefer to wake up and not have to dress to go for my first coffee...."
1,"So this is my second time and not much has improved from the first time. The check in counter staff is sub par and probably half wits too. Not much changed from the last time where it took 30 minutes to check in one guest.\n\nSo I booked through hotels.com for a king size high floor room. That was how it was advertised. I get here and was told that my room is not available and that the rooms are reserved but you can't specify which type. Ok, then they need to talk to hotels.com because that is how they advertised it. \n\nOk, whatever I waited for 10 minutes to check in already and was not going to give this idiot anymore time. So after another 20 minutes of trying to figure out my reservation we go to the room and it definitely was not two queen beds but two beds that seemed to be over sized toddler beds. She did offer to switch me out but really? No one wants to do that. \n\nThe hotel seems to attract the weirdos too. There weren't that many last time I was here. There was a guy with a bloody forehead in the elevator with us. Nasty looking 17 year old justin bieber look alikes were out in full force. Not to mention the club scouts who approached anything that pranced around in high heels looking like they could barely walk as they tried to keep all their women parts in the three sizes too small dress\n\nThis is probably the last time I'll stay here. Sorry SLS, for trying to brand yourself, you are still really just made up Sahara. \n\nYour comps nights will do you no good. I'd rather spend money and be in a hotel that I know attracts less scumbags and has enough rooms to honor guests reservations. \n\nAND, resort fee? How can you charge as much as a Bellagio! You have nothing close to offer as \""resort-ish\"". Stop kidding yourself."
0,"My wife and I had a dinner on a Sunday night and I honestly wasn't that impressed. To me the prices here seemed pretty high for the amount of food you actually get. Example: the BBQ Combination Plate which had the BBQ Pork, Roast Duck and Chicken.  We were excited to order it but when we received it what a huge let down. \n\nThe serving size was pretty small and for the price (I believe it was $16.99) you'd expect it to be much larger. As far as the actual taste.....Hell, I've had better Chinese BBQ at the 99 Ranch in Chino Hills here in Cali.\n\nAlso, it had to have the filthiest bathroom that I've seen in awhile which really made wonder about the cleanliness of the place overall. \n\nOverall an underwhelming experience I'd say don't waste your time here."
0,"I visited the store at Mandaly Place last evening.  The service was pathetic.  I'm local and I typically shop at Neiman Marcus where the service is impeccable.  The store was hardly busy and the Sales lady stood there like a  mannequin.  She didnt welcome me or ask if I needed help.  I asked a question regarding a hand carved belt buckle.  I asked her if it was a belt buckle and her only response was \""yes\"".  She did not ask if I wanted to see it.  She did not ask if I was looking for anything in particular.  I highly recommend that they train their employees to be courteous and helpful.  I will continue to shop at Neimans where the service is appropriate.  Instead of posting this negativity on yelp I tried multiple times to send it only through Elton's website cutomer contact but it wouldnt go through.  So here it is instead."
3,"I was very happy with our stay for 4 days last week. Visitors from years passed told us it had really \""gone downhill\"" from the \""old days.\"" Maybe my standards are just lower, but we paid less than $40 (this included $11.99 resort fees*Snort*) so I will qualify my review as For a $40 Room....it was clean, it was quiet in our room, and we won money at the casino. What more d'ya want? I can't wait to go again. The movie theatre was a nice respite on a hot, windy day, and the buffet was a great price and very decent food. It's a 15 minute drive down busy Tropicana Dr to reach the Strip. By the time you've been run over by a drunk on a Rascal and smoked enough second hand smoke to have a disease, you will be thankful to return to Sams Town. Why not 5 stars? I didn't win enough to retire. And it was a great stay... For a $40 room."
2,"I chose to stay in a GO room and I think it was completely worth the extra bucks. The room was much larger than I expected, with two queen beds, each one covered in very clean looking white sheets with three down pillows each. I particularly liked the floor length windows which overlooked the garden and pool. the room came with  electric drape openers, You did not even need to get up out of bed  to open/shut drapes.  \nI especially appreciated the thermostat in the room - I like being able to adjust the temp to my liking. It is also energy efficient - It turns on when you slide the key card so it's not running the entire time you are out of the room.\nThe bathroom was well stocked with amenities. There were three sets of towels, each one being very nice think & larger than the usual. It was cool to have a TV built into the bathroom mirror. The room came with both a rainhead shower & body sprays plus a spacious bath tub. Caveat for group sharing: privacy is limited to frosted glass doors on both sides of the bathroom.\nThe room comes with a small refrigerator so you can load up your own beverages. The coffe pot is cute  & coffe was actually pretty good.\nCheck in was super easy, and you can actually check in from McCarran airport - which I will try next time I fly. Check out was also easy - via video link or just express drop-off in the lobby. \nThe pool is built for soaking, not swimming and caters really to kids, which is nice. The monorail has a stop here, but I did not go on it - it used to be free but now you need to buy a ticket.  \nThere is only one buffet area, a small Burger Joint (that is actaully its name) that only serves burgers and sandwiches one way, that is, not to order. They did have a colossal shake, very good. I tried to have lunch at the Japanese resaturant but they only have udon or ramen dishes - open for sushi only for dinner. \nI tried to get to a show but the theater is dark on Sunday & Monday for Donny & Marie. \nThe place is a good spot to do a bit of walking to other casinos -Bally's, Harrah's, Caesar's, Forum Shops, Mirage, Treasure Island, Etc... are all within walking distance, but remember to wear comfy shoes - it's a long walk back otherwise.\nOverall, a satisfactory experience."
2,"Can't really say it better than Jason C.\n\nOur visit here was okay. But I couldn't get over the bad lay-out and the waste of outdoor space. Seating was uncomfortable and the place was hot (in March) because no windows were open. The service was good (maybe over-attentive), but the overal experience wasn't one I'll soon seek out again."
2,I like this place. Super close to home. Kinda too busy for me at times. But good for them!\nDirty Chai latte....amazing..
2,"Went in here because I was craving asian food, and the sign clearly advertised \""pan-asian\"" cuisine. I don't see what's so \""pan-asian\"" about the place-- seems like your ordinary Chinese restaurant to me. I needed some lunch so i decided to give it a shot, so what the hey?\n\nThe management seems nice enough. Clearly it is owned/managed by actual chinese people so i suppose that ought to be somewhat reassuring when seeking out any sort of ethnic cuisine. The lunch special was well priced at 6 bucks, and included an egg roll.\n\nThe egg roll was your average spring roll. Probably would have been nice if it had been served with some sweet and sour sauce but I was too lazy to ask for some.\nI ordered the szechuan chicken, an item that you don't always see at your typical chinese fast food restuarants. It was decent-- fair amount of sliced chicken served with sliced onion, bell pepper, carrots, ginger and glazed in a dark sauce. It was quite salty and did not require additional soy sauce ( i imagine that was already added) and the spiciness seemed to come from some sort of pepper oil. It was spicy enough to satisfy my palate-- I didn't feel the need to ask for additional hot sauce. I was satisfactorily filled and thanked them for a pleasant meal.\n\nThe verdict: Nothing special to say here, this is your run of the mill sit down chinese restaurant. The food quality is good enough to earn your business, but I don't think it's worth going out of your way for. You could probably find tastier food at a PF changs to be honest but these guys aren't a bad deal if you find yourself in the spring valley area."
4,"I have to admit, I am a little bit of a Thai fanatic. I work close to Nunthaporn's so uasually when I eat Thai, Nunthaporn's is where I go. I went somewhere else close to my house the other night and I about spit it out, \""THIS is not Nunthaporn's!\"" \n\nI am used to such a high quality, delicious, flavorful dish from eating at Nunthporn's and other places just don't even come close. Now I thought... maybe it was just that one place... and then I made the mistake again with another that delivered to my house. It wasn't even comparable. \n\nIf you want the BEST Thai you have ever had, go to Nunthaporn's. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,food is better than average. the owner is a great guy.
0,"Oh yeah, this place absolutely blows. I'll enter in a new reason (though all mentioned are perfectly valid): Limited Clint Eastwood selections in the movie department. Fie!"
3,"McClintock and Warner location. It is small and a good store of the ease of getting in and out. It is an older location, and plans are in the works to update. Deli staff is very professional. Ken and Paul are great cashiers who know their customers by name. This is no Whole Foods, but when you need the gallon and milk and loaf of bread, you can find quickly and get on your way."
1,"Went here two weeks ago with the family, as we wanted to experience the lard burgers first hand.\nReally, the burgers here are just okay and the fries are not good. Coke in a bottle is nice, so they got that going for them.\n\nIf you need to test belly room with triple or quadruple size burgers, go for it. Believe I'll head elsewhere for a good single."
4,A great indoor place to bring the kids for something fun to do.  Highly recommend!
3,"For some reason I was always skeptical about this place.  But a group of us went this week and I was pleasantly surprised and will be back.\n\nI had a hard time figuring out what to eat but finally went with two appetizers. I started with the steak and lobster tarter.  The beef had a touch of truffles (and oil) while the lobster was creamy.  It was served with toasted baguettes.  It was a satisfying appetizer.  For my dinner I had the crab cake.  The crab cake is 8 oz of goodness.  It was almost all crab ... very little filler and a crispy outside.  \n\nEveryone else was happy with their choices as well: another crab cake, lemon sole, chopped salad and seared ahi tuna w/soba noodle stir fry.   Only two of us ordered wine and the rest stuck to water but our waiter was fantastic. The service was flawless.\n\nFor desert I had a butterscotch panna cotta that was excellent.  It was served with two biscotti but they weren't worth eating.  Too dry for my taste."
1,"This is a great spot for watching a game on one of plentiful TV's. Predominantly young & loud patrons on the Saturday night we were there. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you. Several 20-somethings were dancing near the bar and were clearly traaaaashed but the bartenders kept serving them. Kind of a South Side vibe in that respect.\n\nFood sampled included nachos (aka big heaping pile of multi-colored chips w/ very little cheese or other fixins under the top layer), asian shrimp wrap w/ few shrimp, and a cheeseburger w/ cole slaw on the side that wasn't bad but not great either.\n\nOrdered the Rivertowne Pumpkin Ale w cinnamon dusting on the rim and it was really a great tasting beer!! Super delish!!\n\nOur waiter was attentive and super nice but kept forgetting things like waters we ordered three times and small plates for nachos. \n\nBathroom was mostly clean & well stocked.  Nothing amiss there.\n\nProbably would go back but only for a drink. Good proximity to Heinz Field & PNC Park."
0,Really less quantity and totally dis-interested service .. Wasted my money here today ..
1,"Well this is a disappointment for me to write. I've been 3 times since I wrote my first review and each time they have served \""slop\"" !!!!!! From the tacos, to the enchiladas and even the salads. They just slop the ingredients into the plate and serve it up! It's gross now!!!!"
3,"LOVE all of the Trader Joe's.  This one, the parking lot is a little tough and an odd size for the location.  Otherwise, always great produce for a great price.  Always walk in and walk out with a ton of groceries without spending a fortune. Such a gem!"
3,"I had a fantastic meal at Windsor and cannot wait to go back!!  The problem is, they do not have very many vegetarian entr\u00e9e options.  I think their only entr\u00e9e is what I ordered - a veggie filled pita.  It was amazingly delicious, but I wish I had more options than that....or a salad.  I appreciate that this restaurant uses lots of kale and quinoa in many of their dishes - they are two of my favorite foods and are highly underused!!\n\nThe No. 89 is one of the smoothest cocktails I have ever had and would visit this place just for cocktails.  They also have wine on tap - which is supposed to be more environmentally friendly.\n\nThe music was too loud inside and the waiter could have been more attentive - but it was their opening week so I will let that slide."
0,"I dunno... \n\nI loved their LA store.  This one in Vegas, though, is like the LA restaurant's forgotten (disowned) little brother with drug and gambling problem.  \n\nWhere do I begin? \n\nThe service was not rude, just nonexistent.  The food was overcooked (I couldn't help but think that the two are correlated).  We never got the refill of the tea despite the waitress' acknowledgment of our multiple requests.  The meat was tasteless.  And by God, it's the Vegas strip price at $28 per person. \n\nRemind me to never go off the strip in Vegas again.  Unless we're going to Rehab at the Hard Rock Hotel."
0,"I have been wanting to try Scramble for a while - being excited about having a new breakfast place in the neighborhood. \n\nI went this morning with two others who also had not been there. We all were very disappointed. It is pretty close to fast food, but the prices were along the line of a regular sit down, full service restaurant. The only service you get is they bring you your food - everything else is self serve.  \n\nAll of this wouldn't be so bad if the food was great - but sorry to say it was not. I  had eggs benedict - the WORST I have ever had -$8. It first came to me with the egg pretty much raw - the white  part was all clear like it looks when you first crack the egg open. I had to take it back myself to the order desk. The person was very nice though. I waited a while - the others I  was with were now half way done and I had to ask someone about my meal. Someone brought it to me - only this time it was way overdone - the yolk was very hard. I then asked for the manager - he apologized and then had it redone. This time the egg part was correct. However I have to say also the hollandaise sause was not good - very thick. The other two with me each had a cheese omelette. Neither cared for it much. One had hash browns - very average - and one had bacon - kind of too smokey. One had the Jalapeno Corn Bread which was good. I had a side of  dollar pancakes - and honestly I make better ones with Aunt Jemima mix.  This was a lot like cafeteria food. \n\nThe manager did not deduct anything for my eggs benedict problem, but instead gave me a card to come back for a free eggs benedict. I'm thinking - No Thank You!!!"
2,"Instead of going thru the Drive-Thru, I walked in and order Hot Cafe Mocha and light Carmel Frap with both  light on the whip cream. The gal that was making the Frap got lost into what she was making and the whip cream oozing out of the top. My Cafe Mocha seemed to be watered down."
0,"Looked for a British pub to get some good fish and chips. Found this place on Yelp and drove over. Walking in I found out that it has a pretty big bar and we were seated right next to it. Very fricken loud in here and the smell of smoke is awful. Ordered the fish and chips and waited. The order came to the table and it was a decent sized piece of some kind of fish. Was served with thick fries and some peas. The batter wasn't good. The fish was tasteless and it was unchewable on one side of it. The waitress never came back to ask about our food as she was also the bartender. Also, my soda was flat and had NO carbonation. Place overall sucks and I will never spend a dime in this waste of space crap-hole!"
0,"I scheduled a cleaning service for today at the last minute because my regular cleaners were unavailable. Hey, it happens but I was desperate--and it was my own fault for waiting to call my regular cleaners (Wave House Cleaning in Tempe).  \n\nWhen I was setting up the appointment Angela was responding immediately to my emails and quoted me a very reasonable per hour price of $59 for the first 3 hours for 2 people.  Anything after that would be prorated at a $25/hour price.  I wrote out a check and left it at home for my husband to give to the cleaners.\n\nI emailed Angela yesterday to get a time estimate for when the people would be coming.  She never responded.  I sent an email first thing this morning, no response.  I then proceeded to make around 23 calls to the phone number listed on the website (which was the same number in her email signature), none of which were answered.  \n\nFour hours later I received an email from her saying that \""they would be there shortly and if not they would get there between 12-1.\""  I'm not quite sure at which point this type of vague response became appropriate for people to use with their customers but hey, that's just my luck, I guess.  \n\nThey finally arrived at 12:45. Two hours later (at 2:30) I get a text from my husband who was home asking me to forward him the email with the agreed upon pricing. He then calls me and tells me to speak with one of the women who was cleaning my house.  She proceeds to tell me that Angela told her that she would be getting somewhere around $75. I explained to her that I have it in writing and the check was already made out--that's the price she got paid! \n\nAfter they left, my husband called me again and said \""can you believe they gave me an invoice for $112?\"" I was shocked.  They had almost doubled the quoted price and tried to swindle us into paying way more!\n\nI read the other Yelp reviews and thought that sometimes people just have bad experiences with good companies.  Nope.  Not in this case. I should have waited for my regular cleaning service instead of trying to get it all done right away by using a different company for one day.  Never again.  \n\nAfter all is said and done, the house does look fine. But we didn't have them do very much, to be honest. I cut out one room and one bathroom (of our 3 rooms and 2 baths) and told them just to vacuum in our master bedroom.  That left one room, one bathroom the kitchen and living room.  We don't have a huge house, so I knew they wouldn't need to spend that much time there.  Definitely not $112 worth of time. They were only there for 2 hours.  My regular service is there for close to 4.5 sometimes, but usually they are there at least 3.5 hours and I pay way less than $112 for much better service."
1,"The food here was amazing, went for a lunch on a Friday and had a tuna bagel sandwich and some hummus with onion and pine nut. I also had a lemonade/mint smoothie/iced thing that was refreshing and different. My wife had a delicious panini with mushrooms that was even better than mine. So the food was great, why the three star review you say? \n\nHere's why I give Panini cafe two stars: I have never felt so uncomfortable in a casual restaurant before. Our server seemed annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted right away. There is also a language barrier with the staff that no one else in the cafe seemed to have a problem with because we were the only non-Israeli or European customers there. \n\nThe service level went down from there. Our food was slow to come out which is amazing to me because when we arrived, there were only two other tables occupied and we ordered sandwiches!\n\nFinally, while we were there two or three large parties showed up and we were kind of forgotten about. I had to ask twice to get our food boxed up and settle our bill."
4,There is an asian pharmacist and I believe her name is Melissa. She is such a pleasure to work with. She is always willing to help and is so pleasant. Although I have another Walgreens closer to my house I always go to this one. There used to be a young pale kind of awkward girl that used to be there and I'm not sure if she's still there or not but I'm glad I don't have to deal with her anymore. If I would have known of yelp when she was helping me this Walgreens would have received one star but Melissa really proved above and beyond. She is great and she definitely needs a raise.
4,"Love this place for all their quality foods, treats, and eventa for our pup. They care about our 4 legged pup and us as well. The owners have become our friends and we even made a few fountain hills friends at spikes events. Definitely recommended!"
1,"I went here with a friend for happy hour.  I loved the appetizers and the waitress was great.  It was actually a nice experience. So why the 2 stars?  Well I had several Martinis of different flavors and they were delicious, but there was no alcohol in them.  I was so disappointed. Happy hour prices should not interfere with how the bartenders make the drinks. I felt it was a rip off. Especially since I had attended a function several months later at the Marriott hotel, and the Blue Martini was there advertising and giving out free \""mini\"" martinis to try and promote themselves. Well one of their \""mini\"" martinis gave me a buzz.  One thing I don't appreciate is false advertising.  I don't drink alcohol very much.  But when I do order a martini, I expect alcohol.  I hate it when I hear of bartenders watering down drinks.  Bar tabs can be pricey, so why not give the people what they are paying for.  \nAs much as I did enjoy the atmosphere, I think I will pass on the Blue Martini. Bu bye."
1,The chix parm is the only thing worth getting.  Everything else is prepared too far in advance like the chix for pasta is prepared earlier and warmed up. Chix parm was good just very thin.  It's a chain I should have known better.
0,"Horrible!!! I bought a puppy from PetPros and they use this vet for a free puppy check up. I decided to go, it's right up the street from my house and my vet (that I LOVE) is a bit of a drive. Once I got into the exam room a vet tech came in and asked me several questions about how she was adjusting ( eating, drinking any loose stool or vomiting etc) I told her no, everything was great but her stool wasn't as hard as my other dogs, which in my opinion is to be expected.. new environment, people and new food. As soon as I mentioned that she recommended a stool test \""because 7 out of 10 dogs that come from a pet store OR breeder have parasites\"". I still said no thanks, I will have my vet take a look at her when I go in a week to have my other dogs teeth cleaned. She then said that she was due for her next round of shots even though on her paper it showed she had a series of shots less than 10 days ago! Said no thanks again. She went out of the room and spoke to the vet and another tech saying I didn't want to do the stool test or shots.. then ANOTHER tech comes in to tell me it's very necessary to do the test now and if they find anything PetPros will pay.. The second vet tech was SO RUDE I ended up walking out of the room. They are total scammers and were just trying to see how much money they could get me to spend! Never even got to see the Vet!! Ridiculous!!! I will NEVER go back.. PetPros should look into using another Vet!!!"
2,"As far as tasting menus go in Las Vegas, i would say that this one does not rank that high in my honest opinion. I've dined at the Michael Minna in San Francisco and had a much better meal there than I did here and considering that it is Vegas and at the Bellagio, I was hoping for more.\n\nEveryone in our group decided on the tasting menu which for the price is not that expensive (4 courses for $98 with a wine pairing for another $55). However, we upgraded our tasting menu by getting the Russian Osetra Caviar for another $75.\n\nOur courses included the following with the wine pairing:\n- Caviar Parfait (Russian Osetra) - Alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, potato cake [Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label, Champagne)\n- Lobster Pot Pie - Summer vegetables, brandied-lobster cream [Louis Michel Chablis, Burgundy 2009)\n- American Kobe Rib Eye - Porcini Butter Poached, creamed corn [Volker Eisele Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley 2006]\n- 5 different desserts including Glazed Chocolate Brownie, Root Beer Float, Sugar Cookies, Brown Sugar Wafer, and Chocoloate Bon-bon [Smith Woodhouse Vintage Port, Portugal 1999]\n\nOverall the meal was good, but nothing spectacular. The Caviar was very good, but probably not worth the supplemental upcharge. The Lobster Pot Pie was the highlight of the meal and I would definitely order that again. However, I was extremely disappointed with the Kobe Rib Eye in that it was not prepared very well - the server said they do their medium rare perfectly, but I disagreed. It was a over cooked and was definitely not near Kobe beef that I have had at other places. The desserts were a nice touch and I definitely enjoyed their Root Beer Float."
0,"i highly recommend DO NOT GO HERE. THIS IS THIER SO CALLED CENTRAL LOCATION.or HQ THEY still use the name THEY ARE NOT AL PHILLIPS.al phillips sold it a long time ago.they have been owned by banks and other companys for over 15 years now.they treat their customers like crap and their workers even worse.if they ruin your clothes(which they do quite often)you need a reciept for the stuff that they ruined or they will not do crap they will give you cleaning credit,who the hell wants credit .so that they can do it again no way .if you work for them and they dont like you for some reason or if they want a friend of the district manager then they will set you up to get you fired, and make you look like a theif.when they are the ones who rip off thier customersthey charge $6.19 for a pair of pants.for that price you have it cleaned 3 or 4 times you could buy a new pair.and what do you get for that price the same that you would get at a cheaper place.the same quality may be even better."
0,"This is the worst hotel on the planet...the cost was ok, but the customer service was not what I expected for my first time in las Vegas!! I would not recommend staying there...It is a cheap hotel (you get what you pay for ) and Employees there do not help you, The wallpaper is peeling off...there are holes and its dirty!! Overall had a bad experience next time I will enjoy another hotel where people help and welcome you when you just arrive after four hours of driving!!! Drink your coffee in the morning people if you know you need it and are not morning people...seriously common sense!"
1,"This place is way over priced for what you get, but the food is decent. I have had better at many other places in and out of Vegas. The breakfast is way too overpriced to even attempt to get something. I ordered a bagel and cream cheese and that was $4.50!! Get over yourself Palazzo, you are supposed to be a high class establishment, but the service we had in the morning was terrible. She was a middle aged blonde, who just was overwhelmed and not polite. We had a large party and had spent A LOT of money this weekend. The service we had in the private room for dinner was much better and friendly, she should take some tips from them on how to act.\n\nI give the higher rating for the night service only. The veggie burger was the worse thing I've had in a long time. The salad was disappointing and Thai rolls were not great. I wouldn't go back! I would say the decor and ambiance is nice especially in the private room."
2,"The experience was a bit rocky.  It was nice to see the place so busy on a late Wednesday night however, it seemed to me no one was communicating.  When we arrived, they told me it would be 10 minute wait.  We waited more like 20 minutes before getting seated which is ok but we had asked for a booth and they tried to seat us at  a round set for 6 when there was two of us in the party.  Directly across from the table was a dirty booth.  \nAfter being sat, 10 minutes go by with no sign of service.  When we did finally get someone to the table, he dropped of bread and left without one word.  We watched server after server walk by without anyone coming over.   A table that sat down after us (across from us) got service well before us.  It had to be at least 15 minutes until our waiter arrived.  Once he got there, he apologized for the wait.  It was smooth sailing from there. \nFor a chain restaurant, the food was good.  The Harvest Salad had great flavors however, needed more cheese.  \nI think I will sit at the bar next time.  May be the service there will be better."
4,"I have been coming to this place for about two years. The staff is so friendly and nice people. The sweetest, funniest owners. I love the $7 option for students. If you are in the area, and want an inexpensive, great haircut. Check it out!"
3,Had a really good time here. The staff were friendly and the steak was good. Only thing stopping this from being a 5 is the slight conveyor belt feel of the large Las Vegas restaurants.
3,"This is the kind of place that you see from the outside and move on. When it comes to food, never judge it from its cover. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. I can't remember what I ordered, but I can recall the the mental snapshot I took for the food."
3,"In general their Thai food is very good. They have a fast and good service. I would recommend their Tom Yum soup or any of their curries. Each plate is between 10-12 bucks, but the quality of the food is very good! You cannot go wrong with this place! \nTip of the day: dont forget to order some thai tea!"
1,"A good while back, I decided to generally shop at Office Depot, mostly to maximize my \""rewards\"" (such as they are).  So I rarely go to either OfficeMax or Staples.  It also helps that Staples is nowhere near our house.\n\nBut when a particular item was supposed to be on sale, and even in stock according to their web site, and I showed up right at opening time, and they had none?  Not the greatest selling point.  I get that web inventory is still not quite correct - though I have no idea why it should be off as the store opens.\n\nAs to the store itself?  It is nice enough, though since I do not shop there, I really cannot figure out where anything is located.  It is a good size, and the appearance is nice, but getting help (as has been mentioned previously) can be difficult, making it even worse.  Really makes me not want to go out of my way again."
3,"Stayed mid week and lack of crowds was fantastic (check in was a breeze, check out by Friday morning was crowded as hell).  We were upgraded, but it sounds like everyone and their mother gets upgraded, which makes me question that actual value of the rooms.  We were in the wraparound terrace suite for two nights, and it was very nice and spacious, lots of hanging out areas, although I'm pretty low maintenance when it comes to hotels, so I'm not the harshest judge.  Balcony was really nice to hang out on; apparently, most hotels in Las Vegas do not have balconies.  While the view of the Bellagio fountains is nice, the fountain show every half an hour gets a bit annoying.  Luckily, the sliding doors were pretty sound proof (not entirely, but good enough).  We had a kitchen, which was a welcome touch, but there aren't any plates or pans, so you can't really cook anything.  We just used it to chill champagne and store leftovers.  I loved the layout and openness of the bathroom and bedroom suite.  I usually find hotel bathrooms claustrophobic and awkward, but the huge separate tub and shower and two sink areas was great.  There is another full bathroom in the hallway, so the lack of privacy isn't a big deal if you have guests over.\n\nSince it's one of the new kids on the block, it obviously appears tasteful and modern.  There are many choices of restaurants and bar areas, and it's right in the middle of the Strip across from the Miracle Mile shops, so the location was perfect -- easy bridge access to Planet Hollywood or City Center / Aria and easy street level access.  Didn't have any problems at all."
0,"Considering I work in the airport, I know lines are long and most of the employees hate their jobs. I get it. But when you ask for no mayonnaise because your ALLERGIC, you'd think to include that part on the note so it can be conveyed to the sandwich maker. Nope. Never happens, the managers are sweethearts, but the employees they need to check into. 4 out of 5 times I get mayonnaise & a dirty look . And sometimes if your extra lucky they will even leave the plastic on the cheese slices for you when you bite into your sandwich.\n\nHonestly the one star is for the managers. If I could give the restaurant less stars I would."
0,Not a good carwash or experience. Only two people working outside. Poorly done hand wash. Not impressed at. This is the third Danny's location I have tried. Over the years the quality continues to go down. I will not be coming here again. To top it off they jeep dragging the air hose over the top of my car. :(
3,Central Coffee is one of two favorites in the QC. Extra friendly staff and just straight up GREAT coffee!!
2,"I love breakfast and I'm always in search of a good breakfast place, so I was excited when Skillets opened and I had a new place to try.  The husband and I were channeling our inner Clark Griswold yesterday morning and getting ready to totally deck out our house for the holidays despite the cold weather yesterday morning.  So it seemed like a good morning to eat a large \""stick to your ribs\"" breakfast, and we decided to try Skillets.\n\nI think I've probably watched too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay because I ended up channeling him rather than Clark Griswold (well I channeled Clark once I got back to my house and started decorating!).  My first thought when I walked in was \""Gosh, who the heck decorated this place?\""\n\nIt was just. so. much. wood....really....I've seen less wood in the rain forest!  There was wood beadboard paneling everywhere, wood benches, wood tables, wood chairs....the place desparately needed some fabric or some softscape to it.  The lights were so bright and harsh, I could have done needlestitch in there.  And then the decor just didn't seem to make sense.  In the midst of all this wood, you had sparsely spaced decor of ceramic hens (which fit with the wood theme), and then ceramic fat chefs (which really doesn't fit in with a country theme), and the floor tiles were reminiscent of a Tuscan villa (which would fit with the ceramic fat chefs, but not the beadboard).  Before even eating the food, I was just a little taken aback by the ambiance (or lack of it).\n\nThe food was okay, but definitely not healthy and nothing very memorable.  The menu had too many choices, yet nothing really exciting.  I went for a boring \""Potato Egger\"" and my husband went for the \""Healthy Omelette\"".  The Potato Egger had their potato casserole with two eggs on top and two slices of thick cut bacon on top of that.  The \""Healthy Omelette\"" seemed decidedly unhealthy even when compared to the carbfest that the Potato Egger was.  It was a huge sized omelette (seemed like 3 or 4 eggs), maybe it was made with eggbeaters, but it was served with a huge portion of the potato casserole and bread.  I think the only think healthy about it was that it had veggies inside.  The potatoes are like a potato casserole (similar to Cracker Barrel), with cheese.  Not my personal favorite when it comes to breakfast potatoes - I'm a purist - I like to actually taste potato moreso than cheese and mush.\n\nOverall, the food was not bad, but nothing exciting either.  The service was friendly, but very slow considering it was 8 am on a Saturday morning and there were about 4 staff members for each customer at that point.  A couple of highlights:\n   *I drink hot tea and they serve Tazo tea standard rather than the cheap foodservice brand, and the teapot they provide is rather large, so that you don't need to ask for more hot water every 10 minutes.\n   *I had a cranberry scone that was pretty tasty - it was sourdough and cranberries with big flakes of crystallized sugar on the top."
3,"waiting on my oil change, i stopped by here mainly because the place looks pretty damn cool. it's like a little ramshackle shed, with lots of shaded seating areas in the back. \n\nyou order at the counter and then pick up in the back. i ordered 3 fish tacos to go and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. and they were only 6 bucks! how cheap!\n\nbut they weren't the street taco size...pretty much standard size! and they were loaded with cheese, beans, cabbage, and fish. i was so impressed, i ate all three by myself!  \n \na definite plus and i'm sad they had to close their shop down scottsdale road closer to us. the grateful dead would probably eat here everyday!"
1,I was disappointed. Dry cake. No place to sit so we sat outside while it was starting to rain. I was expecting better.
2,"I checked out this new Thai place with a few of my yelp lady friends not long ago.  You'd have to be really looking for this place to find it (or be a regular at the ALL NUDE! strip club just around the corner) to know it's there.... but once you get inside, it is a nice looking place; small but good ambiance.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, and everyone seemed satisfied to happy with their meals.  I probably had the most complaints re: my veganized pad kee mao.  The flavor was great, and they added chinese broccoli to the mix (bonus!), but UGH! the noodles were hella mushy.  That's a faux pas you just can't excuse.   Otherwise I really liked it.  My other complaint was that I ordered a lemongrass soda, which was CRAZY sweet and tasted like pandan, with no hint of lemongrass or lemony anything.  Oh well.   Hence, I'd give my food experience about two stars.\n\nBut our server was great, very accommodating to my vegan requests and very prompt with our service, kept our drinks filled etc., so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and bump them up a star!"
1,"Had dinner here, it was ok, nothing special about it, but the food was not bad also. would i come back here? I probably will, if there was no other option. Their food is not really something i would crave, I definitely have been to much better ramen places, but if those are full, this place will do."
2,"Not quite dive bar, not quite trendy bar. This is a happy medium for many in the area. This place still has that neighborhood feeling but always pulls in new faces. Good spot to meet friends for a pitcher and perhaps a game of darts... maybe even a little photohunt.  Its a bar, so come here to drink, not to eat. Besides the drink prices are decent, so you can just have a liquid dinner.\n\n\nOne star because Doc is a super cool guy...\nOne star because of the outdoor patio in good weather...\nOne star because of the prices and location..."
0,"This school is disgusting, I had to remove my children from this school as they were constantly sick and missing more days than they were there. The positive responses are from staff members by the way....."
2,"It's a decent, well-kept park with a few amenities. There's not a whole lot to say about it."
2,"The tea was really good and the appetizer was outstanding. Unfortunately, the main courses were bland and under-seasoned. I think this place is good mall restaurant, but there are better choices around for Middle. eastern. Also, they need to rethink some of the design; the place is already showing wear and tear. The staff are very nice."
2,"Have to agree with Glen S.  The place has dealership prices plus heavy mark ups. Great service, however may as well hit the dealership.  Not really my kind of place.  The service with a smile only gets so much of my hard earned cash."
1,"Place was not clean- tables were dirty, bathrooms were horrible. Too close for comfort at the lanes when bowling next to another family."
4,"Have been to this location now three times and it is always amazing! \n\nThe location is right by the US 60 and is easy to get to.\n\n We have tried their chicken sandwich, chicken tenders, and their chicken and rib platter with mashed potatoes. We have also tried their fries, coleslaw, and vegetables. Their vanilla ice cream is the kind with the actual vanilla beans if you are a fan of vanilla. The food is amazing and the service is excellent!\n\nOur server today was Lynn who is not only a pretty face but one of the best servers we have ever seen. She has served me twice here and each time was amazing! Today Lynn took the time to walk us to the door when our meal was done just to say goodbye,  nicest person I can remember meeting, like ever!"
2,"My husband always enjoys the Prime Rib, and I love their Chicken Tender Salad.  This last time we went, it was around 5pm- much earlier than normal.  This gave us food that wasn't as warm as it should be, we're not sure if it was the time of day or if it was just a bad day.  Normally, they're tasty and good, this time, it was just ...meh."
1,"I cannot believe this place has such high ratings, a line AND a recommendation from my taxi driver. Maybe the rating is purely because of the entertaining nature of it's name.\n\nI was getting my bracelet restrung at the World of Feng Shui during a trip to Vegas and got hungry.  I was by myself and thought, hmmm, let's get some Vietnamese since I'm right in the middle of Chinatown.....?\n\nLong story short.  I waited for 15 minutes.  They forgot to bring my 3 color bean drink (the very first thing I ordered).  The pho was average.  I asked for just tendons in my pho.  I love tendons.  There might have been 3 pieces floating or buried under my noodles.  The eggrolls were greasy and very small.  \n\nMaybe I'm just used to Westminster, CA or Little Saigon as it's known as.  Or maybe I made the mistake of asking my Lebanese taxi driver where to get good Vietnamese.  Or maybe I just should have stuck with Chinese food in Chinatown......"
1,"So within the past year, I have turned over a new leaf on life, and started really taking care of myself. I have gotten back into being active, stopped smoking, and started eating right. To that point I have needed some new equipment so that I can participate in some of the more involved activities, like swimming, biking, and running. Thus my search began to find this new equipment.\nThe closest sporting goods store to my house is this Big 5. Let me tell you, closer is not always better, just more convenient. The only thing this store has going for it, for me at least, is that I can drive here in 3 minutes from my house. As for everything else in this store, I was less than impressed.\nUpon entering the store, I immediately felt boxed in, and I am not one to get claustrophobic. There is merchandise stacked upon merchandise everywhere you look. I mean it is one thing to have extra inventory and put it on the top shelf or something, but that is not what is going on here. I felt like if i got to close, stuff would fall on me and crush me.\nThe first time I gave this store a shot I was looking for a mountain bike, which honestly I did not expect to find here, but i thought it was worth a shot. As soon as I got to the store, I realized that it was much smaller than I expected, and that I could probably find it with a good sweep of the store. Thus, I did a once-over of the whole store, specifically looking for bikes. I did not find anything that stuck out, so i stopped at the front desk and was going to ask, because I could have missed something. The girl behind the counter had 2 people in line, was facing away from the register, and was on the phone talking to her boyfriend. The people in line were getting a little impatient and she was basically blatantly ignoring everything around her, in favor of her phone convo, which as I might add, was pretty sexual in content. I got discussed, told her so, and walked out without looking further. Very unprofessional.\nThe last time I went in there was pretty recently. I went looking for a 'total gym' pull up doorjam attachment, so that I could practice pullups in my bedroom doorway. Of course on top of being unsafely stacked, most of the equipment seems to be just thrown in there, and not really organize like any normal thinking adult would expect. Basically you have to search through every item to see if it is the item you are looking for, because the staff is apparently to consumed with their personal lives to help you find anything, or (what would be better) to organize the darn store.\nI have basically given up hope on this store. I have gone there at least 5 times in the last year, and walked out with nothing, usually discussed by the attitude i have gotten from the staff. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Just drive the extra distance to visit a store like REI or Sports Chalet if you need anything sport related, because you sure wouldn't be able to find it here, even if they had it."
4,"Great food! Great service! I ordered Pork Fried Rice without Veggies. They must have been busy because they forgot to keep out the veggies so I called them back and within 10 minutes the guy was here with the replacement order! Yum! I also tasted my daughters Beef Stickers. Holy cow, so good! On a side note, DON'T ORDER FROM A PLACE CALLED CHINA PLACE. I am pretty sure they don't use \""real meat\"" if you know what I mean. (see my review for them.) I found hairs, small black ones, in their rice, and they refused to give my money back.  Ming's Pagoda is awesome!"
0,"I went into this store in May to transfer my service from Verizon. The \""salesperson\"" that helped me assured me that Sprint will pay up to 350.00$ per line to come over to them (the ad at the time also indicated this). After 3 hours my wife and I walked out feeling as though the transaction went well. I sent in the final bill as I was instructed to do so to obtain my reimbursement. I was told after the fact by Sprint customer care that I was put into a program that wasn't \""eligible\"" for the reimbursement. I have fought for over 4 months now to get the money owed to me with no resolve. I don't understand why this store isn't being held accountable. I have every intention of not only filing a lawsuit against them, but doing everything in my power to let people know what these people are all about. I am in sales as well and understand having to meet a quota, but this should be done in a professional manner. Not by a bunch of kids scamming people out of their hard earned money with blatant lies. This entire thing has cost me over $600.00 dollars of my money. I was given $270.00 and told that the other line didn't qualify because of \""non eligible program\"". DO NOT GO THERE, you WILL be ripped off."
4,"Great food and service. Even though the location is at DC Ranch, my wife and I take the 15 minute drive and always do our splurge dinners here. Last night was our 36th anniversary and Eric our waiter was great. Sunday, prime rib night is one of our favorites, as it is the best value. My bone-in rib eye was the best I have ever had and as always my wifes prime rib was delicious and cooked medium-rare to perfection. Excellent spot for H/H too with the 5/6/7 promotion."
0,This place was awful.  They didn't bring my sides w my good and I asked them to take them off and they wouldn't.  Service was rude and fish mediocre
3,"First time going to this restaurant with my family last night. When we first arrived we weren't greeted with a smile it was more like an \""oh geez, now we have to seat 7 people.\"" Let's just say the hostess wasn't happy to actually work. Anyway we were seated and it was nice and our drinks were ordered and arrived promptly after. As I look upon the menu and was trying to decide on what to eat, I looked at the prices and mostly every dish was over $20. So I chose Barbecue baby back ribs and roasted chicken. I'll tell you about 15-20 minutes later our food came but it was fast. Our waitress kept checking up on us the whole night and I was thirsty and not once asked for a refill because there was always a new glass delivered. Which was awesome. Overall it was a great dinner and place, except for the hostesses attitude. Great place to eat and be served."
4,"Peg and I found out about this place years ago...during an art walk....and loved it. As things sometime happen, patterns change and we hadn't been back in much too long a time...until last night.  OMG!  This is still one of the best independently-owned restaurants in the Valley. Wonderfully vibrant gazpacho, pot stickers, horseradish encrusted salmon, a VERY juicy and not oh-my-gawd-meatloaf-again? meatloaf with mashed Yukon golds and corn.  The chocolate truffle tart was amazing and just right for sharing.  Rose was outstanding and guided us through the journey.  This place is definitely going to be revisited sooner than later....and I would highly recommend it.  Dr. B"
2,"I'd definitely stay at the Monte Carlo again. Room service was excellent & considering it's vegas it had a pretty relaxing atmosphere. Not as crazy & loud as most hotels on the strip. Prices also a plus. However, don't expect much of a view; the city center towers over this place.\n\nAlmost forgot.......\n\nPlease go to the poolside bar and get a Blue Hawaiian, and make sure it's in the football cup. lol. I love it!!"
2,"Cute 50s diner style with a friendly staff and good service.\n\nThe menu says you can have as many toppings as you want on your burger. What I didn't realize was that having my onions grilled would cost an extra buck. The bun was soft and fresh. Meat was a little over cooked for my having ordered \""medium\"" but it was still juicy.\n\nOnion rings were awesome. French fries needed to be ordered well done. It's like In N' Out Burgers in that the potatoes are fresh but the fries ain't so good.\n\nBummer that each sauce you order for dipping is a buck.\n\nAll these little extra charges add up.\n\nWe basically got one cheeseburger, a small combo of fries and onion rings, a soda and a juice and our bill was $21 not including  tip. The 2 sauces and my grilled onions added some of that extra cost.\n\nAlthough the meal was tasty, because of the price, I probably won't be coming back anytime soon."
2,"This is not your Scandia of old.  It's a strip mall store with 9 holes going one way and 9 coming back.  Now, the 8 year old boys had a good time and I had bought them glow in the dark necklaces for an extra buck.  But seriously, $7 per game for each kid is kinda pricey for a half an hour of fun.  We went to CEC down the way and spent a little more, got pizza, and hung out a lot longer."
4,Love the customer service love the fresh food cooked right in front of you just the best. If you're looking for the best stir fry this is the place to be
4,"Our favorite family place to go out to dinner! The people are so kind, even making my son a special \""face\"" dessert! Feel good about eating out!"
2,"It's an airport, a lot like other airports except it has the patina of Vegas glitz and glamor.  Baggage claim is a sensory overload.  Plenty of food and retail outlets at airport and Vegas-inflated prices.  You are never far from a Starbucks here.  The rental car center is off-airport and is an approximate 8 minute shuttle-bus ride from the terminal.  Factor that time in upon your return.  The shuttle buses seem to run frequently.  I travel to Vegas on business so my only complaint is you travel here among tourists who don't frequently travel by air and are somewhat less experienced in the nuances of air travel."
4,"How fantastic is this restaurant!? I guess you're reading this review to find out. Let me tell you, it's the most fantastic-est ever! Hotel Valley Ho describes itself as  \""mid-century modern\"" and \""urban,\"" which you'll agree with once you experience the wonderful architecture, furnishings, and brilliant colors all about. ZuZu is no exception to the theme. From their bar to their patio umbrellas to their coffee mugs, you'll fall in love with the warm, retro vibe going on. \n\nNow this menu isn't cheap, but it isn't crazy pricey either. They feature fresh and local produce when possible, and the menu revolves around classic American favorites \""with a modern twist.\"" You'll find everything from gourmet sandwiches, to burgers, to beef stroganoff, to filet mignon, to casseroles. Great wine menu as well, in addition to classic and original cocktails. The breakfast menu is equally as phenomenal with gorgeous omelets, pancakes, french toast, salmon and more. \n\nLet me tell you about what I ordered. For breakfast, I went with the gluten free french toast which was 100% incredible. It's stuffed with lemon cream-cheese (just a hint of lemon, nothing crazy) and topped with fresh berries and maple syrup. Good god. It was breathtaking! I also had a mushroom omelet which was stuffed with spinach and sharp cheddar cheese... can't go wrong there. I had GF toast on the side with ZuZu's house made apricot jelly. Delish. For dinner, I enjoyed the roasted spaghetti squash. Don't knock it til you try it... Have you ever had spaghetti squash? It's amazing and served atop braised greens, tomatoes, and covered in a Parmesan crust and toasted pine nuts. Does that not sound like perfection? Because it is.\n\nMake sure you come in the evening and sit outside by the enormous fire. There are plenty of couches and the service here at ZuZu is outstanding. Don't miss out!"
3,"Yummy donuts that taste lighter because they are baked, rather than fried. It is fluffier and doesn't have that cloyingly sweet taste, which I really enjoyed.\n\nThe topping are all gourmet. We had the coconut lime sugar and maple bacon, but other good choices include white chocolate mousse, sugar and spice, peanut butter stuffed with jelly, smores, and meringue. The coconut lime sugar is perfect for a quick, not too heavy, snack. The maple bacon was definitely more indulgent. The maple and bacon flavors tasted infused into the donut.\n\nStreet parking in a nondescript location. Prices are $2.65 per donut, $13 for half-dozen, or $23 for a dozen. We didn't know about the prices until after, otherwise, we might have just splurged for the dozen for best value. ;)"
3,Lots of tvs! (great for sports) drinks are decently priced and its not really smokey so thats always a plus! I tried their shrimp mac and cheese. I would definitely go back for the mac and cheese!
2,"Soo this place was just ok for me. Kind of silly the fuss they made about being so busy they only take reservations, no walk ins...well we walked in 30 mins late for our \""well try to squeeze you in \"" reservation and the place was pretty dead. So we obviously got in no problem. Nice vibe, loud club type music, which we enjoyed. Had 2 shots of patron to get our night off to a good start;) $36. Our waiter was crazy funny, and all the staff were really nice and friendly. And everyone looks like a model here, including the bus boys! Dress code is definitely enforced here. It's pretty snazzy. So my husband ordered the seared tuna which the waiter said was very spicy so my husband jumped on it. I ordered the filet and mashed potatoes. They sent us bread and an interesting dipping sauce that reminded me of a wheatgrass shot. No bueno. So our food arrived I was excited, the steak was good. Not amazing which I expected for a 6oz. $40 steak from a place known for steak. My husband, a true spicy freak was sad his food wasn't spicy at all. So he asked the waiter for hot sauce which got us a really dirty look. Apparently we offended him. Mashed potatoes were ok. I ordered another $16 drink and we were ready to go. Got our check, put our cash down with at least $50 due in change and I guess the waiter expected that as his tip? Once again when we asked for our change we got the glare and some sarcastic remark. Needless to say, don't be rude to your customers...he definitely didn't get the $50 tip he was hoping for. Probably will spend our $150 on another place next time."
3,"If you own a printer then you'll know just how expensive cartridges are and this is for a reason, because they are complicated and have expensive parts.  However, when it comes to the point when your old cartridge runs out you can pay a lot less by refilling them, which is also more environmentally friendly and far less wasteful.\n\nFor under half the price of a new cartridge you can normally refill a cartridge from here saving you about \u00a350 a year if you're a regular printer of items.  Simply put you'd be daft not to come here and save your money for the same result."
0,"This is a review of the Lavo Night Club ONLY.\n\nWe arrived at the door with passes for Lavo with our group of 17. We spoke with the door man and he told us that he could not accommodate 17 people, unless we purchased bottle service ($1500 minimum)....as they were letting about 20 people into the club who were not together. We asked if we broke our group up into smaller groups could we get in and and the bouncer said \""No you already said 17, so you have to get bottle service or we cannot let you in\"" WTF!? Trying to force bottle service is tacky at best. What a joke. So we got out of line and wondered over to V Bar, where they were more than happy to accommodate our group without bottle service. Later I was told that Lavo was run by the same people who ran Tao Nightclub and it all made sense..... both places radiate douche bag ambiance. I expected more..."
1,"Food was good, for the most part. Way too greasy and too much soy sauce tho. The waitress had a disturbed look. Too bad because you get tipped based on your attitude. Usually great place but she somewhat ruined the spirit. If you hate your job find a new one and quit. Logical I think?"
1,"Sadly, after 10 years of eating at Lotus, I have to give a negative review.  The crispy rice ordered at an 8 of 10 spice level was tepid, tasted premade with  a few chile pods tossed in for \""spice\"".  The portions are smaller than they used to be and the attention to detail is just not there.  I came for two meals in three days with family and we all left disappointed.  In the past, I felt like food was cooked to order and to preference of spice.  No longer, plus the waiter dissed us when we said we really didn't think the food was to the quality we expected.  Oh Lotus, you used to be awesome.  Next time I will cheat on you with Komol."
1,"How unfortunate that the owner hasn't figured out how to include credit card fee into prices. Be aware that you will be asked of it's ok to charge .75 for the card transaction. \""No it's not ok. I just spent $30 for dinner and now you want to charge this?\""  Response is \""yes our machine charges per transaction.\""  My response is \""where's the signage for that?\""  Waitress says oh it's on that sheet on the wall. I said I'm sitting on he other side of the restaurant. So even though I protested this, it gets charged. Then why ask if it's ok? I can't believe the owner expects their patrons to read obscure signage. If the charge is that important, put it on the menu. Or hire an accountant to help you with how to price your food to include overhead.  On another note, the menu does not list drinks. So again it's a mystery on how much Thai tea costs. \n\nAs for the food, it was ok. The potstickers could have been cooked a bit longer. The mango and massam curry bowls were fairly fresh.\n\nTables were dirty. Windows were filthy. Maybe with the .75 the owner can buy some windex at the dollar store. \n\nThe waitress worked hard to wait on tables. Having to walk around half the restaurant because there is not a pass thru at the counter was unpleasant to watch. \n\nThere are plenty of other Thai restaurants around without the issues."
0,"So you think you can get in easily with pre-sale tickets?  Think again.. be prepared to pay off those greedy bouncers $20 extra for their \""express\"" line.  Oh you don't have cash because you went during the night swim night?  Well too bad, they're going to make you wait 2+ hours in line no matter how full/empty the club is.\n\nI still love the club, but the bouncers need to go.  See my pictures of those assholes for more detail."
4,"This is our favorite club in Vegas.  It is just bizzare.  There are crazy dancers on stilts and ridiculous costumes, and the whole place has a funhouse/circus vibe.  \n\nThe club reminds me of a vintage hotel with lots of windy halls that lead you to different rooms and bars.  The staff is super friendly and are always there for you if you get lost!\n\nAt midnight there was a strip tease, and all the dancers are really interactive.  If you are tired of all the vegas clubs that only play house and remind you of Jersey Shore, then definitely stop by this place for a break.  I didn't have to pay cover on a saturday, but I think we just got lucky.\n\nAlso, there was never a line to get a drink!"
1,"This place is a joke. Their other location was way better. Upon entering the current location you'll find a very open, sparsely decorated restaurant. Oh ya, and a crappy DJ blasting crappy rap/club music. Oh ya, and drunk Scottsdale frat boys. My order (and my friend's) was given to someone else so we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a basic Phily Cheese Steak sandwich. There's also a kid that works there shouting out names of customers running around looking all sorts of panicked. So that's entertaining. If you can handle all of that the sandwiches are actually not bad. I'll never go back because of the atmosphere...until the next time I'm drunk in Scottsdale and have no other choice. Meh."
1,Heard a new Boba place opened up in the Chandler Fashion Mall and decided to hit it up. On the surface the place looked trendy and expensive. A massive collection of flavors and available choices...a bad sign normally in my book.\n\nI ordered a large (smooch I believe it was called) milk tea boba. The boba itself was overcooked in my opinion and there was something odd about the after taste to the tea itself. It oddly made my throat scratchy. \n\nIt is overpriced for the size of the boba milk tea (almost $5 for a large) and was not impressed with the tea or boba.
2,"I've been here enough times to get my free meal (10 times, 11th meal free). It's one of the better places to go if you're looking for a bite to eat near UNLV. While I wouldn't call it authentic Mexican food, it does make for a good lunch. I pretty much see this place as a Chipotle 2.0. \n\nTheir highlight seems to be their pork; more specifically, their pork burrito. It has this savory sweet flavor to it that is actually quite tasty. The burritos are pretty large, too. They could easily be boxed up and saved for a second meal. Unfortunately, I'm not looking to gain my Freshman 15 back, so I have only eaten this once. Their salmon tacos are also a good choice, if you're looking for something lighter.\n\nNow, I'm a college student. I almost eat out for my weekday lunch on the daily. Therefore, I strive to be cheap, but not dollar menu cheap. This place is kinda pricey if you go off their general menu and get a drink. Be prepared to pay $8-10 if you do. I usually go with their daily special, which usually comes around to a more reasonable $6-7, plus you get a drink with it. While their daily specials are not as tasty as their burritos, they get the job done for me.\n\nKeep in mind that this place is right across the street from UNLV. It can get pretty packed over the lunch hour. I've seen the line go as far as reaching the front entrance (15 min wait). Just a tip."
3,"Whoa. This place is just...whoa. Firstly, the tables are really nice. They look like they are made of marble (Are they? I didn't bother checking. Someone find out for me please) and there is a terrace in the front AND at the back. What?? This is a Vietnamese restaurant? Usually the atmosphere is more low key, nothing extraordinary, and very simple. \n\nThe service is good and one thing I should mention is the portion size of the food is quite unbelievably large for a Vietnamese place, especially the bun cha gio. My friend goes there often and she told me the portion sizes here are large, and boy she was not lying. The salad was good a chunk of the plate, the imperial rolls and vermicelli took up half of the plate and so on. I ordered a modest medium pho ga,..they gave me so much meat...I was very happy. \n\nThe highlight of this restaurant, is that they have bo tai chanh which is Vietnamese beef carpaccio. This is rare because most Vietnamese restaurants do not offer this dish. Portion size, again, quite large and came with many shrimp chips and underneath big pieces of lettuce.\n\nThis place is really quite something, maybe I'm overhyping it but anyways,  eat there. The end."
2,"Let me first mention I'm a Vegas local. \nI have been to multiple clubs on the strip, plenty of times. On two different occasions I have been in a group where we have had our phones stolen on the dance floor. This has never happened to my me or my group of friends, anywhere else. The first occasion it was one girl and out of her purse. The second time THREE of us got our phones stolen on the dance floor (zipped inside purse pocket, front pocket of jeans, inside bra). Let me also mention that we were all sober. Within the half hour it took for us to cancel our phones, they had made calls to Colombia and switched my SIM card into 2 different phones. They were professional phone bandits! Watch your phones, guys! \nBesides that.... Marquee has two stages. In the summer, there is the main EDM stage inside and a hip-hop stage outside. In the winter the outside portion closes off and the Boombox room, with hip-hop, opens up. The Boombox room is always packed, however the bar is easier to get to than the upstairs bar. The outdoor poker tables stay open even in the winter! \nGet your name on a guest list, don't pay cover! If you're a group of girls, find a promoter to get you drink tokens!"
4,Best Theater ever! Recliners! Beer! Wine! Enough said. The whole family loves this place.
0,The Worst buffet ever! Almost everything is un-freshed and the price is ridiculous high. It is even not worth 10$!
2,"I tried this place because my sister's coworker recommended it.  The atmosphere is cool,but you might think you're at Hooters because the way the waitresses are dressed. I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger,which seemed small for $15. The waitress did mention that the burgers were 7 ounces.  If you show your Total Rewards card,you get to save a dollar.  Unfortunately, I showed my card to one waitress then another waitress served my party's food."
1,"FRANCAIS PLUS BAS\nto Kristen N.: Yup and they're all like that. In my humble opinion the worse issue with breakfast restaurant are that they use shortcut. Frying rissole potatoes that's one lousy one. Having some industrial bechamel et putting mozzarella for a Florentine eggs is just wrong! You need Gruyere. Of pancake that are in fact american pancake which are way more thick and in my opinion almost taste like Eggo Waffles.  Anyway shortcuts is never the answer, otherwise you might as weel stay at home\n\nCelui ou j'allais est ferm\u00e9 pour insalubrit\u00e9! Et pis j'ai en horreur les resto-dejeuners qui prennent des stupides raccourcis! D'abord les pommes de terre rissol\u00e9es qui sont frites m'insulte! ok c'est ben plus long sur une plaque chauffante mais la chaire est juste vraiment bonne et c'est normalement cuit au beurre sal\u00e9e-poivr\u00e9e. L'astie de base la! Tu veux du bacon? pas de trouble, on te sert le pr\u00e9cuit qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9ja pleinement cuit et tu te ramasses avec du bacon bien trop cuite. Ok et  les oeufs a la florentines; un classique avec de la b\u00e9chamel commerciale et du cheddar. Vraiment! un peu plus et on r\u00e9invente ce que c'Est. De un y'a du Gruyere pas du cheddar, De deux une b\u00e9chamel maison, est-ce vraiment trop demand\u00e9? J'accepte de pay\u00e9 plus de 20$ pour un d\u00e9jeuner, j'Aimerais vraiment que \u00e7a soit dans le respect des choses mais Tutti frutti ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de coup\u00e9 des coins pour servir quelque chose de vraiment juste boff. J'ai h\u00e2te de retrouv\u00e9 un resto-dejeuner qui fait du sens!"
0,"We came here for taco Tuesday. After waiting almost an hour and a half we were thinking, \""well you can't really go wrong with dollar tacos\"".... then La Paz did. I've been here a handful of times and have consistently gotten bad service."
1,"After reading the glowing reviews here on yelp my gf and i tried this place out this morning. The result was not what we were hoping for.\n\nI was deciding between a couple things for breakfast and when i asked the waitress for a recommendation she didn't hesitate to say the Eggs Benedict, which is a favorite of mine so I ordered it. My gf ordered the blueberry griddle cake (read:over sized pancake). I also got a jumbo OJ and she got a rasberry chocolate latte that was a special for the day.\n\nHad we only ordered drinks this place would have been 4 star. The OJ was nice and fresh with great taste and the latte was very good with not too sweet a rasberry taste and better than anything at starbucks for less money.\n\nThen the food came and things went downhill. My eggs were prepared fine but somebody forgot to add any flavor beyond the smoked flavor in the ham. The hollandaise was bland, the eggs were nothing special, the standout was the potatoes but even they weren't much beyond you average ihop country potatoes. I added pepper and tobacco after the first few bites but it didn't help give any real flavor.\n\nSharon said the pancakes were bland as well and lacking flavor as well and only ate half based on how much there was and how she got tired of them after awhile.\n\nThe price wasn't bad and the service was only fair. It cost $30 after tip for all the food so not bad about the same as ihop but flavor didn't make it worth it. The service was fine with the exception that we called for a reservation based on some recommendations and we arrived they didn't have us on the list but we were still seated promptly. The server was helpful and promot and it was a nice touch the way they were all dressed in chino shorts and button up shirts, felt like a nice east coast yacht club."
3,"Great location and service. Gotta try the Sweet n' Spicy Ribs, bomb! The best Nachos in town are here as well. Try the Chili Cheese Nachos asap!!!"
2,"Came in for their new weekend brunch menu for my fiance's birthday but there were only 4 breakfast offerings so we ordered off of the lunch menu. \n\nMains:\nBLT - asked for the basil aioli on the side, which was the only sauce listed on the menu. It did come on the side but the lettuce was drizzled with something that looked like russian dressing, so we sent it back to get it dry as ordered. The bread was good but not a lot of bacon and the tomato overpowered everything so we wouldn't order it again. \n\nStarters:\nBlue Corn Cakes (complimentary) - delicious and super moist.\n\nCrispy Chicken Sliders - this was good but again asked for the buttermilk ranch on the side which was the only sauce listed in the menu but the arugula was dressed with some sort of vinaigrette. The waitress said there was nothing on it, but after we pointed it out to her she said she didn't know. We ate it anyway and might order it again.\n\nGrilled Cheese Bites - the best thing we ordered! It was simple but tasted so good. Would definitely order again. It might be the only reason we come back to try their happy hour.\n\nSpicy BBQ Pork Belly - the waitress described it as crispy and not very spicy, however it was the exact opposite. Really fatty pieces of pork belly soft with hardly any meat and extremely spicy. No one at the table would eat it so we sent it back.\n\nSides:\nMac & Cheese - not very cheesy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Wouldn't order again.\n\nDressings/Sauces:\nButtermilk ranch - pretty good, but an average house made dressing.\n\nBacon mustard - amazing! I would order something just to put that on it. \n\nBeer cheese - did not taste that much like beer or cheese.\n\nBasil aioli - really good with lots of basil flavor.\n\nDrinks:\nWatermelon Cream - absolutely disgusting, it tasted like dirt. No one would drink it so we sent it back. People at other tables who ordered it didn't drink it either. It probably wasn't a good sign that when watching them make it they had to dump it out the first time and re-do it. My guess is no one on staff knew how to make it. \n\nThe waitress didn't quite know how to handle a lot of the screw ups that were going on and also didn't seem to know the menu. The manager did come over and apologize and they didn't charge us for anything we sent back. If we go back it would be for happy hour for the draft beer and discounted apps."
3,I think this place has the best boba drinks. Simply because they use fresh fruit. None of that powder stuff.
2,"I've been on a journey to find some really good Thai food. I was pretty stoked to try this place. My friend and I just coincidently passed and decided to give it a try. The location felt kind of random, there's not much around it. \n\nAtmosphere:\nThe lighting was pretty dim, which was fine. We were confused at first because it was empty and dark, we thought it was closed. A waitress popped out from the back and seated us. \n\nFood:\nI'm not that into pad thai, but once in awhile I'll get a craving. I decided to give it a try and satisfy my craving. It was okay, not \""omg I need to have it again,\"" but I probably won't need to have it again for awhile. They ask the scale of spiciness you want 1-10. I decided to get a 6 so there would be a little bit of kick, but not too much. I didn't really notice the spice when I ate it. \n\nMy friend thoroughly enjoyed his eggplant plate if you're in the mood for something different!\n\nI think I'll come here again and try the curry. \n\nService: The waitress was kind of attentive. It took us awhile to get our bill. We were just sitting and talking, waiting for the bill to come. But at least she gave us a refill on our water a couple of times!"
3,ADOBO FRIED RICE. \n\nCame here with folks on the way out of vegas. price is right and food is on point. tastes just like i came from a family party (filipino style family party) and decided to get creative with the leftovers. thats how the adobo fried rice omelet  came about. soooo good. shared a adobo and katsu with lumpia and it was enough for 3 people!!! (have it be we each ordered the adobo fried rice omelet to our selves not know the size of the portion.)\n\nbetter than L&L but ranks up there with Homesyle Hawaiian out here in san diego. (MO dont worry i still prefer you over these guys)
2,"I visit 1130 often, due to its close proximity to home. But I keep going back when there are often other alternatives, so that must mean something. When the weather is nice, there is nothing better than their patio on a weekend afternoon. Pull up a chair and order the first round of $2 Mimosas. They can get a little pulpy for my taste, so sometimes I'll ask for pulp-free OJ. But come on...$2 Mimosas.\n\nI've had food at 1130 and its never been anything to write home about (much less a review), so I won't. They have a pretty good happy hour and the bar area often gets quite busy (there seem to be a lot of meetings held there, like social clubs and post-convention types). I've always had good service and they at least pretend to remember me, which I appreciate.\n\nI know what I'll remember...$2 Mimosas!"
4,I actually find this place to be better than Hot N' Juicy. The shrimp seemed fresher and larger and the ambience is definitely nicer. The side-dish portions are larger too so you don't feel as robbed for ordering a cup of rice.
1,"Ok so after going here a few times, the owner is very short with me. he hurt me bad, ripped off one of my thumb nails, told me that i couldn't just get a pink and white fill i had to take them off and pay 50 for a full set of glitter tips with acrylic on them. COMMON you know thats messed up. go to other places, for nails. pedicures are spot on. ask for jenny."
0,"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.\n\nHint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.\n\nHint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.\n\nHint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.\n\nI ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) \n\nThe chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.\n\nThey also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.\n\nBut the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. \n\nSo the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had."
0,"I hosted a large party of 14, employees and their kids, for a dinner at the end of a long week of business meetings. Our party was evenly split with kids and adults. We arrived at 7:45, the restaurant was very slow, but we were seated in a corner that would never have worked to seat our party. \n\nBy 8:10, we were moved to a larger table, but some of us had to stand for 25 minutes because the place they originally sat us was so inappropriate. I feel bad for the couple sitting at a nearby two-top that had a nice view of our butts as they tried to eat. \n\nWe had the chips and salsa, adding guacamole, and then cheese dip to keep the kids happy. The guacamole was ok for my tastes with cilantro and jalape\u00f1os in it. For out of town kids, it had too much zing for some of them. I can live with that. The cheese dip was melted white cheese (jack?) with a creamy sauce like Alfredo in it. Not at all like what I would expect. \n\nWe ordered, and the food finally arrived around 9pm. One of my kids was studying astronomy in school and pointed out at 9:21, lights could be seen streaking across the sky. All the kids went outside to the patio to see this phenomenon, but the men stayed inside and continued their conversation. \n\nThat's when the problem started. A busboy asked me in broken English with one hand on my plate if I was done. I said yes. My plate was whisked away. \n\nA few minutes later, the rest of the party returned to find all of their plates had also been taken, quite a few with significant food remaining. A pork chop with one bite out of it. A salad with a large amount remaining. A taco plate with one of two tacos eaten. \n\nAs a former restaurant manager, I can say with authority that when an unusual amount of food is left on the plate, it's appropriate to ask: \""do you want this to go?\"" \""Are they done eating?\"", \""was everything ok with the food\""?, etc. it should give any restaurant worker pause to ask under those circumstances. Apparently not at the old town tortilla factory. \n\nWhen the party came back after 5 minutes, the whole table had been cleared. Children were upset, adults disappointed. My wife approached the manager and said this isn't right. He immediately blamed me for saying I was done as that was good enough to take whole meals away to the trash. My wife said they weren't done and he essentially called her a liar. He did not ask the other adults or children in our party what they were missing. He wasn't present when I said I was done with my plate. But his steadfast commitment to the position of \""too bad\"" is really unacceptable. \n\nI am a business owner for a local business that often hosts out of town guests. Three times I have used Old Town Tortilla Factory for planned dinners for parties ranging from 40 down to 10. (Not counting this dinner). \n\nReading all these negative posts have an underlying theme: management doesn't care. They don't want to create satisfied guests every time. Their inability to resolve this incident has just lost them my business, and I encourage you to try elsewhere. \n\nTip to the owner, resolving this gap will net you spring training like crowds, even in the summer, instead of sparse dinner sales. Well worth the investment to hire leadership who cares."
1,"This is the closest WalMart to me so I find myself having to come here from time to time. On average though, it's not as clean or as well stocked as other WalMarts out there. \n\nThe main reason for the review is that I called this morning to see if they had a specific item I saw in their website in store. I got put on hold- waited 5 mins and finally hung up. I called back, explained what had happened only to get put on hold again for ANOTHER 5 mins. At this point I said F it, drove the extra 9 miles out of the way and bought it at another WalMart that I knew would have it in stock. \n\nIt's not that I have anything against WalMart (though I prefer Target), but the service/quality at this one is such crap that it's not worth coming here."
2,"Fine for what you pay, a fast food joint would cost more, there is an old guy Albert that goes here every day. The place is basically Country Kitchen buffet for the senior citizen locals. Since most tourists would never even go to Boulder Highway."
3,"This place is great! I've been there twice.  The first time I ordered a pizza to go from the bar, and the second time I took my parents for dinner.  The first time I was there, the order got mixed up, but when I called them they fixed it and had a fresh pizza waiting for me when I returned.  The staff is friendly and nice.  I think it makes a great date night or just a place to hang out at the bar.  It's quiet and there aren't a lot of people, so it makes a great place for those who want to avoid crowds."
2,Alright so it was after school and when my daughter said she was hungry New Day Cafe was just staring me in the face...\nI got the Tuna Melt that had alfafa sprouts and avocado. The tuna salad\nis grilled almost like a patty so seeing that was interesting. This sandwich was tasty....\nThe Mango slushy was very refreshing.\nMy daughter enjoyed her french toast as well...\nSo because this visit was better than the last it earned another star from me!!!!
2,"I like this location. It's north central just off the 101 and Cave Creek Rd. It's easy to get in and out, and except for Christmas, it isn't ever busy.\n\nService is about typical. Lines tend to move slow."
2,"I want to love this place. I love the people, and i like the food, and im so so on the location and decor. \n\nIll break this up into two parts, the good and the bad. So the good is the same that everybody has talked about, as the couple are the sweetest people and genuinely want you to enjoy your food and leave satisfied. I mean how many places bring you samples of food for you to try even after your full from your meal? Not many and that gives me the feel of going home to my grandmother who never wants to stop feeding me. Both husband and wife were very nice, especially my interaction with the husband with my limited Korean we really had a nice conversation.\n\nThe bad but not totally bad is the location is certainly not setup for date night or anything more that a super casual location/spot. And its just the two that run the place, so the wait for your bill, food, drink etc could take a little bit as its hard to be demanding of such a genuine gentleman trying to keep the front of the house. Last thing that was sort of a negative to me was that when i heard of a mom/pop spot with Korean food i thought traditional comfort food. Maybe some jajangmyeon, galbi jjim, or something other than the standard fair like Kalbi, Bulgogi, and bibimbap offerings. \n\nI wouldnt make a special trip, but if your in the area and want a good lunch at a good price and time isnt an issue. Stop on by as im sure you will be pleased like so many others."
1,"Hyakumi has lovely ambiance and was quite romantic. The service was impeccable. However, the food was less than desirable. The portions were over generous for Magaro- we are talking 3-4 bite pieces that were stringy. The Unagi was fair. California roll, was fine. Miso soup was good. The Edamame was overcooked and mushy.\n\nOverall for what you pay for I left feeling completely unsatisfied. Las Vegas cuisine has gone down hill in the last years. If you were here for the Teppanyaki I am sure you would be happy. I would not recommend the sushi."
2,"I tried the Tom Yum soup and my husband had the Shoyu ramen.  Both were ok.  The boba tea was better.  Lots of flavors and pretty good!  \n\nThey do offer tofu in the ramen, which I think is unique.  The anime theme is cute.  And service was efficient.  The servers were nice to us but  I think the server uniforms are funny.  Do those poor girls really have to wear those awful platinum blonde wigs?\n\nThe parking lot was so packed on a Friday night that people were parked in the fire lanes!  But this restaurant was dead.  If you need some quick food and don't want to wait an hour for Ichiza, this is an option."
0,Decided to write this review while waiting for my carry-out that is 25+ minutes overdo. This is the third straight time I've had this same exact experience at the same location. Will definitely drive the extra miles to find a more professional pizza hut. Signing off.
1,OMG.... I have been coming to the original location for many years.... Just had some drama at the new location with the cashier... She couldn't understand my English and had to correct the order and was very upset!   Come to find out SHE 'S THE MANAGER!!! Funny!  And to think she's the one training others in customer service!\nI want the business to survive so I hope she improves ..... Or someone helps her move on!
1,All I can say is very bland!  Their chicken fajita bowl had no flavor and their spanish rice was so so.  Won't be returning.
1,"I ordered from Emjay's online at 5:01pm and received my order at 6:09pm.  The driver was apologetic, which is more than what I can say about the person that answered my call when I asked about the status of my order.\n\nI wouldn't mind waiting 1+ hour for a pizza if it were good, but I can't say this was.  The pizza was ok.  The crust was forgettable, the toppings mehh..\n\nThe caesar salad was ok.  Just a bed of lettuce, cheese and croutons.  The garlic bread was probably the best part, but still nothing to rave about.\n\nWith so many mom and pop pizza places in the area, I wouldn't order from here again."
0,"This place is ridiculous. \""Signature\"" Nails & Spa? HA! What a joke. . The edges of my nails were not done, she only put one layer of polish on, and just painted my nails on \""in general.\"" The lady took no care whatsoever in my manicure. She left me to air dry my nails, when my sister called her back to make her re-do it. You would think that she would carefully fix her mistake, but she hurriedly painted my nails  so she could move on to her next customer. The edges were STILL missing polish. The male painting my sister's nails later told us that the lady was the owner. OWNER. You would think that the owner would put some pride in her work! And that's not all. After this whole fiasco, the male painting my sister's nails made the SAME EXACT mistake... And we were sitting right next to each other!!! Are you kidding me?  My sister told him and he didn't even notice. He informed us that the salon has been in business for 5 years now.... Pretty surprising to me. No tip for them. We will never go back to this place. One star? I give them zero stars."
2,Had the Carne Asada Chilaquiles for late breakfast. Was delicious and filling! The restaurant was full so I sat on the bar and the hostess was nice and fast. Prices were ok!
3,Food was great & staff was awesome.  My Mom didn't care for the tortilla soup & sent it back but enjoyed her steak.
2,"I went to the Aria buffet for the first time last night.\nI honestly can't comment on the price, as a friend paid for the dinner.\n\nI was very impressed with the cleanliness of the place.  It was bright, and open, and very appealing.  \n\nThe server was polite when taking drink orders and clearing plates.\n\nThe selection was very impressive.  Curries, sushi, pizza, meats, and LOTS of seafood.\n\nThe quality of the food was standard buffet quality, except for the seafood.  I really didn't care for any of it.  The mahi mahi was cold...not even lukewarm, but cold.  The New Zealand mussels were chewy, and the seafood jambalaya was REALLY fishy.\n\nI was very impressed with the fact that they have so many gluten free options.  Everything is well labeled, so there really isn't much guesswork.\n\nMy favorites of the night were the salad, the risotto, all the food at the Tandoori station (curries, etc), the chicken pot stickers, and the mac n cheese.\nNow, I have to tell you..the pasta was WAY overcooked and it was kind of mushy, but that's how I like my \""comfort food\"" style mac n cheese.  I actually went back for seconds.  \n\nThe desert station was huge, and beautiful.  I only had room for a bite or two of cheesecake but that was good too.\n\nI probably would not go back, because I hear that its a fairly expensive buffet, and I'm cheap.  But if you have $30-$50, the quality of the food is pretty standard."
2,"Lucille's opened a few years back at The District near Green Valley Ranch. This is a solid BBQ-type restaurant with excellent food and very good service as well.\n\nIf you're at all into BBQ, this is the restaurant for you. The menu is large and diverse, and covers pretty much every end of the spectrum. Whether you want steak, pork, ribs, chicken, or anything in between, they'll more than likely have something up your alley. Additionally, the restaurant often has blues bands playing in its bar area. \n\nThe restaurant itself is excellent, however there are some problems. The parking is TERRIBLE. This is a lot shared with much of The District, which right off the bat means that there are going to be minimal places to park. As if this wasn't bad enough, they have blocked off a large portion of the lot for (unneeded!) valet parking. Even worse, an old dirt lot used for overflow parking (which is now needed more than ever!) has been blocked off. Furthermore, wait times can get pretty gruesome during peak hours, even moreso than other restaurants of its kind.\n\nAll things considered, though, this is a superb BBQ restaurant if you can deal with the piss-poor parking.\n\nFood: B\nService: B-\nAtmosphere: B-"
2,Food was just ok.  The place was dirty looking inside so that grossed me out.  I've seen better.
0,"DO NOT I repeat DO NOT purchase from this store. I purchased a Sears Kenmore dryer from this store on March 12th. Did not want to pay  $85 to $90 dollars for delivery so we decided to pick the dryer up the next day. On March 13 we rented a truck ($40.00) picked up the dryer and all was good. Used the dryer during the day on Friday and by Friday night the dryer stopped working.  Called the Sears Outlet store on N Val Vista Dr in Gilbert, AZ and they said we needed to call repair. Called repair, was on hold 30 min and decided to try online chat. Reached an online representative who was just awful. The only appointment I could get was on the 24 of March. I asked if I could be put on a cancellation list, shE responded \""we don't have a cancelation list\"".  At this point I am so frustrated I just took the March 24 appointment. March 24th came and no one came. \n\nI called repair and they said my appointment is on the 27th. I became angry explained my conversation in the repair chat and he said all he could do was put me on a cancelation list. Now it has been 10 days since we were last able to use the dryer and suddenly there is a cancelation list. Yes please put me on the cancelation list. I explained I was told there was no cancelation list and the supervisor I am now speaking with says only supervisors can can put customers on a cancelation list. Wow then maybe she should have told me to call and I could have spoken to a supervisor. Fine we wait 3 more days. \n\n8am on the 27th the repair man comes and states the motor is bad and a fan was bad. He had the motor on his truck but not the fan.  He needs to order the fan and rescheduled for April 10th. This will make 29 days without the dryer. At this point we call the store to find out what they will do. The person who answered the phone said well you should have bought the protection plan. We said This a less than 30 day purchase what does that have to do with it. She said the owners policy is you have to deal with repair. I am so over it. \n\nI call corporate file a complaint have very nice case workers but because the rules for the outlet stores  are different than a regular store the have to talk to the store. I get a call back from sear customer solutions and they leave a message and tell me the dryer has to break down 4 times in one year and in order to authorize a return, and since the dryer has only had 1 service issue they can't authorize a return.  \n\nMonday I called customer solutions and spoke to a very nice agent who listened to my question which was \""Why will this store not honor there own return policy which is a 30 day return policy\""? The agent will call me back after she calls the store. Got a message later that day and was told that the store was not answering their phone. In my mind I realize this store is playing a game and will make the time expire so I am stuck with this crappy dryer. \n\nI am so sick of hearing \""I understand, I would be frustrated too. It is starting to sound like a script. No one has even asked what can they do for me. It is always what their going to do. With this experience I will never buy anything at Sear again. By the way I was a Sears girl all the way down to my sewing machine and car repair. I AM OVER IT!\n\nApril 8, 2014 repair came and said the mount is off and would need to order the part. He rescheduled the appointment for for April 11' 2014.\n\nReceived a message today April 9th and the message said to call repair back. After work I called repair and got some idiot. I entered in all necessary phone prompts and was finally transferred to a repair person. She said how can I help you. I said I am returning your call. She said OK. The she said how can I help you? I said I am returning your call.  She then said how can I help you. I said what part of I am returning your fxxxing call don't you understand. I then said transfer me to a supervisor. She said I can't transfer you until you give me some information. At this point I am so angry I said I am giving you nothing. Transfer me to a supervisor which she would not do so I hung up and called back. Got someone else who transferred me to a dip. After 22.15 minutes I was connected to a supervisor. The supervisor told me the part was on back order and he didn't know when the part would be in. He said I could go to the store and return the dryer.s\n\nI explained enough. You have the store come pick up this fxxxing dryer and I will purchase else where.\n\nI explained I am not spending another dime on this dryer. You have the store come pick it up. Suddenly he can't help me and I am transferred to the customer care blue ribbon team. Spoke to that representative  who said I can understand your frustration and will not take what you say personally. At this point I am so angry I am shaking. She then said my case worker will need to contact the store. I said the store is not answering her and when she calls the don't answer their phone.\n\nI am out of characters and unable to post more."
0,"Please do not support this establishment. They are extremely rude. I ordered a large egg fried rice (delivery), recieved in an hour when they said 40mins, & when I got my food I couldn't eat it because it was very hard. My cousin ordered combo meals & they're food was gross & hard too. I called to make a complaint & a male & female worker went off on me. I've eaten here before so I know how the rice is supposed to be. They both told my cousin & I to never eat there again. I asked to speak with a manager & asked for my money back & she hung up on me. I've called 6 times & they both hung up on me.\n\nThe lady also told me if I kept complaining she would call the cops on me. Wtf calls the cops on customers who don't like their food? They're a bunch of idiots.\n\n**** Do not eat here!!!!****"
4,"This place has NEVER disappointed me!\n\nIt's high quality, good old fashioned comfort food in an incredibly comfortable setting. No matter what you decide to order, you really can't go wrong, but if I were to recommend anything it would be the Beer-battered Walleye Sandwich, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Every bite has the perfect combination of flavors, I have no idea how they do it.\n\nThe cheese curds are also amazing and you must have an old fashioned. I prefer a brandy old fashioned sweet."
4,"Awesome food, that's all I have to say. Soft shell crab was the special for the day and it was the best thing we ate."
2,"I always feel guilty when I write a review for a place that specializes in a particular food, e.g. hot dogs, sausage, etc. and I go and order something completely out of the norm.  Please take that as a disclaimer.  In this case, I visited the renowned Portillo's Hot Dogs and ordered what?  A vegetable sandwich.  Guilty as charged.\n\nOnce I read the description on the menu, I knew I had to try it.  It promised me freshly grilled veggies,  mushrooms and Havarti cheese on grilled foccacia.  The promise of yum.  Unfortunately, the sandwich didn't really deliver.  The positives:  it was large (enough for two meals) and served piping hot.  Unfortunately, I couldn't distinguish the flavor of any of the vegetables.  Everything just combined and it wasn't very tasty.  I think the mushrooms were overpowering.  Again, I get it.  This is not their specialty and I won't hold it against them, too much.  On a positive note, I like their fries.  They were served fresh with just the right amount of salt.\n\nService was fairly friendly.  The drive-thru is efficient although I got a very confused server who kept trying to deliver the wrong order to my car. Bottom line:  I am game to try it again, when I'm in the mood for a hot dog."
2,"A neighborhood joint that we pass by all the time.  Coupons for this place come all the time, so we figure we may as well give it a go.\n\nThe restaurant is split up into two sections - dining in establishment on the left, bar area o the right.  \n\nThey start you off with tortilla chips, salsa, and a bean dip while they get your drink orders in.\n\nThe Husband ordered the Mexican Pizza (Large $10.45).  It's your choice of protein with all the standard fixings of Mexican food piled onto a crispy tortilla.  \n\nI went for the Combination Plate (3 Items for $9.95), and chose an \nenchilada, tamale, and soft taco.  For the most part, you can choose your own filling (a few cost extra) and sauce on them.  With it, you get rice and beans.  \n\nWhen the order came out, we thought they were both pretty generous.  Unfortunately for me, the requested low-fat green cilantro rice and low-fat boiled pinto beans were not replacing the red rice and refried beans I had asked for.  The waiter immediately took it back and they fixed the problem.  (Not sure if it was the waiter's fault or the kitchen's fault, but it was done quickly without too much drama.)\n\nMy enchilada and tamale were both tasty, although the chicken soft taco was a bit dry.  That was probably my least favorite part of the dish.  It made for good leftovers the next day.\n\nThey also have a Lite Menu, specials for those 60 years and older, gaming promos, and more.\n\nService was fine. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for lunch, so no real problems there.\n\nOverall, it's a decent place for lunch when you want some Mexican food.  It helps when you find those BOGO coupons that come along though!"
2,"I chose to come to Bliss/reBar because of its' fun energy and decent food.  Tonight was a special night, \""Dining Out For life\"" and I wanted to support the cause.\nUpon arriving, I waited at the bar for a table.  I had only one drink before I realized the bartender could give a crap if I was there or not.  Seems he was more interested in entertaining and acting like some sissy girl, then paying attention to his responsibilities.  Instead of waiting for him, I walked off to check my table status.  Again, I was ignored and not informed that a table was ready.  Once finally seated, service arrived but was severely lacking in substance.  Highly disappointed in this place tonight but I certainly let my presence be known to the owners.  Only time will tell if they care to step up their game and fire a few people."
2,"Wow! China Go Go does not splurge on their portions. I felt like I ate half a family dinner. Not a lunch special (served to 4 PM.).\n  China Go Go features two price ranges for lunch specials. $5.95 and $6.25 for shrimp based entries. Personally, I prefer the pepper steak, shrimp chop suey, and shrimp with lobster sauce.\n  This is the typical China Go Go experience. Upon ordering from the menu, you pay. If you are drinking a cola, you pick up a cup and serve your self at the cola fountain. The server will deliver your food and plastic utensils. If you are happy with your service, there is a tip jar at the counter.\n  The lunch special started with noodles and duck sauce. I enjoy thick noodles.\n  Then, they served me the soup of the day: egg drop soup. This has been the soup of the day at China Go Go everyday for the last three years. My taste buds would enjoy something different, such as won ton or hot and sour soup.\n  Finally, they served my entree: shrimp chop suey with fried rice and chow mien. The portion could feed two people. The shrimps were giant. No scrimping on quality here. With all the broccoli and mushrooms, I felt like I was eating healthy, instead of pigging out. The fried rice was your average fried rice. I am not crazy over the chow mien. It's like filler on what would be a great album. In all honesty, I prefer Panda Express's Chow Mien.\n  As I said, China Go Go gives a lot for a lunch special. However, large portions do not guarantee a five star review. I would be a fan if they change their soup of the day or add won ton soup at a reasonable charge, and improve their chow mien, which is served with the meal. I give China Go Go 3 1/2 stars, which is good.\n Return factor: high. I appreciated the customer service. If the customer service is great on my next visit, I'll most likely become a fan and up my rating to 4 stars on an updated review."
2,"This review is only for the spa facilities as I did not have any treatments.   The facilities are clean and well maintained.  Staff on hand were attentive to my needs, while not being intrusive of my \""me\"" time.  I alternated between the hot pools, the menthol steam room, and the rainforest shower.  I liked that there was fresh fruit, cold juice, and water readily available and that attendants would bring fresh tea or coffee as needed.  I especially loved that while the facilities were on the smallish side, there weren't many people there, so it didn't feel crowded at all.\n\nAfter a few hours relaxing, I met up with another friend who was in the male-facilities and compared notes.  We discovered that men and women were clearly treated differently here.  For him, one pool was not filled with water, so it was a little too crowded for his liking.  There also weren't the same beverage options made available to him.  \n\nAll in all, if I were staying at the M resort, I'd definitely go back and probably have a treatment as well."
0,"First time at a Rally's, last time at a Rally's. Their fries were good but the honey mustard sause was a weird gelatin consistency. I asked for another one at too looked like brown jello. The \""chicken\"" strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips. The big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich. Fries aren't worth coming back."
4,"After getting a quote from Sierra Aire that was obviously a price gouging scheme, called Legacy because of the reviews here on Yelp. These guys were awesome and prompt. Called at 10 pm thinking noone would answer but surprisingly they did and came and repaired our system the next day and charged us half of what Sierra wanted to gouge us for. Courteous, knowledgable and prompt...not to mention charge a fair price. We will be using them for ALL our future HVAC needs. Stay ethical and keep doing the outstanding work you are gaining a reputation for!"
2,"Tiny little restaurant tucked into the corner of a not-so-busy strip mall. It's a little difficult to see from the street.\n\nThe decor is awful, and is in need of a serious makeover. Super friendly service both over the phone and right when you walk in.\n\nI probably go here once a month. The chicken teriyaki/Katsu plate tastes good, but I get those chewy pieces of chicken (I call them chicken boogers) in my plate every time.  Fish has been a bit bready for my liking They definitely give you a pretty good serving size, because I always have food left over.....I'm a big eater too!\n\nCoconut shrimp is not made here as I've seen them take a bag from their freezer and cook it. I'm sure (although I'm crossing my fingers it isn't true), that the other food may be cooked the same way. Very disappointing to see that.\n\nIf everything was made from scratch here, this place would've gotten 5 stars."
2,"I came here on the first day that i noticed this place was open. The restaurant seems unfinished with only a counter to eat at and open space at the front. i think it's fair to assume that the void will soon be filled with additional seating.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the fast service. In Oakland, a neighborhood filled with fast food, it's surprising how much of the food is just junk food - not fast. It took them about 4 minutes to make a gyro which  is about half the time it takes for the nearby Kebab Factory. Furthermore, the prices are on par or less than the prices for other sandwiches and wraps in the area.\n\nFood wise,  I had a gyro sandwich with an olive pastry on the side. I enjoyed everything except the lamb doner meat which lacked seasoning and was mildly cold). The pastry tasted like a croissant that was filled with black olives. The tzatziki sauce had an interesting taste seemed to be subtly influenced by olives.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm likely to return once Forbes Gyros has more experience."
3,"Went for the first time last night. Had heard really good things about this spot and read the reviews on yelp which are promising. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. The menu is really good as well, very similar to Eddie V's in north Scottsdale, which I believe this is a sister location of. Ordered the calamari as a shared appetizer and it is a really big portion but also very good flavors and some spice to boot. Then had the Chilean Seabass on a bed of spinach as my entr\u00e9e, and as a shared side order, went with the crab fried rice with scallion and mushroom! Food was very well done and as a bonus for me came out very hot and stayed hot! I hate when my food gets cold as I'm eating. So, I definitely recommend Wildfish Seafood Grille for their food, atmosphere, service and their cocktails and wine list offer great pours as well. Enjoy!"
3,"If there's a book on how to run a large restaurant efficiently, serve decent food in a nice atmosphere, and get the orders right, then these folks wrote that book. Even though it's a large establishment inside a casino, the waiters don't treat you like you're a tourist at Disneyland.\n\nThere are, in fact, multiple Grand Lux cafes, with identical menus -- one  inside the Venetian and one at the Palazzo (the two casinos are seamlessly connected). And there's also a mini G.L. serving coffee and pastry.\n\nThis is a great option when you're looking for reliably good food served quickly -- but not in the mood for a) the food court, or b) a high-dollar, celebrity-chef inspired, fine-dining \""experience\"". I ate at Grand Lux twice this weekend (once at V and once at the Palazzo), and the service was exceptional. For breakfast I had the best French toast I've tasted in a long time -- not too soft, gooey, or sweet (made with Brioche). (I rarely go out for breakfast, but for this place I'll make an exception; so many places seem compromised at breakfast, like everything is being done by the B team, which I suspect it probably is.) At lunch, I had the chicken enchiladas (available in two portion sizes -- the lunch consists of two smallish enchiladas, plenty of food unless you are really hungry). The sauces were spicy and flavorful -- a nice dish and only about $11. Hubby had the appetizer-portion Greek salad, also good, and quite substantial. We had a side of fries, and they were good. \n\nThe staff made sure our water glasses were filled, not making us feel rushed, and the time we spent there was exactly right (they keep the music up *really* loud to keep those tables turned... but in a nice way). Compared to the iffy service and cramped quarters at the Tintoretto bakery / cafe near the Grand Canal Shops, this place is a Godsend."
2,"As far as I can see, besides Gordos on the other end, this is the only place that does street style tacos on the Las Vegas strip. But lets not get crazy with the accolades now. These tacos don't come anywhere close to Gordos or even the better places in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Perhaps it satisfies while drunk, but it disappoints while sober."
1,"Exactly - \""Meh. I've experienced better\""\nTake your money some place else, definitely was not worth it. Very average and mediocre buffet. \nAria could do a lot better job than this.. pretty disappointing.\nNothing stood out for me, I'm not a crazy fanatic of crab legs, for all others i guess that would be the only highlight of the entire menu. \n\nGo next door to Cosmopolitan's Wicket Spoon Buffet."
1,"We visited early on a bit of a cool day and the misters were blasting over almost every table and chair in the entire place. After we finally located a place that was relatively dry, someone finally did shut them off. We had some annoying flies swarming us, especially after the food arrived, which was not pleasant. Our server was working for the first day and did a decent job, especially considering that he had clearly not been trained. We only had one round of drinks, which isn't enough to judge the quality of the bar. However, I get the impression that this is a bar first and foremost, rather than an eatery. Aside from these points, the general location and outlay are quite nice, especially for downtown events around Mill. \n\nYet, I would not recommend this as a place to eat. While the food is cheap and different from your typical bar burger, it was a bit on the bland side. However, the small bits of carne asada that I got were very tasty. If they could increase the size of the tiny bits of meat and build the meals more around it, they could probably have some pretty good dishes. The chips and salsa were also pretty good. Our server nicely brought us a squeeze bottle of the salsa to use, rather than the tiny plastic cups that we started with."
0,OCB was good several years ago. It has gone down hill and now it is nothing more than a place for people who value quantity over quality.
3,"I don't know why we need a bigger tv. Not necessary.\n So we really went in there just to get some batteries.  But for some reason, the guy at the door steered us in the wrong direction!  Really, you couldn't point us towards the batteries!  So as we were wondering around the store, of course, my husband see's the 80 inch TV!   I'm sure if there was a TV that was 500 inches, he would find a wall to put that on too!  But now my husband is on the hunt for a big TV Thanks guy at the door of Best Buy!  Over all, I do like Best Buy.   I'm just poking fun at the guy at the door, I'm sure my husband would have went to the TV dept. even if we weren't pointed in the wrong direction."
0,"FOOD POISONING ALERT!!!  First night in Vegas.  ONE drink + dinner.  I woke up at 1am and threw up all night.  When I called the manager and asked for a refund for my $21 dollar dinner he referred me to his insurance company.\n\nDon't go here.  It's not worth your time, or your health."
2,"The food is always good, menu has much to be desired, the service is hit or miss...but for some reason this high potential hot spot never seems to add up to a great top tier restaurant experience."
0,"If I could rate this place a zero I would.  I took my truck to get some smog work done. Not only did they take forever to get the work done, when I got the truck back, there was more wrong with it than when I brought it in. Then it took them the entire day the next day to get the work done. When I would call for I status I was told, \""yea he's working on it now\"", but then a drive by the place shortly after, I see my truck still in the parking lot where I left it. In the end I just had to get my truck fixed again elsewhere."
2,"Expensive food in small amount. Service average to poor despite the prices. Decor ok. I was surprised at how pedestrian this restaurant is in view of the reputation of the chef. I was not even impressed by desserts which i read were excellent. Another typical strip restaurant in Las Vegas: more hype than value and quality. Of my three times there, the dinner \nservice at the bar one late night was especially bad."
2,"It's Mexican on Central - pretty good compared to a lot of other places, but not as good as others. Went with a Groupon and probably won't be back just because the service was very poor."
1,Service slow. Food just okay. Won't come back
4,"Customer service was excellent. Had Chris for our server and thoroughly enjoyed his recommendations. My wife and I couldn't agree on what our favorite dish was. I enjoyed the Marus King Crab and she loved the halibut with lobster mash potatoes. Everything was delicious. We even tried the Absinthe root beer float. Not a fan of the licorice taste but the presentation was awesome.\n(Posted this 3/1/14, but actually dined there 2012. Stupid me, just realized that I never completed the post. My wife and I still talk about the food. 5 stars.)"
1,"Looks like the old Renegades is gone and a new one taking over. The bar area is basically the same...although I think they changed the T.V. screen positions, for the better. I ordered the ChiliVerde dish. I thought the presentation was not good.  Eating the dish out of some small tin bucket wasn't appealing to me. The Chili Verde was just okay, certainly no WOW factor here. The corn tortillas were good.  But the combination of the two just doesn't work. My beer was served in a strange water type glass - a Blue Moon. \n\nThe music was a bit edgy, but that could be because they're trying to attack a different younger market...c'mon guys, this is north Scottsdale!  The crowd is older and there isn't enough of them to make a market for you. \n\nI'll give you until November..."
1,"Orange Tree Imports is a nice store.  It has nice things for sale in it.  Unfortunately, as Justin W. has mentioned, I don't care to be treated like I am only in a store because I can't wait to steal.  \n\nBelieve me Orange Tree staffers, I don't want to go to jail for stealing one of your precious wooden spoons."
2,"Oldest Costco location in Las Vegas, first built in the mid 80's. Just recently renevated and re-modeled into a Costco Buisness Center. Cool format but loses two stars for not having the Food Court, I mean, that's what Costco is all about! I know it's a different store format, but c'mon! Buisness people still eat too! Cool to check out as it carries different things from what a regular Costco would, but just don't expect to get a hot dog on your way out!"
0,"The food was totally gross! We had a bad experience at the one in University and decided to try again with this one, it was still disgusting. Bathrooms were disgusting too."
4,"Love it here! It was my 2nd time there but the first for the rest of the family. Very peaceful and serene. Great photography opportunities. Very educational. As a family of four midwesterners, we loved walking around looking at the beautifully designed and cared for desert landscape. \n\nWe paid about $40 to get in, for a 16 year old, 6 year old, and two adults. Both times I've gone it has taken me about 3 hours to very leisurely walk the entire gadens with a stop for something to drink and relax. \n\nWe saw plants that looked like they were from another planet! We saw lizards too!\n\nI highly recommend a visit! Stay for sunset, it's beaituful!"
0,"The hot dog was big and long. Probably a good 10 inches. Seems like a good deal when you first get it. However, it turned out to be ridiculously salty & soggy. It was so bad that I just stopped eating after two bites. Rarely do I ever not finish, but it was just that bad. Guess size isn't everything!"
0,I'm going to try hard and not be too brutal. Eek or should just say Meow!\n\nUsually come here to pick up some 20 pound bags of Nyjer Thistle Seed for my favorite Goldfinches. They live in my super old and very tall trees that we have both in the front and back yard.\n\nAlways have a difficult time at this location. The inventory is rarely in the same place and they are usually out of the only thing we want. Wow!\n\nService is friendly once you find someone. Then it just gets frustratingly worse from there. Almost feels like we are talking Pig Latin or something.\n\nToday they tell me that the 20 pound bag is no longer an option and we would need to buy several 8 pound bags instead. Just for the record the smaller bags are much more expensive per pound and not something I care to entertain.\n\nDid I mention the person who was emptying a deadly smelling cat box in the trash can by the front door. Even though this is an outside trash can ... IT STINKS!\n\n1.5 STARS
0,They don't even deserve a single star! 4 hours late and no return call after having first been hung up on and then two other attempts.  Home office didn't answer and couldn't leave a message because their mailbox was full. Called another mover!

1,Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!
4,"This was my second time here. Last time I had the three meat combo, mac & cheese,  and beans. Oh! My! Thought it couldn't get any better. This time I went for the smoked prime rib. It was soooo good! The smokey flavor is deeelicious!!! The mac & cheese was almost as good as what I make at home! Super tasty cornbread! And the mini donuts make a perfect summation of an awesome meal. The service Nathan provided was outstanding!  If you are ever even remotely nearby, this place offers a wonderful dining experience that you will enjoy."
0,"Very bad experience at Royal. Indian food is one of my favorites and I was very excited to find a semi-upscale Indian restaurant in a Vegas casino, but what a disappointment. I think we might have made a mistake going for dinner though. In my experience, Indian restaurants are typically better for the lunch buffet.\n\n1. Service- I'm not really sure whether to complain about service or not. We were not really ignored, but at the time we were the only ones in the restaurant so not that hard. I also felt like the wait staff was trying to push me to spend more money the whole time. They asked if I wanted an appetizer 3 times, asked if I wanted a bottle of wine rather than a glass a couple times, asked if I wanted to add sides or extra bread and weren't clear if they would be extra charge. Just slightly annoying. Also my entree was pretty spicy and they kept letting my water go empty (again, we were the only ones there)\n\n2. Food-  I ordered the goat masala, which was one of the 3 or 4 items under the menu section \""specialties\"". When I see this in a restaurant I usually assume they mean these are their best dishes, the ones they are known for. The rice was pretty good. Its pretty hard to mess up rice. The naan bread was also pretty good. The sauce was a little spicier than I expected, but I liked it (and they did offer a milder version). The problem was the meat. I've never had goat before, but there has to be a better cut than what we were served (my dad got the same thing as me). It was some of the toughest meat I've ever had, and there were maybe 2 or 3 bites that were free of fat or gristle. The pieces all had a big bone in the middle and smaller bones throughout. I kept accidentally biting down on them and hurting my teeth. The masala also had no vegetables in it just meat and sauce which was disappointing, to me at least.\nThe worst of it though was how I felt afterwards. I don't want to say that it made me sick, but I spent a considerable amount of time late that night and the next day on the toilet, and I wasn't hungry the whole next day.\n\n3. Price- The reason this place is getting the worst possible score. For two people, one glass of wine each and then water the rest of the time, entree with no appetizer, no desert it was $83.00. Add a 15% tip and you are getting close to $100. I am used to paying that kind of money to eat on the strip, but I expect a certain level of quality and service for that price, and it was not met here.\n\nBottom line is that I am not going back and I would not recommend it to anyone. At least stay way from the goat."
1,"Maybe it's nostalgia, but I remember Arby's being better as a kid. Soggy buns, deli meet, and the cheese sauce is runny and lacking in flavor. I think the gas station nacho cheese from a pump is a higher quality. We gave them a chance thanks to some mailer coupons and I wish we paid full price at the sub shop across the street. The only thing saving this review from 1 star is the service. No wait (obviously, it was dead) but the two folks working were all smiles and friendly, even giving me a side of Red Ranch for no charge."
1,"I came here with one of my friends who lives in Vegas. We had gotten a free drink ticket or something from someone in the casino/ strip.I didn't even know about this place and it's got an interesting vibe, like a Halloween-themed cantina. In any case, we went in the afternoon and hit the happy hour. \n\nSat at the bar, ordered the appetizer platter and some drinks. Food was ok, nothing really special. The drinks were also just ok. They also have a siren/ flashing light thing going during happy hour and it turns off when it's over, which is pretty nifty to know (then you don't need to bother to ask about happy hour)."
3,"I saw the reviews before me when preparing my own. Yikes! I can only assume there's new management now. \n\nI brought my car in for a whatever-mile tuneup. They did a quick check before bringing it into the service bay, found out they were out of stock for my model's oil filter, asked me to come back in 2 days when their reorder was scheduled to arrive. \n\nI told them I needed fluid levels checked now, and would return in a few days to complete the checkup. \n\nThey topped up coolant and oil at no charge within 5 minutes, and said they hoped I'd come back when the filters were in. \n\nI'm going back this week - the filters are in - and will update this review for better or worse as things fall out. \n\nBut for now, I'm a fan."
1,First time I've ever had an open table reservation not honored.  I'm not sure what to think about these people.  I get there at 5:55 for a 6:00 reservation. They don't have a table.  10 minutes later I'm offered a high top.  Seriously?  Is it just me or wouldn't you hold actual tables for opentable customers?  Anyway 6:25 we have a table. Food was ok at best.  The charcuterie plate might as well have been served on an Oscar Meyer plate.
3,"This uptown park is a cool place to shoot photos, chill and walk around late afternoon and evening. i'll take more photos here at different times of the year, my other photos got credited to the Bechtler Museum across the street because the artist was being featured then, but that art is gone now, still a nice place to visit or wait if you are going to eat or visit many museums in walking distance"
3,"Delicious duck-focused resto, with charming service."
4,"I've had BBQ all over the Bay Area and in the South but this was the best I've ever had.\n\nWe had ribs, pulled pork, chicken and brisket.  I couldn't believe how moist everything was.  I didn't use the sauce because is was absolutely but needed.  Its a new \""must stop\"" on our Vegas trips."
3,"I've only get delivery here, so my review is only based on that. \nI find it hard to review Chinese here; most of it just isn't very good. Compared to Chinese restaurants in my hometown, it's not that great. Just ok. However, compared to a lot of the Chinese food I've had since moving to Vegas, it's pretty damn good. \nNow I don't know if this is really New York style or not, because it just seems like every other Americanized Chinese place in the country. \nThings I like here, Mongolian Beef and Hunan Chicken. The General Tso's is ok too. \nNow, the two things that set this place away from the pack, is the fact that they have quick delivery and ridiculously cheap prices. Decent chinese food at panda express prices. \nThey have cheap lunch deals, but I think the best deal has to be the combo dinners. Entree, rice, soup, one crab rangoon, eggroll, and of course, the fortune cookie. This will cost you less than $8. It's easily enough food for two meals.\nDelivery is always fast and friendly. \n*Note* As other reviewers have said, the beef tends to be a little chewy."
2,decent show! the two comedians were good! the headliner was obviously way funnier than the host. i liked the burlesque dancers and added a nice break in between acts. we had $15 tickets so for the price the show is about a 3-4 star but i probably wouldn't pay full price for the show. really liked the headliner he was super funny! the cocktail waitress we had was not good! she forgot what we ordered and we had to wait almost half the show to get our drinks!!  well all in all it was a good show for what we paid and the headliner!
1,"I have been to Burgatory 4 times now and while there is improvement, it is still a ways away.  The part that gets me is that the food sucks.  The menu is very creative but the execution is awful.  The steakhouse burger with the Haystack Onions came out with about 3 onions on it, hardly stacked which would have been fitting, welcome and delicious.  The Jerk Chicken burger seemed awesome with Banana Ketchup.  The ketchup was non-existent and the chicken tasted like it was rubbed in a think layer of nothing but nutmeg.  Even the accompanying chips or fries were underdone.  The Crab Shack burger which has Sriracha Remoulade tasted nothing of the flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that the menu is creative but if you don't get any of the flavors then it doesn't matter.  Service is ok, albeit I have only eaten at the bar.  The shakes are good and the beer selection being only micro brews is nice for the area.  I have been there a number of times and I for one just don't get it.  The only thing they have over BRGR is presentation.  I hate that BRGR serves the burger in a deep basket.  That's it.  The food is much better."
3,"I had the pleasure of trying Central Coffee this weekend.  I had a lot of work to catch up on, and I desperately needed a change of scenery if I was going to be productive.  A mostly straight shot down Monroe Road from Matthews put me at CC in about 15 minutes.\n\nA lot has been said about Central Coffee on here, so I'll keep my review fairly brief (for me at least).  The shop is cool without being excessively trendy.  I like the Smelly Cat on occasion, but it's just too hip for when I actually need to get work done.  The shop is long and narrow; I think this contributes to its urbanite atmosphere.  The clientele was certainly diverse: in the two hours I was there, I saw a mom with a toddler, the standard coffee-shop twenty-somethings, and a guy in drag.  \n\nMy large dark roast was good: a tad watery, but hey, it happens to the best of us.  I'd try it again.  I also hear good things about the Central Shorty.  The best item I consumed was the homemade pound cake.  Such a delicious, unhealthy treat: probably the best thing I've ever eaten in a coffee shop.\n\nCentral Coffee, I shall return.\n\nPS: Parking, etc.  Do what the other reviewers say and park it in the street."
0,"Having eaten at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Philadelphia, I just assumed that the quality would be the same here in Arizona. The food in Philly was pretty good for a sports themed restaurant. Unfortunately, it is not nearly as good here in Scottsdale. My wife and I decided to stop in and watch the World Cup and have lunch. The quality of the television picture was good the food not so much. We ordered the Ultimate Nachos with chicken and an order of fries. The server asked if we wanted the one pound or three pound basket of fries. I said one pound is more than enough. Again, you just can't assume things. The food came and the fries were in a small cardboard tray. If they were a pound, I am going to be the next King of England. Now on to the nachos. The chicken which there wasn't much of was small colorless tasteless pieces sparsely spread on top of the chips. The chips had some cheese on top and very little to none on the chips toward the bottom of the dish. There was no chili to be found. After a taste or two each we sent the nachos back. We asked for our check as we didn't feel like doing any further sampling of this location's menu. We came, we sampled, we won't be back."
4,"I loved this place. The staff was so friendly. Everyone from the hostess, to the bussers, to our server were extremely attentive. Our server (I think his name was Michael?) was very detailed when explaining the menu to us and came back to check on us often. \n\nWe had the Lobster Tempura Roll and the Seared Salmon Roll with Avocado and Tempura Flakes. The Rock Sake was pretty tasty too. \n\nThe overall design and aesthetic was very classy and modern, right in line with the rest of the design at Aria.\n\nDefinitely would return here the next time I'm in Vegas."
0,"We were a party of 5, mid week Wednesday, 9pm. Entrees were fish and chips, Reuben, Philly Steak, Fried Chicken, and a Ribeye. There was not one good thing said from around the booth about any one of these meals. Waste of money, waste of time, should of headed into town a little further and stopped at The Peppermill. It would of been the same price, with much better food."
4,Christine & Tracy from Aradia Fitness are the BEST! They came to our hotel room with a pole and OMG did we all have a blast! We learned some sexy moves and gained some self confidence in the process. If you are coming to Vegas with a group of women this is a MUST!
1,I waited for 2-3 hours awhile back because everyone was raving about this place.. I had the pork chop but it wasn't anything special. Maybe I was just tired from waiting so long. I didn't get what was so special about the place. But I will try it again and maybe find the magic in it.
0,"I ordered chicken curry, NOT GREEN PEPPER CURRY!!\n\nBIG disappointment when I got my styro home.\nThe chicken bits were small and not very plentiful.\nI had to SEARCH for them among the LOADS of green pepper chunks.\n\nThis was like finding your burrito was stuffed with lettuce or your sushi double riced.\n\nI WAS ANGRY.\n\nI doubt I will ever be back, since weekday lunch isn't possible and that's probably the only good deal to be had.\nI should've checked my styro while I was still in the parking lot in my car.\n\nReview downgraded to ONE STAR for the possibly illegal Chinese gal with glasses who struggled with the calculator.\n\nOH YEAH and my 80-year-old German mother makes better chicken curry!!"
1,Service complaint. I have had this pizza before and it is the best value pizza around. However tonight I placed a pick up order and to my surprise the employee said he forgot to make my order. No sorry. No discount. I have worked in a family Italian restaurant before and this would not be tolerated. To screw up an order that bad and cause me to wait another 20 minutes without making it right is ridiculous. Time of order was 730 on a Monday.
4,"I really like this McDonald's location. All of the workers, whether it be early morning, late night are really nice. Heck, I'll admit it, I've been through this drive thru a few too many times and most of the workers recognize my face and we'll get chatting (if there are no cars behind me). \n\nWhy review a McDonald's you ask? Plain and simple, the workers here are phenomenal and shoot, I know I'm a pain when I ask for a 'fresh batch of fries' each time I visit. The fact that they  take the effort to throw some fresh tatters in the frier for me is extra nice!"
1,"I'm being nice by giving the place 2 stars. First of all 2 stars because on previous occasions, we have received EXCELLENT customer service and great food. If I could give this place negative stars for my experience tonight, I would have. Hubby and I have come here a handful of time because it's so close to our house. Normally, we get the burger deal (get a big burger and fries for $5.99). Appetizers are really cheap and there's a chocolate cake here that's pretty tasty too. \n\nWe sat down right before 7pm. About 5 minutes later our drink order was taken (we just got waters). Water was delivered by the bus person. 5 minutes later, we ordered chicken fingers, the Frisco Burger and the Classic Burger. Never once was the waitress nice. Felt like I was Ed Debevic's for a minute (for all of you who know what that is) except this waitress wasn't acting. Hubby goes to the sports book to score free beer. I get a text from him at 7:15pm telling me he's watching the game and will be right back. He comes back at 7:30pm. By this time, the waitress refills my water acting like it's such an inconvenience to do so. Appetizer arrives soon after. We eat our chicken fingers and wait. It's now 7:40 and he says, \""I'm gonna use the bathroom and get another beer. Our food better be here when I get back.\"" He leaves; I break out my Reader's Digest. Waitress walks by saying, \""Your food is coming up.\"" No apologies or explanations. Practically a \""drive-by.\""\n\nAll this time EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS BEEN SEATED AFTER US HAS THEIR FOOD ALREADY. \n\n7:55pm, food comes out. She sets in on the table and says nothing. Normally I say, \""Thank you.\"" I chose to not even waste my breath. 7:57pm, Chris comes back. I eat half of my sandwich before I decide that I've lost my appetite. By 8:05pm, I tell him to ask for a box - - didn't want to waste anymore time. I go to the bathroom and tell him if she comes by, he can order the cake. I come back by 8:10pm and he says, \""Guess she's having a bad day and we aren't worth her time.\"" I ask, \""What happened?\"" He replied, \""She walked by the table and I said, 'Excuse me...' and she said she's be back with another water (not even what we were wanting. He then ordered the chocolate cake and she impatiently said, \""You want it to go?\"" Hubby said, \""No, we're eating it here.\"" Cake comes out 5 minutes later; we eat what looks like HALF of their normal slice and waited for the check. She came back and we paid it and left. \n\nNO TIP. TIP = To Insure Promptness. Not gonna tip for crappy service. I don't care if it was the kitchen's fault. I don't care if they were busy. I don't care they had to slaughter the cow in the back and bake the bread from scratch and pick the vegetables from the garden  - tips are to reward good work, not crappy, half-ass work. If it was the kitchen's fault, then TELL ME. If you're a friggin' prejudiced pig who doesn't like to serve PEOPLE OF COLOR, then tell me. If you're having your period, then taken MIDOL and deal with it and do your job correctly!!!  My hubby was in the food service industry for 7 years and we have NEVER NOT left a tip. Tonight was the first night. He said, \""Even when I have a bad day I would never treat a customer like that.\"" I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and if I every treated a customer like that, I would have been written up and severely punished for bad service. \n\nSunset Station, your commercial is false advertising - if you love locals, then your waitress Marlene sure doesn't. You've lost my business for now and I'll be sure to tell everyone else I come across - check your staff. If she doesn't want her job, hire someone else. \n\nBy the way, the manager on duty conveniently checked up on everybody's meal except for me. Maybe she knew they screwed up in the kitchen and was too embarrassed to admit they they were busy and their staff isn't trained to handle a crowd. \n\nI won't be back."
4,"I finally get back to town after my month-long trip and head out to eat, only to be underwhelmed by a restaurant that everyone on this site loves.\n\nDay two back from vacation: I've gotta make up the debacle from the night before to the hubby.  So, despite an inch of rain falling during the time it took us to drive from Van Buren to Bethany Home, we decided to keep going up to the Phoenix City Grille.  And I'm so glad we did.\n\nI had been here a few times, thanks to the corporate overlords of the funeral home I worked at just up the street.  But, at the time I was a vegetarian and not astounded by the menu (embalming and meat eating just don't mix in my eyes).  Thankfully, I gave up my veggie tendencies, because the food here is incredibly delicious.\n\nThe husband loved his burger sans bun and claims that it was the best burger ever.  SCORE!  \n\nOh yeah, and my meal was phenomenal too.  Super juicy pan-fried chicken and horseradish mashed potatoes.  The horseradish had no kick to it, but the flavor was definitely there.  I suppose if I could offer advice to the awesome chefs at PCG, I would suggest adding a splash of horseradish on top.  But I really love that sinus-clearing sensation of good, fresh horseradish.  Regardless, the meal was fantabulous.\n\nThe service was wonderful and the atmosphere is calm and cozy.  The menu is a smidge pricey, I won't be making a habit out of PCG, but it will be one of my reward restaurants."
0,"I called because I saw the good reviews on yelp. However, I completly disagree. I found them to be very uneducated on the topic of remodeling. He seemed confused at everything I showed him I wanted done. We will be moving forward with another contractor. The cost is also way above what it should be. Very diasapointed since many yelpers gave such high reviews."
4,"Came here with family. All was delicious. I had read one review mentioned soggy vegetables.  Well they must've read the review, they were cooked perfectly. I had the coconut curry bowl and it was good. Not your typical hawaiian-style curry, but it was very good. Everybody else had the chicken tenders. They were very crispy and moist. But you have sauces you can dip the chicken in. We're used to the marinated-style m ochiko chix. But it seem that everyone enjoyed it. I would recommend you give it a try.  I will be back again when I start craving the Mochiko"
4,I came here last night to visit a friend of mine at work and was surprised and happy to find that this place was actually quite a rare find. All the staff were extremely friendly including the manager (who is insanely tall btw). The chefs that work at the bar are the absolute best though. From working in kitchens at several restaurants I can tell when people work well together and these guys definitely had some flow. \n\nI had the AYCE sushi buffet. The sushi was great and I like that they had pork belly on the appetizer menu which was delicious. My favorite thing that I had was the 10k roll which isn't on the menu but one of the chefs own creation. \n\nOverall 5 stars for great friendly and timely service as well as great food! I will definitely be back again!
4,"We got married April 2014, and our experience was wonderful. Our relatives were amazed at the wonderful Job that was done. Thanks again for making our day so special and memorable!"
3,"I'm  a regular shopper here.  The interior and exterior are so much  more appealing than the old Cub Foods that was here. Fantastic deli and quick meal selection. Good bulk food section, wide variety of 'local' food stuff. Never crowded, pleasant employees.  Only negative is price."
4,"I've had too many crappy hamburgers/lousy pizza slices while on layovers in airports.  Thought I'd try this as a change.  Ordered the scallops on top of risotto.  Amazing.  Scallops were done just right; risotto could not have been better.  Having cooked risotto myself, I know what a pain it is to make; theirs was perfect."
4,"Great old fashioned breakfast, nothing fancy just good ol' stick to your ribs grub. Good people working there to... I'm a regular now for sure."
3,"One of the bests hot yoga studios in Montreal. The classes and teachers are great, the changing rooms are soooo spacious (including plenty of shower cabins, finally!!) and it's right next to the Peel metro station. A bit pricey but all yoga studios are anyways.. Try the intro week - you're going to love this place!"
0,"The food is ok nor more then that,and the coffee is good , but the SERVICE IS SO BAD that ill never repeat that mistake!\nAfter you talk with the manager here you understand why all the employees don't give a SH.. About your requests.\n Bad name for illy brand."
4,"Made reservations & got right in when we arrived. Service was fast & efficient-and Desiree, our server, always had a smile. We had our favorites-soup, salad, breadsticks, eggplant parmigiana and lasagna. They were amazing as always. We were stuffed and even had leftovers (yum). The manager, Sherry, came by and sincerely asked how we enjoyed our meal (which I like because it shows they care). The restaurant was filled as we left so we were glad we had early reservations!  Would definitely go back!!"
4,I love me some Sloppi Jo...and her food and bacon cupcakes!\n\nThis truck needs to rove around town some more!
3,"Go for the drinking atmosphere, not the food!\n\nGreat neighborhood drinking spot. Big porch with many TV's and corn hole.  I don't think I've been inside with the exception of using the restroom.\n\nWednesday night Trivia at 8 pm is always a good time. Great beer specials (all draughts $3) and burgers are half priced, though, I don't think they are that great.\n\nParking is usually a pain, but you can get away with parking across the street.\n\nAgain, this is a fun place to grab a drink with friends, but I wouldn't expect a delicious meal."
1,"Yes, they have a lot of beers on tap and that's why I gave it 2 stars. Otherwise, food was not good and the service was awful. Unless your going for the draft beer I would skip yard house. There are tons of restaurants in the area with better food, better service and beer on tap."
3,"Subs, Heroes, Hoagies call them whatever you want The Steak and Hoagie Shop has the best hoagies in Charlotte. This is a Greek restaurant and sandwich shop where they make their bread fresh.  The bread is so warm, soft and full of flavor that it is the perfect compliment to the fresh meat and ingredients that makes these hoagies so good.  You can also get Gyro's, Panini's and other Mediterranean style food here, but the best things to get are the hoagies.  My personal favorites are the New Jersey, which is very similar to a Philly Steak and Cheese, except it has better cheese, more onions, a delicious olive oil.  And the Italian, which combines the fresh bread with delicious meats and a great olive oil sauce, to make the perfect hoagie; big, full of meat and cheese (on the Italian they use provolone, my favorite) and delicious.  If you like hoagies then you need to try this place, they have several locations around Charlotte, but my favorite is the shop on Eastway.  Get a half gallon of sweet tea, and you are ready to have the best lunch ever."
4,We had a great time last Tuesday at the Gordon Biersch  Tapping party. But to be honest we never had a bad experience at Gordon Biersch  we been to the brunch and we  also had dinner there. The food was great and the staff very friendly. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone.\n\n\nMichael & Marcella
3,"I came early before a CMYE started and was starving. I didn't want to get something heavy so I got a small Mac N Cheese. I normally don't like Mac, but for whatever reason I was feeling it today. It was fairly good, really white cheddar. It did it's job, but I like their sandwiches/salads better. \n\nIs it the best sandwich/salad/etc at that pricepoint? No, but it's a quick, fairly healthy stop. 3.5 stars"
0,I will never eat here again. I got corn beef and hashand it was like eating cat food. My friends toast came out burnt and 20 minutes after we ordered. The butter on the toast was just a squeeze butter. The chicken fried steak was absolutely horrible. It was just bread. Then to top it off as we were checking out the hostess didn't understand the fact that I wanted to do half cash half card. She just charged it's all on to my card. Every one was VERY disorganized.  I've heard some great things about this place. But my experience was very shitty. I will not be returning.
4,"I enjoy going to Mimi's (on Durango), we go every other weekend.  The service is usually good, the food is generally great, I especially like going there for breakfast (the bacon is always great).  Usually if I don't like what I was served, it wasn't because the food was wrong, it was because I didn't like that item until I tried it.  They have messed up once or twice, but in my experience the only restaurants that get everything right every time cost $150 per person.  If I had any complaint it would be that they don't add new items enough.  When you go as frequently as I do, you tend to burn through the menu."
1,"they've been better the last two times i went through the drive thru bu if you order more than one item and gawd forbid it's a coffee drink ,they will screw it up. there are much better places, imo.."
2,"We have been here a number of times and I really like the food and beer selection but the service, frankly, sucks.  If I could look past the service this would be a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but again the service consistently sucks. \n\nLet's review the service first and just get this out of the way. Tonight we came in and it was moderately busy so we sat/stood at the bar.  We all ordered beers (at least 3 on their draught list were kicked but still on the chalk board. How hard is it to erase a chalk board?) and our friends ordered a pizza.  The wait wasn't long for the pizza but when the kitchen brought out the pizza they just set it on the back bar. And there it sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender and servers walked by it and wouldn't make eye contact with us.  Finally my friends were served their lukewarm pizza after we pointing out that it was there.  No apologies or acknowledgment of an issue were given. When it started to clearing out we moved to a table and had some more beers. At the end of the night a friend had to leave early so he cashed out his tab.  After our friend had left the bartender came over and stated that he had given our tab to my friend whom had left so we would need to pay his which was much larger.  He stated that we could just get the money back from our friend for the difference later on.  Once again no real apology was given.  I am really not sure how his mental error became my problem but it seems kind of ridiculous that I became responsible for it and it isn't like there is a manager on duty to deal with.\n\nOnto the good stuff.  The pizza is well above average and my wife especially loves the buffalo chicken pizza. The wings are some of the best in town.  Fried crisp and sauced properly.  The beer list is also one of the best in the east end.  They boast around 20 taps and the selection is always unique and well rounded for even the most demanding beer guy or girl.\n\nBottom line, I'll come back. But I know that service will probably continue to suck and that I really have to be proactive as a customer when I am there."
4,"Like the decor- it's fun and has all these little humorous signs posted for your entertainment.  It has been newly renovated to expand the front area to include more seating.  I like that there are many different selections of hot sauces for your enjoyment.  That was unique.  The food is good and the prices are awesome!! I went in on a Friday afternoon when there was $1 Fish tacos.  Tacos were delicious. It's the more authentic flour tortilla rounds and comes with an abundant helping of the condiments of onions, cilantro, cheese, lettuce, etc.  I also tried the potato taco which was hearty but really delicious.  For the price and being located near UNLV,  I was surprised not to have to wait for service.  The food is made as you order- but it didn't take that long to get my food and there was not a line. \nI would definitely recommend going there, especially if you need to use the internet as well. There's free wi-fi!! Doesn't get better than that!! They serve some beers as well!!"
3,Amazing breakfast and coffee. Hidden gem.
2,"Went here after returning from Hawaii and kinda missing the food. \n\nThe food here is sub-par. I found it to be bland and like another reviewer said, cheap. I didn't think it was anything spectacular, hence the 3 stars. \n\nAlso, the water service bothered me a bit as well. The water comes from a pitcher instead of through the soda dispenser. It was a bit off putting. \n\nHowever, this place is cheap, so for the price it was warranted."
2,"Good for window shopping, but not much else. Sleepy Poet may have bit off more than it could chew in classifying itself as an antique mall. First appearances lead me to believe that it's more of an artist commune and clothing store. I was overwhelmed with and slightly disappointed in the volume of finished 'artsy pieces'.  I've been to a number of antique malls that have successfully incorporated both handmade art and antiques - but the Poet seems to lean too heavily on the handmade art. With that being said, they do have a large quantity of vintage clothing pieces, but that and their free popcorn will not get me through the door again.\n\nThe staff are nice and I did find one small item to purchase (vintage military duffle bag), but price-wise I could have done much better online for the condition. Also use caution if you're needing to use a store supplied shopping cart to carry your potential purchases. With narrow aisles and a number of booths filled with large items that that stick out, I found myself bumping into things that could have been potentially costly to me. My hubby and I abandoned our cart mid-way through our visit for fear of knocking something or someone over.\n\nPrices for a few other items that caught my eye were in the upper moderate to high range which made me think twice about buying anything else. Usually, when I see a piece I have to have and know it's a good value - I get it. Not in this case since I found myself checking the price before falling in love with anything. I also found that there appears to be a few vendors that have similar booths set-up here as well as other local antique malls I've visited - however the prices appeared higher at the Poet. Not sure if they felt the need to raise their prices due to the location. \n\nHandmade art pieces and vintage clothing, yes ...reasonably priced antiques, not so much."
3,"A real mom & pop Korean restaurant.  Good panchan, and an extensive selection of down-home Korean dishes.  The prices may seem a bit high when compared to the decor, but here you're paying for the quality of the food, not the ambiance.  And in my book, taste beats ambiance any day. \n\nI recently tried the Bibim Nang Myun, a cold buckwheat noodle dish.  It sounded intriguing, and just the thing to hit the spot on a hot June evening.  The \""broth\"" was served as frozen flakes shaved over the top of the noodles, which was cool just in itself.\n\nThe owner came over to talk to me about the meal, & I learned that it was really a traditional winter dish -- the cold soup used to balance the cold outdoors apparently.  But also where (and when) else could you freeze your broth back in the days before freezers, anyway?"
2,"OK.  A mixed review.  The wife and I did our normal thing at Farmer Boys and split a Farmer's Club Sandwich meal.  As usual, the sandwich, fries, and soda pop were all excellent.  Unfortunately, there are the usual problems:  the meals are all too big and the prices are too high.  As I noted, above, the wife and I split that meal (1033 calories for the sandwich and 514 calories for the fries) and it works out fine, that way.  I can't imagine how a single person eats at Farmer Boys:  maybe with a kid's meal.  The single meal cost us $12.64.  That's just too much money for a sandwich, fries, and a soda pop at what amounts to a slightly upscale fast food restaurant.  There are also a couple of other issues with this location.  First, it's darn cold in there.  They have long vents along the outside of the eating area that blow cold air directly down on the people seated in the booths.  If there were some kind of diffuser or re-director on those vents, it would be fine.  But, with the direct air flow, it's just too cold.  Second, even though I've already complained that the meals are too big, my piggish self wants to say the amount of fries we got was a bit small (though they are really good).  And, finally, it's noisy as heck in there.  It's noisy enough that it's hard to be heard at the ordering counter as well as being miserable in the eating area (and that's a hint to people who bring their screaming kids into a restaurant and just let the kids continue screaming throughout the meal).\n\nSo, overall, really good food (though too much of it) at too high a price for a not very pleasant dining experience.  Three stars out of 5."
1,"Stayed here in the past, the rooms are okay, pretty cool features that make the room seem state of the art, i did miss that stuff when i stayed at the other hotels in vegas. but the hotel itself is very bland, nothing exciting going on, nothing special to eat or visit or do.. and it's KINDA off the strip, for it's price I would have expected something better..I think i can only justify it's higher prices for now because it's new."
4,"I am naturally suspicious of any restaurant that features ginormous menus. This place has not one giant menu, but two! Chinese (Szechuan), and Japanese. We ordered sushi from one, and Singapore noodles and Hand Pulled Noodle Veggie Soup from the other. WOW. Everything was amazing!\n\nSushi: we got the spicy tuna roll ($5.95), a spicy scallop roll ($5.95), and one specialty roll: \""The Hot Babe\"" - Tuna, cucumber and Jalape\u00f1o inside, topped with shrimp and special sauce ($12.95). All of them were fantastic, and we were both in agreement that the spicy scallop was our favorite. Not too much rice, just perfect.\n\nThe Singapore street noodles ($9.95) were seriously the best we have ever had in town (and trust me, we have tried these at no less than 12 Madison establishment) - kind of an obsession, perhaps? At some places they overload with curry and salt, but at VIP the flavors are perfectly balanced, and the dish is chock full of shrimp, chicken and beef. Happily, thanks to the giant platter of sushi we started with that filled us up, we took have the noodles home for later.\n\nWe confirmed with our friendly waitress (who checked on us regularly and happily explained menu items and gave us her suggestions), that the \""hand pulled noodles\"" were indeed made right there at VIP. Sold - we got the vegetable hand pulled noodles ($7.95) which was a giant bowl of soup. The broth was light and flavorful, and the noodles...oh, the noodles!! Clearly fresh, chewy and delicious! Happily again, we brought half of it home for later!\n\nOur bill arrived with the same yummy guava hard candies that Ha Long Bay offers. Love those little guys! Other reviewers have mentioned the decor/ambiance. Very cool place - and the dishes and tea cups are so adorable! Though the soy sauce bowl for the sushi was almost identical to my tea cup, and I almost plunged my spicy scallop into my green tea! Stopped myself just in time. They also had quite an extensive drink/cocktail/sake/wine menu, which I hope to try on a future visit (which will likely be VERY SOON!!!!!)."
3,The White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate is delish!!!  And I don't even like desert-y type drinks.  The regular and Oreo Cookie frozen hot choclates were pretty good too!  A great way to cool off on a very hot day exploring the strip.
4,HUGE Thank You to David Flores! My car has always had transmission problems and when I knew the big break down was coming again I had no other choice but to go to the dealership. As a 21 year old female going to a dealership is about as fun as going to Home Depot with Dad. Thankfully my Mother drove over three hours just to go with me. As I pull up to the dealership I saw how hectic and busy all the workers were and immediately thought the worst. That's when David came up to my mother and I.. I can't say thank you enough. He has completely changed my perspective on dealerships. \n\nWhen I finally decide to buy a new car I will only buy one from this dealership because of him and the service he has provided. He went well over above and beyond what I could have expected from anyone. This is a huge relief to me and to my family because they live so far away from me. I know if I ever have a problem I can call David and he will take care of me. \n\nI cannot thank you enough! You guys have got the best Service Advisor out there. I will forever be a loyal customer to Chapman.\n\nThank you so much David!
2,"They stopped having UFC fights on a regular basis, so won't be frequenting as much. I'm not happy about it but i guess times are hard. It's a shame :( I wish them success & maybe we'll be back again one day soon!?!?"
0,"Total Tourist Trap!!!\n\nIf you are looking to establish a relationship with a local gun shop/shooting range, this is NOT the place for you.\n\nI bought 3 firearms through BudsGunShop.com and decided to go with this FFL dealer because of their great Yelp review.  BIG Mistake!  They were condescending and refused to initiate the transfer for no particularly good reason besides their own judgements and discriminations.  Since I bought the big ticket items online, they didn't see me as a cash cow.\n\nI also heard one of the trashy looking girl attendants chatting with a customer about how they're one of the few gun shops in town so it's more about how much revenue they can get off a customer than establishing good rapport since they're not hurting for foot traffic.  I couldn't believe my ears!\n\nThe other attendants walk around with guns in their holster acting like wannabe cops.  No one even cracked a smile or a friendly greeting!\n\nI called BudsGunShop.com and initiated a refund so I hope they're competent enough to have shipped the firearms back properly, but I'm definitely NEVER coming back here nor recommending this awful shop to any of my friends."
3,Happy Hour Everyday 2-5pm .. half price drinks n slushes ..
3,"Ok how cute is this place? Took me forever to figure out to pronounce the name but it's adorable inside. A very man friendly, hipster-free yet still hidden enough to be cool kind of vibe. Restores pieces make up the furniture and the guys running the shop seem super down to Earth. Checked in a four square after buying my very reasonably priced drink and found they have a BOGO special. They let me use the special with my friend who arrived 10 minutes later. Hello, free coffee for her!\nI got the iced mocha and it was great. Not too strong in the coffee side, just the way I like it. Located in the \""basement\"" of the Vue it's got a super location an I hope it does well with college kids. The prices speak for themselves. I'll be back for sure and hopefully I'll be hungry. I mean a sandwich called \""the southern\""? Yeah, I'm eating it."
4,Not sure why my review for Italian Restaurant ended up under Pizzeria Bianco so I want to fix this. Love pizzeria Bianco but go for lunch. Dinner is way too busy.
4,"I love roller coasters! I don't scare easily and X-Scream is the ride which has come the closest to defeating me!\n\nX-Scream is one of the thrill rides perched on the top of the Stratosphere Tower, which is the tallest tower west of the Mississippi. The height of the rides turns some fairly ordinary rides into real terrors\n\nThe first experience most people get of X-Scream is when their silent contemplation of the view from the indoors lower observation deck is rudely interrupted by a loud bang, some screaming followed by the sudden appearance of some people hanging over the edge of the tower, seemingly about to plunge several hundred feet to their deaths!!\n\nX-Scream is a simple ride - a see saw along which travels a car. You get on when it's at the back, then the see saw tilts forward and you rush down the track and it looks like you're going to plunge over the edge. The see saw then tilts up and down and the car moves but it's the first plunge which makes sudden religious converts of most people as they contemplate sudden death!\n\nYou access the ride from the upper observation deck. Coming into the open adds a sense of raw reality to the ride\n\nThe first time I came up the tower, I actually couldn't make myself get on the ride and I had returned to the bottom of the tower when I forced myself up again and onto the ride!\n\nTry it if you dare!!!"
0,"The decor is is beautiful.   But that's about it.  Service here is horrible,  everyone is so unhappy.   If you are unhappy , you shouldn't be in this industry.   All I had was a sangria (which the server never asked me which one I wanted) and old chips and salsa.   Never again."
2,"Yoforia delivers fro yo to the masses in Southpark Mall. It's a self serve spot with 12 flavors. Unfortunately, two were down for cleaning when I visited. You can sample as many flavors as you like but you need to ask the people at the counter for the cups. They keep them hidden, probably to deter people from just snagging samples and leaving without a purchase. \n\nI sampled a few and enjoyed most of them. Most of the ones I sampled had a really nice, smooth consistency (read, not icy!). They had a nice mixture of sweet and tart flavors. They had 4 tart flavors out of the 10 they were serving at the time Which is more than most places offer. The thing that got me... TARO fro-yo. Oh yum yum!! It was a nice consistency, which an appealing purple hue. The taro flavor was mild but ever present. I also enjoyed the key lime and cheesecake swirled together.\n\nLike most self-serve fro-yo places, they only have one size cup (large!). So, be careful filling it up. Otherwise, you will, very easily, have an $8+ cup in your hands. The toppings bar was messy and the fruit didn't look all that appealing. I opted to pass on toppings, as the taro was good all on its own.\n\nSo, my biggest complaint... Price! I know they have to pay the rent, which is probably outrageous being in a mall, but come on! They charge about 10 cents more per ounce than comparable self-serve fro yo places. Oh well... I'll be back just for the taro fro-yo."
0,My one experience at this gym was bizarre and uncomfortable. Staff was unprofessional and unwelcoming.  They claim to give off a non- judgement vibe.... Funny because I've never felt so judged and uncomfortable @ a gym in my life!
2,"The owner did send me a very apologetic message almost right away and looked into our complaints. I can tell this restaurant has a lot of pride in their food and doesn't usually have these types of mishaps, and I appreciate that they took this seriously. Given the other glowing reviews, I think our experience was an outlier, and I would recommend you to try Les Deux Gamins and of course, let the management know if anything isn't up to par. It seem that they'll do their best to make it right."
3,"I came in for an oil change $42 which seemed a little high, however there are coupons on the jiffy lube site. I posted the link the $15 coupon at the bottom of this review. \n\nThe first guy I talked to kind of seemed like a DB and was rushed to get me taken care of, maybe because he wanted to focus his attention on the young attractive girls who were behind me. They quoted me an hour wait which I guess is becoming pretty standard these days, although they didn't look that busy. They seemed kind of disorganized and didn't even ask for my name or information???? I left unimpressed and came back in an hour to pick up my car. \n\nI was ready to give this place a 2 star rating but wanted to make sure I had the full experience before judging them. When I returned, they had my car ready and took my coupon to drop the price to $27. In addition to changing my oil they checked all the fluids, washed the inside of my windows, vacuumed my floors, put more air in my tires, checked my belts and wiper blades and probably other things I am forgetting. \n\nThe guy behind the counter (not the semi DB from earlier) then blew my mind by saying that my car was in good shape and didn't need any additional work. I was a little confused about having my first oil change where I was not told my car would explode at any moment if I didn't do some additional service. \n\nRough start but a strong finish, with no attempt to be up-sold for additional work and the extra stuff they did left me with a good feeling. \n\nHere is the link to the $15 coupon. \n\nhttp://www.myjiffy.com/oil_change_coupons.php#"
4,"The sandwiches here are really, really good. Sometimes I find myself in a coffee shop or lunch place that has a  salads/sandwich/soup based menu and find myself trying to figure out why more places don't try to be a little more original in their offerings. Echo Coffee has a couple great cold sandwiches and a couple great hot ones, and their pastries are all good too. Their lattes are smooth and perfect and float down your throat at just the right temperature. These people take coffee seriously and clearly love what they do, and it shows."
4,"The food is delicious, the people and service are great, and Eric is the best. If you haven't been, you're doing yourself a disservice. Love the eel here."
2,"What this place has going for it is the centre-strip location, without Bellagio or Caesars prices. This is why I typically stay here or at Bally's (opposite Caesar's and Bellagio respectively). The great thing about Vegas is that you don't need to stay in the fanciest places to play and eat in them, as long as you're not staying off-strip and hoping you'll be able to get the same experience by getting a bus or cab to the more upscale places.\n\nUnlike those places (and others like Wynn, Venetian etc) I wouldn't choose it as a classy romantic retreat, but as a place to rest your head it's perfectly serviceable.  It's got some old-school vegas tackiness, and affordable rooms, without going too low-end cheap. I went for a Go room (the renovated ones) which had the key ingredients of \n- comfy bed\n- TV in the mirror in the bathroom\n- spacious shower\n- fridge\n\nDespite it being a more expensive room, there were still some falling-apart fittings. Nothing worth moving rooms for, so I didn't waste my time mentioning it. Sad but true.\n\nAs is the trend at cheaper strip casinos these days (particularly the harrah's brand if this trip was representative), there's a heck of a lot of the bullsh1t  6:5 blackjack around, even in shoe-dealt games. Here, there were still tables from $15 and up on a Thanksgiving Friday night which didn't have that small print, but I resent having to scour the table for small print before I sit down. Other otherwise identical tables with the same limits had the small print. Caveat emptor I guess, but that should be at least a star off for their part in ruining a beautiful game."
4,"Let me just say this. As soon as we arrived in Vegas, Cugino's was our first stop before doing anything...3 days later, we had to stop by again before leaving Vegas! Yes, it's that good! And the family here are all awesome people. I'm starting to feel like one of the family members...love this place!!!"
0,"I frequented this location approximately 3-4 times a week for almost five years.  It used to have the best manager and quick service.  The food used to be great and the orders accurate.  Now it is totally in shambles and I had to stop going in because I didn't have the time to wait for their slow, terrible service.  Not to mention the last half dozen times they were out of my flavor coffee.  Will not go to this location ever again, it is in a terrible state."
4,Thank goodness this place opened.  I have had a number of their coffees and they rock.   The best thing about it is the water dish for my dogs.   I love going to the park and then heading over with the dogs for some coffee to see my friends.  Oh and the service is wonderful.   They always ask me how my coffee is.   Its nice.  My new hang out.
0,"Haven't been here in like 3 years because last time I had a bad experience with their customer service. \n\nBut they do have good thai food, so I decided to give them another try last night. \n\nAaaand we found a caterpillar in our curry. Like a decent medium sized fucking caterpillar. \n\nENOUGH SAID."
1,"Coming from a CrossFit box that was one of the first 50 in the country, I was excited to try another one on my work trip that started back when nobody knew what CrossFit was - CrossFit Southwest. Sadly, of all the CrossFit boxes I've dropped in to, CrossFit Southwest offered the biggest disappointment.\n\nThings started off well. I emailed to ask about dropping in and Ken responded quickly welcoming me to come in without a drop-in fee. \n\nThe gym is located in a strip mall. Compared to other CrossFit boxes I've been to, CFSW's set up seemed pretty \""old school\"", or \""dated\"" might be a better term. It's an open space with uneven pieces of matting laid only in the center of the room. The pull-up cage in the center of the room is also quite old and uncoated, so it got slippery quickly. There were no squat racks bolted to the ground, there were maybe 4-5 old mobile racks.\n\nEnough about the equipment because the equipment does not make a gym, and let's face it, you can do a lot of CrossFit without any equipment. I went to the 4pm class and there were about 7 other people there. The workout was ring work as skill and then a metcon of running and pull-ups. Ken lead a semi-warm-up, which sadly for all the ring work involved later had very little shoulder warm-up. There was no progression on the skin-the-cat for those members who couldn't do them or even get upside down on the rings. Coaching for the remainder of class also felt lackluster. Two of the people in class were pretty friendly, but the girl I ended up working with was really unfriendly and didn't even acknowledge me when we were introduced. I'm not saying everyone has to be best friends, but come on, at least show an out-of-towner some hospitality! \n\nI was in Tempe for 3 days and after my first drop-in at CFSW, I was really bummed that I had two more days there to get my CrossFit in. Fortunately after some research that night, I found another box that's about the same distance and ended up going there for my next two workouts in Tempe. Needless to say, I don't think I would recommend CFSW to any of my friends."
2,"Went back to Wicked Spoon last week. I believe it was my 4th or 5th time there. I feel like the quality overall has gone down. The presentation wasn't as immaculately pretty as before and many of the dishes were just okay this time. The atmosphere is still great and service is wonderful but I think if I'm in the mood for a buffet the next time I'm in Vegas, I'll go over to Bacchanal."
0,"What a sad excuse for a chain that touts its football games and specials on Sunday. I walk into this place about 1:30pm on Sunday and the hostess has no idea who is playing or what is TV. The bar has one person and one table filled. Meanwhile, there are football banners and pennants everywhere promoting the NFL, but they apparently don't carry the NFL package because only the nationally televised game was on their five TV's. Even the staff is wearing football jersey's - well there was a reason it was empty right smack in the middle of an NFL Sunday. What a pretender."
2,"I'd been sick for a few days and not up for cooking, so my boyfriend and I went in search of a cheap lunch.  Uncle Sam's, down the block, had been calling our name for weeks.  In need of big-time sustenance to help me fight the germs, I was ready for a meaty sandwich.\n\nInside, there was plenty of seating, and a few TVs showing the Penguins game.  The staff behind the counter was young and enthusiastic, chatting with each other and commenting on the hockey action.  We placed our orders at the far end of the counter - I got the Loaded Italian Sausage sub (comes with flavorful Italian sausage, grilled onions/peppers, and cheese).  I was confused when the girl taking my order asked if I wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Um....no.  That seems totally wrong on an Italian sausage and peppers sandwich.  My boyfriend got a Philly cheesesteak, and despite my badgering, he DID get it with tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo.  His philosophy is pretty much to get every available topping on a sandwich if it will make it more delicious.\n\nWe waited for about 10 minutes while a guy working a big grill surface browned up our meat.  It was fun to watch Taylor's cheesesteak turn from a gorgeous deep red to a delicious steaky brown.  I appreciate that they cook everything to order here, and they don't have piles of cooked meat waiting around to be thawed or microwaved or anything.  Our sandwiches were about $7 each I think, which was reasonable since the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the sandwiches were huge.\n\nWe took them home, and they were still warm when we unwrapped them.  They were both pretty good - I didn't exactly hear angels singing, but the meat was flavorful in each (and both sandwiches were definitely heavy on the meat!)  A regular size person with a normal appetite could easily get two meals out of one big sandwich.  I preferred my Italian sausage to the cheesesteak, since mine had more seasonings, the addition of grilled veggies, and no (totally boring and unnecessary lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  no!)  \n\nI was thinking 3 1/2 stars, trying to determine whether to give them an edge up or down, when my boyfriend told me that the people behind the counter making the sandwiches weren't wearing gloves?  .....blargh.  I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but he assured me that he saw the grill-guy pick up our meat with bare hands and put it on the grill.  To be fair, there were some little pieces of wax paper partially enclosing the meat, but still.  And the girl who wrapped our sandwiches did not have gloves on either, he noticed.  Maybe they work really hard to avoid directly touching the food....but still, I'd say gloves are preferable.\n\nI'm pretty much the opposite of a germophobe, so I don't really care that much, but I think 3 stars is fair for now.  I'm sure we'll be back to try another sandwich, and if it impresses me, I think 4 stars is in their future.  WAAAAAAAY better than a Jimmy John's/Subway type place, no contest there."
3,"Definitely the best coffee shop in the Champaign-Urbana area. The prices are reasonable, the music (at times) is decent, and the baristas for the most part are friendly. On top of this, they have consistent closing hours at midnight. The reason for four stars is that it can occasionally be a hit or miss on the quality of the prepared drink. Also, the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price."
0,"zero stars!\n\nthis is the absolutely worst  business let alone florist! \nthey showed up 15 minutes before the wedding, we got no pictures with our flowers, we had to set the flowers  up ourselves. when i asked where they had been. the guy handed me a box, got back in his van a took off with out saying a word!  i called both the the office and 800 number more then 40 times to get answers w/ not one answer or return of my voicemail. i called up until the minute they showed up. the wedding started late because of the flowers. not to mention the our boutonnieres were wilted\n\n when confronted about thier breech of contract they were rude and threatened to remove my sister (bride) from their property.\n\nso rude so unprofessional the worst business ever.\n\nplease if you are thinkg about a florist, go else where! do not!do not! do not! use this florist!\n\ndont not use this business!"
4,Set up an appointment the day of for ombre/highlights. Felicia did an incredible job and she cut my hair for free :) so pleased with results!!!!! Will be back to see her from now on!
3,"This place is solid for lunch.  Yes, it is a total hole in the wall, but that is part of the charm!  Right? I went with regulars, who ordered for me, so perhaps the menu may be hit or miss.  What I can tell you is that my meal, what ever it was, was great.  It was a noodle/BBQ pork dish.  And the deep fried spring rolls were fantastic.  And guess what was even better?  My whole meal, which was more than I could eat, was $4.50!  I will be back."
4,"One of the best buffet in Las Vegas!\nWide variety of food, anything from seafood, italian, asain, selective meat.  \nMost of the dessert were prefect in my opinion.  \nSo, try it yourself."
0,Rice is always HARD!\nWe've been coming here for 3 years now and was always great until the last 8 months.\nI've tried three different times giving them the benefit of the doubt but the rice has been under cooked all three times.\nSuch a shame as it used to be one of my favorite places to eat. But not worth the money for hard rice....
2,Can get really busy then the service goes to hell! On the plus side the security guard will help you try on wigs.. he's quite adorable.
1,"I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too. \n\nI decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad. \n\nthis is a little bit like OJ's \""i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it\"" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels. \n\nbut no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldn't even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help. \n\nso i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. you're welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me."
1,"Went here with 2 coworkers for lunch on a Friday afternoon, man what a waste of time. I came from California to eat this? Staff were EXTREMELY friendly (almost over the top), but the service was absolutely terrible. We didn't order any of the complicated and long preparation time items and it took nearly 35 minutes to get our food -- and the restaurant was barely 70% full. \n\nI got the baked pesto ziti with chicken. It was all right, nothing to write home about. Would be great for pesto lovers as its drenched in it. The redeeming factor was that the grilled chicken addon gives you A LOT of chicken breast for your 3 bucks. The bread bowl was also a little disconcerting\n\nThey forgot to input my coworkers order (slice of pepperoni pizza) into the computer and it took an extra 10 minutes after the rest of us got our food to prepare that. Seriously? 10 minutes for 1 slice of the most common pizza ever served?! Other coworker got the Big Rig Rigatoni and she said it was pretty good. Definitely looked better than my dish.\n\nOverall this reminded me of the typical American chain-ish restaurant with the HUGE portions. Staff were superfriendly but that doesn't make up for a disorganized kitchen"
3,"I thought this was a solid little hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. In fact, they provided a complimentary birthday card and chocolates for my wife! \n\nThe location is convenient near Downtown and Old Montreal. Walkable to other areas (like Mile End), but you have to enjoy walking for those places. Convenient to the metro if you don't love a 45 minute walk. \n\nRooms are a cozy size, like a typical European hotel. I'd stay again."
3,"The ambiance in this tiny place is so adorable, on that lil patio that is kinda in between what looks like a main dining room and a hookah lounge.  I came to eat with a friend who'd been craving Mediterranean food. I was so shocked that this spot was still open, after 10PM. They have a full bar and a nice lil hookah bar.  The food is bomb and the service comes with a smile.  I can't remember our server's name but he was so nice.  He described how the dishes were prepared and let me know that it was possible to make lil changes if necessary.  Their lentil soup was so good. I think it might have been the best that I have ever had.  This one had what seemed like a cotija cheese on top.  That made it so delish.  I know that lentil soup isn't all that exciting but let me tell you, esp coming from someone who doesn't like lentils all too much, this lentil soup is fab!!! I'd come here just for that and the warm pita!! The schwarma plate is huge. Sorry I'm sure I didn't spell that correctly. Anyways, the portions are large and really could feed 2 people.  The prices are right and they are not shy about refills on drinks and things. Awesome. I can't wait to bring some friends here, when they are in the mood for something other than a buffet or pho on spring mountain. haha. Oh and before I forget to mention, they even have an all you can eat pasta option for about $10. Good deals."
3,Another triple D place. Very unique and pretty good. They let you sample everything before you order. Food is hot and service is quick. Lots of people in line. You need to at least give it a try.
0,"**HOTEL REVIEW**\n\nGot a free room so wanted to check it out. Asked for an upgrade to one of their newer rooms but was denied. I remember during the Yelp Spring Break we had a tour of the suites and it was really nice so I thought maybe the rooms would be similar. The furnitures in the rooms were new and good, but man.. everything else screamed ghetto. The bathrooms were old and the showers felt like I was at a gym. I had to wear sandals while showering because the floors looks disgusting. It is also very noisy and you can hear everything on the street. We heard sirens, cars honking, people yelling. \n\nI will never stay here again, no matter if I have a free room or not.\n\nThe casino and cheap drinks were cool though."
3,"Had a coupon for buying tickets to bite which got us a huge slice of pizza and a beer for 5 bucks. Cant beat that. The pizza was actually really good. The meaty slice had meatballs, italian suasage, bacon and pepperoni. Great food for the price"
1,"Disclaimer: I am not a resident at Paragon. I went in looking for a 1-bedroom apartment. \n\nI am on the hunt for an apartment and I took myself through north scottsdale today, stopping in at paragon on my tour. I would say that just about every apartment sales office that opens on sundays (some don't, granted) opens at 12PM and stays open to 4 or 5PM. I arrived at 12:45 to find out that Paragon doesn't open until 1PM. lame. I toyed with leaving and not seeing the property, but didn't listen to my instincts (mistake #1). I waited it out and came back at about 1:05. \n\nI walk inside and there is no one at reception, well fine, i'll just wait. Someone yells from the back \""Morning!!\"" I don't know if they are talking to me so I say nothing. \""MORNING!!!\"" again. \""oh hi there\"" I reply. \""You are just going to have to wait, I'm setting up still!\"" Huh? Who says that? I wasn't complaining about waiting, and besides that, you don't talk to clients or prospective clients that way. \n\nIris walks out and offers me a cookie as she walks by saying \""you know we don't open until 1PM\"" me: \""It is one, isn't it?\"" her: \""barely.\"" UGH! Why didn't I leave?! Then we are talking and she's getting my info and she asks my price range and then tells me \""oh well you won't find that here.\"" and yet I didn't leave (mistake #56 at this point). So for the first half of the tour and explanation she is a big puffed up elitist telling me how exclusive this is or how fancy and amazing that is.  Amazingly by the second half of the tour she was telling me she could get the price down to my price range (through flagrantly faulty math) and saying she could really picture me here. Yikes, no thanks lady!\n\nA 1-bedroom here runs $990 a month with no utilities included. The apartment and the complex are nice, but I have seen apartments that are equally as nice with the exact same amenities for $250 less per month. And with the offensive attitude of the sales person, I simply cannot imagine what kind of elitist douche-bags actually live here. if you are a normal person living at paragon, god bless you i don't know how you do it."
2,"Honestly, I don't think i would go back again. The food wasn't that great. For a buffet charging more than the Wynn buffet or bellagio, the selection wasn't as great. A lot of little desserts that weren't too good. The Korean short ribs were a good touch, however. We went when the buffet opened and everything was fresh. The crab legs got soggier as the night went on. The location of this buffet was so far inside the hotel that it was almost annoying. It seemed like it was tucked into the back corner of the cosmopolitan. \n\nOne thing was that the server was a little over the top when he was talking and had a little spit control problem and also seemed more preoccupied with his tips than actually serving. \n\nI would give this a 3.5 since the decor was pretty nice."
3,"Have been here twice now and both times it was amazing. It is now going to be a tradition to go back on every trip we make to Vegas. There is always a wait but you can put your name in and they will send you a text when your table is almost ready so that you don't have to just stand in line. The first time I tried the burger the pepper on it and it was HOT I ended up having to pick it off halfway through but the flavor was incredible. The sweet potato fries are a must try, they are served with a dip that really makes the fries better than anyone else's. The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin, they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well. We tried the parmesan fries the second time and they are good also, they come with a garlic dip that is super potent but goes well with the parmesan on top of the fries. As far as service I would have expected something better from a place of Gordon's, that is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars. We had to wait forever for refills and our waitress hardly checked back on us... at least the food didn't have any problems that needed addressing."
3,"I've been to this place many times but I'm finally getting around to write a review. First of all it's in a great location, right on Mill Ave. You go up a flight of stairs and you'll be greeted  and seated usually fairly quickly. If it's not too hot or too cold you might want to try the outdoor patio. The view is nice and it's a bit quieter than the inside. As far as the food goes, it's not 5 star gourmet fair but they make an excellent burger and the garlic fries are out of this world. The beer selection is quite good and the service was prompt and cheerful. I've never had a bad meal or bad service here. Give it a try for yourself and see what you think."
1,"It's very unfortunate that I have to give this place 2 stars. They say first impressions are the most important. Well, my first impression of Le Chalet wasn't a very good one. We had reservations at 8 on valentines day. We weren't seated until 8:30 which I understand because people especially want to enjoy dinner tonight but the hostess didn't know anything. If we didn't say anything, we would've been waiting longer. \n\nThey had a special performance for Valentines day which we opted to see for an additional fee per person. It was a nice show but service seemed to be halted due to it. 80% of the people there already had their meals. It took us 2 hours to have an appetizer (the crepe with scallops), cheese fondue which had an unbelievable amount of butter in and a dessert crepe which was delicious. We originally ordered the \""La Potence\"" but since it took over 45 minutes, we cancelled it. Turns out it was the right choice since the kitchen didn't even prepare it yet. \n\nCan't say I'd ever come back by choice as it seems they need practice for serving a full restaurant. Turns out my scallops weren't prepared properly as I suffered from food poisoning later in the evening. Quite an impression that will last for some time."
2,"There used to be a tiny little fast food Vietnamese joint on 6th Street and Mill that banged out pho for cheap, cheap, cheap that I used to frequent all the time. Unfortunately the ingredients reflected the price, they never so much as purchased a sign, and it ended up going out of business in less than a year. \n\nI can only cross my fingers and hope that the same doesn't go for Dragonfly Vietnamese Kitchen. The original is wicked fantastic and located in Mesa that has been around for a couple years and consistently produces some great pho (tripe and tendon anyone?), papaya salad and noodle dishes I have ever had. And at this new location they've created a sleek, urban eatery that fits right in with the rest of the locations on Mill Avenue, but manages to trump them in every respect. (Price, service, ambiance, and of course, the FOOD.)\n\nDragonfly just opened a week ago and has a large banner instead of a sign advertising their presence, but judging by the lunch time crowd, word of mouth has really worked for this place. Their lunch time specials are impressive, with offerings of papaya salad, spring bowls, rice plates, several types of pho and Vietnamese sandwiches with soup or ginger vinaigrette dressed greens as a side for a humble...wait for it...$7.50. I'm still baffled at how they can offer such plentiful, healthy, delicious food at such a reasonable price.\n\nThe soup of the day was Dungeness crab and asparagus soup, and there was no way I was passing up crab soup for a measly salad. It was such a good decision to go with double soup (pho and soup du jour) because it was peppered broth with HUGE chunks of real crab, asparagus, mushrooms and baby corn that was out of this world! We ordered the spring rolls as well, which were also HUGE with poached pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers wrapped in rice paper and served with some of the best spicy peanut sauce I have ever had. The soup and spring rolls would have made a perfectly adequate lunch, but once the pho arrived, I dropped everything for this brothy delight.\n\nIt was served in a HUGE (picking up on the trend here?) square bowl with thin slivered beef, vermicelli, and scallions and garnished with bean sprouts, lime wedges, fresh mint, jalapenos, sriracha chili sauce, hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Any combination of these additional ingredients will result in a savory concoction that can help you nurse a cold or open your sinuses, all while warming you to the core. It's fresh, healthy, light and scrumptious! I can see myself eating her very, very often in the future, and straying from my usual order of pho to branch out and try other things on their menu, all of which are still reasonably priced for a Mill Avenue joint (FUCKING SUCK IT BOA!) at 8 to 12 bucks an entree. I would also highly recommend the fresh squeezed limeade, made with sparkling seltzer water instead of still, which was a refreshing spritz of flavor. They also have a full bar, a must for Mill Avenue joint.\n\nThe outdoor patio is surrounded by a pretty twisted wrought iron canopy exit at the front of the store and will offer a lovely dining experience since the weather has started to cool down. Inside the restaurant, the color scheme (green, white, plum and black) and ambiance create a fresh, vibrant, urban feel with large bamboo fixtures nested in beds of smooth black rocks. After talking to our server we were also informed that they hope to have a mellow live musical act in the middle of the restaurant in the near future for diners to enjoy. \n\nThe service was also AMAZING! Prompt, friendly, easy on the eyes, and attentive. The food was ready lightening fast (almost too quickly considering our first courses, but I can see how the speed is great for getting people on a lunch break in and out) and the waiter was charming, making sure we got everything we could possibly need at lightening speed. \n\nI really, really, REALLY hope this place does well because I want to become a regular here. So go check it out and support a local business rather than a shitty chain on Mill Avenue. I can only hope more of these gems continue to pepper this ever increasing stretch of vapid consumerism, so I don't end up feeling like a corporate whore after my meal. Don't want to taint a dining experience this good with whoredom.\n\n*****UPDATE*****\nThey have happy hour specials now from 3pm to 7pm! Half price appetizers: Tamarind chicken wings, lettuce wraps, crispy shrimp wontons, hoisin glazed spare ribs, and Vietnamese salt 'n pepper calamari! Domestic bottles 2 bucks, Imports for only a buck more, top shelf well drinks for 5 bucks, and house wine for 3 bucks.\n\nThursday through Saturday they have live jazz on the patio from 7pm to 10pm. Best thing of all? They extend their happy hour appetizer and drink specials to their customers during this time. So you could eat and drink cheaply anytime between 3pm and 10pm Thursday and Friday! AWESOME!"
1,"KFC's service sucks? Slow? Not new to me.\n\nEating at this kind of place and wondering why this place is still in business. Food was okay, they serve great wings with a cheap price. Won't probably be coming back anytime soon because of the bad things this place has."
4,definitely one of my favorite pizza spots ever! and it tastes even better when you are drunk borderline blacked out-- the line may be intimidating... but trust me it's worth it!
0,Horrible service. Driver was rude. Excuse for non delivery was intercom not working. I have tested the intercom myself which worked for me. USPS had no problem last week using the intercom. UPS had no problems. On the 3rd attempt I waited for the driver outside to accept delivery.  Will not use Amazon anymore as long as ONTRAC is their delivery service.
0,"So here I am. I really should've read the reviews on yelp before I purchased my groupon from this place. \nAnyway, I bought a groupon offer for xray,exam&regular cleaning combo for this dentistry. Reason? For my regular half an year check up & cleaning. Plus I don't have insurance so that's the only reason this time I went for a groupon. Ok let's start the story. I went there this morning, waited 25 mins then had a x-Ray taken by a young girl, then a doctor came and told me I had some kinda gum disease and 5 cavities. I was very shocked cuz I do go to my dentist every half a year. And actually a little over 7 months ago I even got my regular teeth cleaning & whitening done. My dentist told me Last time all l need to do is do a lily take more flossing, other than that my teeth were looking good! Half a year later, my teeth really got some kind of serious problem and gum diseases? Ok.. Another 30 mins later this young girl finally came back with an estimate for $1724 for my \""deep cleaning\"" for next two visits. And also a credit plan. I remember when I had my gum bleeding a few years ago I had to get a deep cleaning and it was less than $600 at a dentistry in Chandler. So I told her it's ok I'll just do my regular cleaning. Ok put back in the waiting area again. 15 mins later, told me I'm free to go. Really? I asked what about my cleaning? I paid the offer on groupon. She said they can't do a regular cleaning for me because I need a deep cleaning. I have the estimate and it's optional. I repeated one more time that I paid the offer and it does include the regular cleaning. Ok now she says \"" you have to talk to groupon then, we don't promise to clean your teeth when your teeth need something more. I have other patients and I don't have time..\"" \nWow of course I walked away, being very angry. Paid the money for cleaning and got nothing except all this BS. And wasted over 2 hours of just sitting there. How would you feel?\nThis is absolutely CRAZY! And I would just say DO NOT GO THERE!"
3,"Another nice hidden foodie joint if you are ever in the area! Located just North off the Valle Verde Dr exit from the 215 freeway in Henderson, look for the Kohl's department store because its in the same complex.\n\nInside you will find nice tables and chairs with all sorts of East Coast themed sports memorabilia and paraphernalia. Well except for the San Francisco 49er #6 jersey of Mike Cofer, who was a kicker. Huh? I asked the cashier and he said that dude is a good friend of the owner. He also lives in town. I dont get it but and the same time dont really care because I am a Seahawk fan. Yup. The 2014 Super Bowl Champs. Nuff said.\n\nAnyways, to the food. I decided to get the Yelp 10 for 7 dollar deal. With that I got the Steak Bomb ($8.99). I also added fries and a drink for 3 dollars more which seems like a good deal. If I didnt get the Yelp deal, I probably would have done the check in deal which was a free upgrade of fries and a drink to your order. I think the total would of been the same which came out to 11 and some change.\n\nThe Steak Bomb is I would say about an 8 inch kaiser roll that has good sirloin meat, accompanied by grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and topped off with provolone cheese. After the the first bite I can actually taste some kind of basil or rosemary seasoning which gave it bit of a flavor boost. Imo, it was pretty good but for some reason I think it could use some kind of sauce. The fries were ok.\n\nThe people that were at the next table ordered the Lobster Roll and Clam Chowder. From the looks of it, it looked very enticing not to mention the smell. I think next time I will get the Clam Chowder for I havnt had good chowder since my days up in Seattle when I would frequent Ivar's.\n\nService was outstanding. The same guy that took my order at the counter was also the same guy that brought my food out and asked me several times if everything was ok. Not only did we have a conversation about the 49er jersey on the wall, I come to find out that he is a Raider fan. Ouch. Good luck with that bro. Gotta give him props for sticking to his team like a true fan should.\n\nSo bookmark this place and check it out if you were going to Kohl's for some shopping because shopping makes one hungry. Also they have gluten free pizza for you folks that are allergic.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #126 \""How you like dem apples?\"""
1,"Way too pricey!!! Not at all LA style pastramis... Probably will be our first and last. Waiting forever right now for our food, it's a Sunday no one else in sight and still we wait."
0,"I purchased a card that gave me 5 difference services, and to say the least - its been very disappointing.  I've had an express Pedi - which was lack-luster. Firstly, if you are going to be the person doing the pedicure, you should dress appropriately for the job. The nail tech was wearing a low cut, short dress, that she had to drape a towel between her legs to cover the 'view'. There was nothing that could be done for the top - but surely if you are going have customers looking down at you, you'd wear something that didn't fall forward. \n\nShe also spent a good 10 minutes of the 30 minute Pedi looking for the bits and pieces she needed to do the pedicure. As I had made an appointment a week before, you'd expect they'd be ready for you. The leg massage lasted all of 2 minutes on one leg and 1 minute on the other. Luckily I'd taken my own polish as their selection was very limited. I think they had around 15 colors.\n\nThe girl doing my Pedi couldn't find the toe separators, so instead she used paper towel from the dispenser on the wall. The chairs are very uncomfortable and quite high - which was a problem when she left to let my toes dry and didn't come back. After 10 minutes I climbed out of the chair, then had to get back to floor level in order to remove the paper towel myself self and get my flip flops on.  When I got to the front desk, she was texting on her phone and talking to the other employees at the desk and looked like she had clearly forgotten about me. It was a bad first impression and experience. \n\nI thought I'd give them another try and use the hair cut option on my voucher. I called and made an appointment, and much to my dismay, when I arrived I got the same girl - my bad, I should have asked who the stylist was. But in my defense she never introduced herself the first time, so I wouldn't have known it was the same person.\n\nMy hair cut was worse than the Pedicure. First off - 1 1/2 to 2 inch trim, did not mean cut 5 inches off my hair!!  While my hair needed 5 inches cut off, it was not what I had asked for.  Second - I have long hair (very long) and after she'd finished the cut (which wasn't cut in sections, she cut all of it in one go) she didn't bother to check that both side were the same length.  I had to do that at home and trim it myself.  Third - after she put the styling product in my hair, she wiped her hands (to clean them) all over her clothes. I sat there wondering how many other people she had styled today and what germs and bacteria would now be transferred to my hair!  The blow dry was just as bad as the rest of the hair cut. She didn't take the time to clip up any of my hair, out of the way, but just brush it over the top of my head. This then tangled my hair and she used the same round  style brush to then try to get the tangles out which just pulled and broke my hair. This was while she held the still running hairdryer under her arm.\n\nThe entire experience was very unprofessional and I really have to wonderful if she was fully qualified as a stylist. Her actions clearly indicated she had very little training or experience or if she did, she was just plain lazy.\n\nWhile the voucher seemed like a great offer as an introduction to their services, it hasn't enticed me to continue using them. If anything, it has ensured I won't return and suggest other steer clear of them too.  Very, VERY disappointing."
4,"This place was amazing! If I could give it more stars I would! My best friend took me here for my birthday last night and it was my first time going. I've heard great things about this place so I was excited to come here! Well it completely surpassed any and all expectations! The food was AMAZING! The shrimp was so good! I almost asked for more! The meat kabobs were so tender! I usually don't like meat because sometimes their too chewy, but it just melted in your mouth! I had never tried couscous and I must say I'm glad that my first time trying it was here because it was sooooo fluffy and the chicken literally fell off the bone! AND THE DESSERT! OMG!! probably the best thing I've ever tasted! At this point I was stuffed beyond belief but when the dessert came out I could not help myself! It's a Nutella/chocolate banana filled filo dough pastry baked and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon along with a hot tea! Perfect way to end a delicious meal! I cannot wait to go back!"
2,"We live close to the mall and this is one of our regular spots. We have been so many times that I guess the \""interesting\"" decor is not really noticed anymore. There is everything from Hollywood props of dinosaur busts on the walls....like I said \""interesting\"". But it is the food and service that brings us back. We have a picky eater and their Mac and cheese is his fav. My wife and I usually get a sandwich of some sort, there are lots and lots to choose from. You can also build your own sandwich if you desire. Bottom line......great family place inside Concord Mills mall."
0,"Worst shit I've ever eaten, couldn't even finish then threw up.  AVOID AT ALL COST"
0,"My father and I did the prime rib special.  The prime rib was alright, the ends of the meet were not cooked correctly, also my dad ordered his Medium, it came to us very well.  The baked potatoes we were supposed to receive were cold, so we sent them back and it took them until we were done with our meal to bring back 2 more cold ones.  Both times, they were so cold that you could not barely cut them.  So when my dad asked to talk to the manager.. since it was time to pay the bill or hopefully get part taken off.  The manager, gave us a measly $3 off which was wrong, considering we did not eat half of our meals.   \n\nI was very disappointed in my meal, management, preparations.  \n\nI must say though, our poor waiter was good.  I give him credit for trying."
0,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I saw my watch under my seat and needed to grab it. I was occupied with something else. I ended up forgetting to grab it. At the end of  my car wash I then went to look for it. Management showed me the sign that said they were not responsible and told me to file a report (send to corporate who were not even at the scene). The manager (Jose) said he \""asked\"" everyone about it when I physically saw him only ask two people. This is a terrible establishment and they have now lost a customer for life for their lack of honesty. DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE WITH YOUR BELONGINGS!!"
0,"Unfortunately this place has horrible customer service. They messed up my order and refused to make it right. Their food is just like their customer service - horrible. See for yourself, why don't you :)"
3,Went here for lunch and boy was I surprised. The food was delicious!  The Lemon Chicken and rice soup was fantastic! Their Pitta Gyro sandwich with the greek salad - outstanding.  I love their menu and the multitude of items you can get and just pick at with a table full of friends.  Its a little small inside but they also have an outdoor patio. They have a wine bar which I'm sure would be nice for dinner time - or lunch if your a lover of wine.  We will totally be back here for dinner some night soon!
2,"Every time I came to Vegas I wanted to try this place but it was always over booked, so this time I did it in advance and was kind of exited. Honestly this place is way overrated and I think mainly because of it's view to the show. If you take away this experience then you end up with overpriced steak house. Food is is not bad but not superb ether. If you are staying at Wynn I'd suggest trying Bortallota restaurant, it's more expensive but food is amazing!"
2,"They make a yummy  chilled chai latte!!!\nAZ summer heat can be bad.......they have a nice patio area with misters & sun shades or if outside is to hot, their inside is nice to.\nThe bathroom was gross, so I would avoid using it if you can.\n\nGood service. If you are using a card to pay, must spend $3.99 or more to use it. They have free wi-fi."
3,"I mainly went to see this show because Yelp! had 50%off prices, so for the $40 or so, how could I lose?  I was seated against the stage, which got a lil \""dicey\""...what with 125# athletes, YoYo's and 20' hoola-hoops whipping around.  I admire the stamina, strength and willingness of the performers to put on a great show, despite a couple boo-boo's.  The main issue are the cultural differences with the audience.  During the performance the performers begin sort of a chant-cadence with clapping hands...Now, I'm not Steve Martin in \""The Jerk\""...I can get my groov on...but they would keep changing it up and then frown at the audience for screwing up.  Very entertaining albeit a lil juvenile production...but fun!"
0,"Not a fan of this place at all. Horrible tasting beef and pork. Every time I have ate at this place I have gotten sick. No going back for me.  I know there are a ton of peeps on here that love it, but I guess its all just a matter of preference.  I have not been happy and am not a fan at all!  I have given them many opportunities too."
2,"apas style with East meets... South? Chinese-Mexican fusion. Had the grapefruit vanilla Margarita which was light and refreshing for the warm weather. The chips and salsa are not that great. The chips are fresh though, and the salsa has a smokey flavor to it. \n\nI ordered the Silencio, the taco with duck tongue with lychee. It was a little on the salty side, but the flavors complimented each other. Definitely spicy!\n\nOrdered When Pigs Fly, which was your basic bao (steamed pork bun). Nothing special really. Linda small to what I am personally used to back home.\n\nThe Dan Dan Moan noodle was noodles in a self-mix sauce noodle dish. It was alright. The sauce was kinda plain, noodles more doughy than expected. Not bad, worth a try.\n\nOrdered the Ocean's Nest. Okay, it was Hong Kong style pan fried chow mein, with lobster. Still not impressed and definitely not worth $46.\n\nThe Empanada de Pollo con Mole Poblano was really good. The mole was complex, savory, rich, and authentic tasting. The outside was crispy, and the meaty filling was cooked just right.\n\nFor dessert, the Mango Sticky Rice was hyped up by our server. She described it as \""light and refreshing,\"" which it totally was. The rice was actually toasted rice krispies sprinkled on too of a coconut creme whipped topping. The mango underneath was so sweet and delectable, very nice finish to the meal. \n\nOverall, it was a great place to try. I personally like the Asian food back home. The Mexican food had a near modern twist, and the drinks were great and surprisingly strong. I give it 3 stars for food and price, it was expensive for what you get, but great service! Very attentive, sociable, and polite."
4,"A friend of mine turned me on to this place several years ago and I aint stopped going yet!! Best burgers, best hotdogs,best bbq, best fries best everything!!!! Cold beer, dos equis!! Phil Hinson is a good friend to me and my family, and we think the world of him and his family!! Phil and Leslie are the two chefs behind the bar and they always go above and beyond. We recently moved to atlanta and miss them alot.Wish Phil would open a Hinsons in atlanta so we could enjoy our hangout place here. Alas atlanta couldnt handle the truth!! Whenever we come back home this is the first place we go! Great prices, great food,great friends!! What else could you ask for. MIss all our friends but we'll see you soon!!!!    HEY, EVERYONE GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GET DOWN TO HINSONS!!!!!!"
1,"Hate to be the guy who does this but here goes... Great service. Everyone working there was really nice and was going out of their way to take care of us. I got the brisket and sausage sandwich and really enjoyed it. Nice soft brisket, flavorful. Crunchy casing on the sausage. Tried my friends' spicy macaroni and cheese and really liked it. Another friend got the Salmon and gave the thumbs up.\n  Here's where the two stars come in. The bar has dirty taps. My friend sent his bud back after tasting it (we all tried it) and noting it had the telltale dirty dishwater flavor and flatness of dirty taps. I drank 2 shiner bocks and ordered a PBR then had to send that back for the same reason. After trading that back in for another Shiner I started getting the telltale headache and realized the darker and slightly less carbonated character of the Shiner had been masking the dirty tap taste. Next day we were all feeling like ass. Except for the guy who drank Guinness in a can of course. For a chain, the BBQ is good. Service great. If you plan on having a beer, get it in a bottle."
2,"We had big plans for the day - hiking in the Scottsdale's McDowell Sonoran Preserve.  Unfortunately, we didn't wake up as early as we thought we would.  And, of course, I prefer to eat, rather than hike.  So because it was late in the morning, we decided to try The Breakfast Joynt.  It was difficult to find, but after being told it was next door to Gold's Gym, I managed to track it down.  \n\nThe inside is nice, but the d\u00e9cor is rather Spartan.  We were told to sit wherever we liked, so we took a seat.  The waitress immediately spotted us, and brought water, and asked if we wanted coffee.  She then brought a large coffee pitcher, which she left at the table.  And real cream.  We decided on the basic breakfast, which consists of two eggs, two pancakes, choice of meat, and  hash browns.  I opted for the bacon (4 slices) and my better half ordered the sausage.  \n\nThe meal was better than average.  The eggs were cooked well, and the bacon was perfect.  My wife enjoyed the sausage.  I, of course ate everything (including about 90% of the syrup), but my wife was only able to finish about one half of her meal.  There were lots of pluses that I liked.  The coffee was left at the table; the syrup was in a small pitcher; the waitress was very good;  the bacon was cooked perfectly; and the service was fast and efficient.\n\nThe only things I did not like was (1)  the hash browns were very average, and (2) the coffee cups were small and felt like plastic.  I always feel that a breakfast place should have a variety of potatoes - home made hash browns, potatoes O'briens, etc,   and you should have a heavy mug for coffee - especially if it's in the morning and you need something to hang on to.\n\nI will certainly return - but I am still looking for the perfect breakfast place in Scottsdale."
4,Great soup and pad Thai and beautiful decor.  So glad we tried this this place and can't wait to come back.
3,"I am glad I didn't read reviews on yelp (I hear the bump up and down restaurants depending on ads).\n\nI have to say that the restaurant in fact is expensive, but nothing completely ridiculous as my husband and I have eaten in restaurants in Santa Barbara with less food and less taste.\n\nI am a pescetarian, so I ordered the sweet and sour fish, the fish filet with black been sauce and the white egg and shrimp fried rice, tea, and white rice (about $90)... needles to say, it was very good, and the fish was very fresh. So, my mom and I came back a second time for lunch.\n\nMy mom had the soup, same white eggs and shrimp fried rice and I had the Thai style noodle sea food (which is suppose to be just seafood and curry sauce)... when they brought the noodle it had pork! But they were nice to give us a plate without pork... it took a while, so we ended up taking it to go.\n\nI am sure you can find great Chinese food for less with equal amount of taste, but it was convenient for us as we were staying at Caesar's Palace."
4,"Really into this kind of thing, so after discussing the results of some intuitive/psychic sessions and my past-life regressions, a friend enthusiastically referred me to Josefa. Although I had heard of akashic records prior to my reading, I didn't fully understand what they were and/or why they mattered. Regardless, I decided to give it a shot and reached out to Josefa, who immediately let me know how to get started.\n\nWhen we got on phone, Josefa quickly put me at-ease by not only explaining what the akashic records are and what they can tell us, but also by outlining how the session would be structured. My reading was unbelievably accurate and insightful. Josefa confirmed several recurring themes in my current lifetime and past lifetimes, as well as my life's purpose.\n\nI loved that the reading was interactive. Josefa regularly checked in to see whether or not the information she accessed was resonating with me and encouraged me to interrupt her and ask questions as they came up. If you're even the least bit curious, I highly, highly, highly recommend you book a session with Josefa."
4,"I was so excited to hear that PJ opened next to my work!  I love how trendy the decor is and the food is even better!  I could eat that grilled chicken and hummus everyday if I could!  Last time I tried the Grilled Veggie salad, it was a large portion and delish!"
2,"Check in on labor day weekend for breakfast. Never a fan of a tourist spot restaurants but its always cool to try new things. Couldn't decide and my phone shut off from partying so hard to tell what to get aha. Had the steak and eggs and it was okay, coulda been better, 4oz steak was flat and small. Friends had seared tuna sandwich - it was huge but a lil too salty and old. And the special steak - which was really good. We were also in the middle room so it got a lil chilly from the wind blowing out. Definetly would like to try againn"
4,I had to add a review after reading that Portillo's uses frozen crinkle french fries.  Jimmys uses a whole potato and slices it right in front of you - nothing frozen.  Jimmys is great.
0,"I went to hillend at the request of a friend to give her some advice on how to ski, having grown up in Switzerland and done teaching there for a few seasons I was happy to oblige.\n\nWe had a couple hours of fun, the slopes are good and night skiing is really special.\n\nHowever just as we were about to leave an older instructor skied over and proceeded to tell me off. I actually apologised as I didn't know it is not allowed to give your friends advice but then it got personal and he told me that my friend was sliding all over the place, an offence apparently on a ski slope, and it was my fault for doing a bad job of it, he skied off before I could respond. \n\nI think that was uncalled for and that this particular member of staff was quite rude. The reason I was teaching my friend in the first place is because the two hour group lesson she paid for had over 15 pupils and the instructor couldn't even to begin to teach them as he had his hands full with one struggling student. Waist of money and time as all she got taught was to put her skies on.\n\nAll in all, customer experience muddied by this rude member of staff and a confirmation that the beginner group classes are not worth the money, go private or go somewhere else."
4,Steffan was extremely helpful in answering all my questions and even providing ideas etc. thanks!
4,"Absolutely awesome! I've been here a few times for lunch and they have delivered the goods each and every time. I tried the pad-thai the first time and haven't swayed away from it (and probably never will - like, ever). A few friends in the lunch party had different dishes, one was a vegetarian the other ordered a chicken based dish and everyone walked away from the table barely able to breath and honorary members of the \""clean plate club.\"" \n\nThey have great lunch specials and offer generous sized portions. The flavors and textures of the foods are outstanding. I absolutely recommend this place to any Thai food fanatics. \n\nOne quick, funny story is that we went there on December 30th for lunch. We were advised that the lunch specials were not available because of \""the holiday.\"" I asked which holiday and the server told us New Years. Guess it was a day early. Didn't matter, we were grubbing out regardless."
1,"A very interesting boutique hotel. I've seen pictures on Hotels tonight and was very intrigued by them and wanted to go by and visit the hotel lobby on my next Vegas visit. Was not intending to stay there, but stayed 1 night because of the good deal on Hotels tonight. Did not know anything about the after-hours club, or the noise level. If I did I would have not chosen to stay here, as the music was overwhelming coming up thru the floors of the 4 story hotel.\nUpon check in the valet asked if we stayed here before or knew about the hotel. When we said no, he told us about the club going to 8am. Apparently the only nights they do not have the after-hours club is on Monday and Tuesday, so ask for a room that is not over the club. \nWe are not club people, so getting back into the hotel at night was like going thru security at the airport lol, had to speak to 2 different people to get into the lobby to get to the elevator to get to the room. \n\nThe noise level was loud, but it was because the walls were thin and we could hear the dog in the room next door yelp and bark, the traffic outside because of the thin glass window, and the people above us sounded like they were going to come thru the floor into our room when they walked since the squeaking was so bad.\nAlso the hallways are loud since the floor is tiled and not carpeted. Since this hotel is an old Travelodge, so are the rooms and I took that into consideration with the thin walls and floors. Unfortuantly our A/C didn't cool the room even tho is was on the coolest setting at 60 degrees, it only cooled the room down to about 75. \n\nLoved the chic goth style of the hotel, but it's better for more of a drink and not to stay unless maybe you're going to the after-hours party.\nThe check in gentleman was nice and helpful, but I thought the $150 \""deposit\"" for 1 night was a little steep."
2,"This place is way overpriced. $3+ for a slice is ridiculous. Filling up the cups all the way with ice and then adding the soda? Cheap. Pies left out the whole day and reheated slices for 90 seconds? Not fresh.\n\nBUT! The location is super convenient and there isn't really a competitive alternative close by. Just around the corner from Brickyard so great for Engineering students to grab a slice. Awesome selection of pies.\n\nIf you do go here, be very specific about what you want. \""No ice\"" or \""Very little ice\"" if you're getting a drink, \""Make it crispy\"" if you want a crispy slice or \""Don't overdo it\"" if you don't. The employees are really nice, but if you're picky about pizza (and price!) you might not enjoy this place that much. You're really paying for convenience over quality IMHO."
2,"Service and ambience was very good and extremely accommodating. Table side Caesar Salad was unexcitingly boring. Dressing was weak and when side order of Anchovy was requested, none was to be found, which was surprising considering this was supposed to be an upscale restaurant. Sea bass entree was disappointingly small and thin, only about 4-5 ounces. New York strip steak was over seasoned but cooked perfect rare. Prime rib 12 ounce cut was very good and over sized. Side of mushroom Risotto was cooked nicely to an al dente bite but they used a false chicken stock made from chicken bullion instead of house made stock. The msg really tasted through. \nThe best dish of the night was dessert. Bananas Foster, made table side correctly with no shortcuts like the Caesar Salad. The Foster was excellent.  \nWould I return?  Yes. But be extremely selective on the menu."
2,"I don't have much to say because I really just popped in here from the casino floor for a glass of wine...which cost $13. Ugh. If you want the swank atmosphere, I suppose it's ok, but if you want cheaper drinks you can find them elsewhere."
2,"So I haven't yelped in a while and in the last year have been living in Montreal-\n\nHaving said that I don't know if I'm a food snob or just spoiled by all the great food in LA or if my taste bud are just trained to like certain foods... \n\nOn to the review- saw this place featured on a show called: \""You Got to Eat Here\"" and well no you don't have too.\n\nI have been here twice and both time the experience is average. It's NOT a steak house - it's kind of like a dark Canter's - the smoked meat (like a mix between corn beef and pastrami) was very tender, moist, and melt in your mouth yummy. We also shared the smoke meat poutine was huge with plenty of smoked meat it's really a meal all by itself. \n\n  The service was friendly we had both time gone at off hours 4pm and 8:30pm \n\nIt food was good but not great and it's a bit dark and dingy - like a dive bar I guess a dive deli\n\nWould I go back? yes. Do I crave their food? Not really."
1,Have stayed here many times before with no problems.I just erased a long complaint. Basically the beds are horrible and the remodeling is funny too put it lightly.Wanted too leave after the first night but couldn't.We got sent by flamingo too an outside booking agency when booking the room so it was a hassle to leave.Thanks flamingo for ruining our much needed vegas trip.
0,"Nasty!! I've never had worse food in my entire life. I took a few bites and that's it. I ordered two meals , one for my son and he took a bite and said disgusting. I ordered a coke and they gave me something else that looked like coke but clearly didn't taste like it.dont go there."
2,"It was late afternoon, and we were hungry, so we decided to eat at BLT since it was in the hotel we were staying at (Mirage).\n\nMaybe because of the time of day we went, but it wasn't busy at all, so our party of four people got seated right away.\n\nThe menu is just the right size, with enough options to keep it interesting, yet not an overwhelming amount to have to study and narrow down to just one choice.\n\nBurgers, sandwiches, apps, sides, shakes, floats, beers, etc.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of Hoegaarden, which came out to about a beer and a half for the four of us. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress' beer pouring. She began pouring the first glass with one hand. Everyone knows you need BOTH hands to pour beer - you need to tilt the glass and pour it on the side so that the head isn't ridiculously large. She didn't do that, so while she was moving on to pour the second glass, the first one began overflowing and got everywhere. She laughed, apologized lightly, and wiped it up. My friend jokingly said that we should get a free beer for that, but either she didn't hear or didn't care to respond. Either way, beer was wasted and we didn't get compensated for her mistake.\n\nAnyway, moving on to the food...\n\nI decided to get the ahi tuna spring roll but they were out of that (another disappointment), so I ordered the California Chicken on wheat instead of a sesame seed bun. The food came quickly and looked appetizing. The portions are reasonably large, but they should be for the amount you're paying. The California Chicken tasted alright.. a little too heavy on the avocado."
4,"I have eaten here a number of times and love that it's not a pick-up joint atmosphere like the other restaurants at Piedmont Town Center have become. The service is always impeccable, but not too 'hovering.' The food is always outstanding. I've taken my sister & hubby here several times and as picky San Fran residents, they always rave. Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and presentation of the food and their wine selections are fabulous. I always enjoy my time here and feel leaving the money spent was well worth it."
3,"Great stadium, weak fan backing like every other losing team, but good food/beverage options and every seat has a good view."
4,"Food, bar, service and experience were all outstanding.  We are going back again tonight as there were so many things on the menu that looked amazing\n\nCame back again with my girlfriend and it is as good as ever.  We each had lobster salads to start, then had amazing entrees.   The best part was Chef Kline came out to greet us.   As usual, outstanding!"
1,"My friends were in town and they wanted something to eat so I decided to pick this place because I haven't tried it yet.\n\nWe ordered family style for the 6 of is except 1 of my girlfriends is a vegetarian so she ordered her own veggie dumplings.\n\nThe lady brought out the food and she was confused about what she brought out. She told us one of the plates were a vegetarian dumpling plate so my friend tried it only to spit it out because there was meat!! How rude! How do you not know what you're bringing out!\n\nWe then proceeded to tell her that they both had meat in it and she was like 'Ohhhh okay.' We were all a bit frustrated because we wanted to wait so we can all eat together.. By the time here came out, our food became cold.\n\nThe juicy pork dumplings were not the business and the rest were meh. I've had better at small hole in the wall places in vegas.\n\nI only enjoyed the chicken wings and the fried dumplings, that's something to enjoy!\n\nI'm giving 2 stars because the lady that was making the dumplings actually came out to apologize when our own waitress didn't."
4,"We ordered the lobster, a seafood soup, Chinese vegetables and a fried fish with tofu. All was great. Portions are generous. The service was prompt and nice most of the servers speak little English but not a biggie."
1,"Ghetto!\n\nMajority of the karaokes are pretty okay with updating the latest songs. This place is a little odd. They have a couple new songs and the rest are pretty old. All the \""good\"" songs you expect to sing at a karaoke are not found here. The microphones are all dented and busted up so the quality of your voice doesn't even sound like you. The table was really sticky probably from the people before us spilling soju all over the place. I like the fact that they use a projector as the main screen but didn't like the fact that it was all the way in the corner of the room rather than in the center and had wires hanging down from the ceiling. Literally! I honestly would have rather went to a karaoke where you sing in front of hundreds of people and embarrass myself than to go here and not have a good time at all. We left within the first hour. Only thing that was good was they have buy one get one free alcohol deals."
3,"This store was my dream when I moved to Madison two and a half years ago.  I could pick up fabu curries for lunch and YumYum cookies for dessert.  They always had a cold diet coke, as well as that red pepper garlic sauce that is so addictive.  Also, cat food if I was really in a bind--and apples and bananas.  The owners knew me when I walked it which is just what I needed after moving here from a small town.\nWhen the Corner Store changed owners, I was heartened that the previous owners and the new owners were longtime family friends and had owned a restaurant together in the past.  Surely nothing would change--and very little did.  Same face recognition, quite a few more Asian ingredients(almost worth the price of admission in and of themselves) , still cold diet cokes, and cat food.  But then they quit using jasmine rice with the curries.  The owner said it was just a glitch, but it kept happening.  Maybe it's changed now as I have moved and not been there in a few months.  If not having jasmine rice with your curries doesn't bother you, then this hidden gem may just be your place."
1,Sports Page used to be a fun spot & I've been going for nearly 10 years. I just recently moved to the area but used to travel to Charlotte to meet with friends & we would always meet there. The last 3 times I've went is was drastically worse. The bartender ignored us (each time)...It seemed like a bar where only locals are welcome. The food has gone downhill as well. I couldn't even finish the nachos...mostly because I had no drink to wash it down. They still have potential but I doubt I'll be returning.
4,I LOVE tryst!! It is my favorite restaurant- I have been going there the past year now.  They have lots of gluten free options(I am gluten intolerant). The quality of the food is really good. It never leaves you feeling sick to your stomach. I have a very sensitive stomach and I am happy to say I have NEVER had a bad experience at Tryst! They have lots of organic food so if you're into eating clean and healthy I'd strongly recommend Tryst cafe!!
4,"This is one of my favorite places in the city.  1/2 price bottle of wine from 3 pm to close, great bar drinks (pricey yes) and simple but good food.  Piano player is unbelievable!   Has a feeling that just maybe and I mean maybe - Phoenix has a little bit of culture.  I have continued to go to My Florist Cafe for over 6 years and being from Seattle where culture will jump out and grab you My Florist always delivers a little \""Seattle\"" - thank you and keep it up guys!"
0,"Horrible service, horrible management., food mediocre...and watch out for their site specific rule of only 3 alcoholic beverages.  This is the only Texas Roadhouse with this rule...doesn't matter the size or strength of the drink..you only get three so drink slowly! Won't be back..."
3,"An outdoor mall that has automobile traffic cruising through the mall that's fully equipped with shops, movie theater, restaurants/bars for the big kids, a park for the little kids, and even leashed aminals are allowed to roam around with their parents. It's the newest mall, outside of a casino, in Las Vegas so of course you expect it to be pretty and she sure is! It's got greenery, water and personality. \n\nLet's start with the obvious, the shopping. So you've got your Apple Store, kinda expensive shops, i.e. Banana Republic, and you've also got your reasonably prices shops, i.e. H&M, both of which I do like but they're usually not in the same mall, at least, not out here! Even if you don't make any purchases, it's a real nice place to take a walk in, yes we do it, so what? And they have a Borders that you can visit, if you're sick of walking but don't want to go home, you can grab a drink, a magazine and have a seat. \n\nRave Motion Pictures (their movie theater). All their theaters are, as claimed by their website, 100% Digital Projection, meaning, \""Oh wow, that's a nice picture!\"". Lots of leg room, so if you're like me, small ass bladder, when you're walking through the aisle to use the potty, you don't run the risk of passing by those people that refuse to fricking move their legs when they know that you're trying to get through. \n\nDone shopping and that sound that you thought was your puppy growling is actually your stomach? There are plenty of places to eat that you're able to choose from. Most of them have outdoor seating so it's nice to be out there when the weather is a notch above spectacular. If it's more of a late night thing, they have restaurant/bars that you can choose from too, yard House, Cadillac Ranch (mechanical bull available), etc. Nice places to hang out for you night owls. \n\nRight in the heart of the mall is an area for families. There's a reasonable size playground, (fake) grass area, small bridge w/ water that flows underneath it and small stands for refreshments if you feel that you need a cool down. In the grass area, they sometimes show free movies, have lives bands, etc. \n\nPet lovers, this is such a pet-friendly mall! Some (yea, not that many) restaurants have water bowls in front of their shops, relief areas provided with those wonderful black plastic bags, and I think that you can eat with your pet in the outside seating areas at some of the restaurants, at least, I saw several restaurants that allowed it? My lil Min-Pin loves going here and so do we :)\n\nI knocked off a star just because, c'mon, it's Vegas, another outdoor mall??? Yea, it's so fun walking around the mall in 102 degree weather! If they can make this an indoor mall, I'd give 100 stars :D"
1,"I love stores like this especially that they always seem to be mailing me coupons for 20% or the $3.50  off purchase,  but geez.  The testers are always used up ,missing or completely violated. Customer service doesn't seem to be a priority either.  It's 8:35pm  ( I realize they close soon ) but I'm standing in line and there's four cashiers all gossiping about whatever and one lone guy cashier trying to cover the line. The only one in the store that seems to be always on top of his game is the security guard that's always friendly and helpful!"
1,"Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.  \n\nThis K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't decide then if visiting K-Mart is frugal or frivolous, but who doesn't need another cheap belt?"
0,Staying at this hotel made my stay in Vegas absolutely miserable. I never had thought that it would be so unpleasant.  It always smelled like smoke when I was walking down the hallway to my room. The floors were very dirty. The elevators were rusty and  every time I used to take it I was praying to god that it wouldn't snap off. It is at the end of the strip so all the main attractions are missed and it takes a long time by taxi or walking to get to the good spots in Vegas.
4,"After a hard week of studying, my friend and I decided to try this place out and treat ourselves to some relaxation.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the associates there. There was no wait and everyone there was so friendly. We both got a pedicure and gel manicure and when we were done, we were very satisfied with their work. The associates were very attentive to even the slightest detail. Not only can I get my mani/pedi there, but I can also get an eyebrow wax and haircut while I'm there! Overall, I had an amazing experience. It was a good price with excellent quality. Ever since the first time I came here, I've been telling all my friends to come here instead. I absolutely love this place :)"
0,"Worst Dairy Queen ever. Slow service at the drive thru, cold greasy fries, crystallized ice chips in ice cream, watered down gravy, and even the chocolate was thin and tasteless. I have lived all over the US and eaten Dairy Queen many times. This is by far the worst of the worst! Even the toast in my chicken strip basket had no butter and was dry. I have tried on 3 separate trips to get decent food at this location, but it is apparent that isn't going to happen."
3,"While on vacay my husband and I used our Groupon here for the bistro brunch. The menu was fixed, I had the house yogurt with granola and berries and the quiche du jour. I really enjoyed both items, very tasty and I ate every bite. \n\nThe 4 stars is for the somewhat lack of service (our waitress disappeared for quite a while) and the fly in my hubby's beer yuck :-/\n\nI still will come back next time we're in Vegas."
4,So many choices of mimosas to choose from! Passion fruit and strawberry was yummy! Tuna crepe was delicious. Service was excellent.
4,"We love this place! It's near our house and has great, fresh sushi! Many roll options and even has a non-sushi menu.  It's family owned and operated, which I always like to support.  The owner/sushi chef is very friendly!  It is small, however, so I'd suggest a reservation if you have a big party, but with 2 we can usually find a seat at the bar."
0,"Slow, not clean or organized, and my brat wasn't good. Good fries though.  Underwhelmed. Very poor options in the Phoenix airport."
4,"With all the new competition up and down the strip, I am amazed at how much fun I always have at Pure Nightclub. Yeah, it's not visually great compared to XS, Marquee, Surrender and all those other hip and trendy nightclubs but it seems to me that nowadays people have forgotten the simplicity of having a good time at a nightclub. Having music geared to all crowds and providing a venue for people to come together, drink and dance = a good time. But I guess that's why people go to Vegas right?? Haha\n\nFor me, I've become quite annoyed with the whole outdoor pool nightclub scene that has become so popular nowadays. Half of the time I'm struggling to find a place to sit, stand and dance without worrying whether I'll slip over into the pool. I appreciate that Pure gives you the option of a full-on dance floor on their main floor with a few VIP areas surrounding and above the dance floor. At other venues I'm stuck between squeezing in to the dance floor or toppling over into someone's VIP. I really enjoy the old school tunes and Top40/hip hop in here.\n\nI also appreciate the outdoor rooftop level, although it can get crowded, it gives you a very nice view of the strip, some fresh air and some good EDM. \n\nYes, the crowd is definitely older and not that appealing for the 20 something yr olds but I find that Pure provides a really nice atmosphere to party with your friends. I've never waited more than 15mins to get in nor have the girls AND GUYS paid cover. They've had free drink specials for the ladies until 12AM as well. Pure is obviously trying to keep up with all the competition but who's complaining here?\n\nWould definitely come back."
0,"We had to book a room here at midnight after having some altercations with our original hotel plans.. It was dirt cheap but obviously you get what you pay for...the room made you feel depressed and dirty. However, the customer service at the front desk was great. They were very friendly and helped us out with whatever we needed. But honestly I would never ever stay here again."
2,"Went here when I was 39 weeks pregnant for a lunch date. I have been obsessed with all food Mexican for the past several months and am all about good Tex-Mex.  atmosphere was good, lunch crowd was busy but not overwhelming. Our server went over the specials and I decided on two tacos.  One was shredded pork and the other was chicken and they were both very good.  Nothing outstanding..... I would be open to trying a margarita there and another more authentic dish."
0,"My husband and I are really chill and laid back folks. We are not extremely picky and need the glitz and glam. They had a great deal for only $42 per night for the weekend. I knew I was taking a chance when I booked this place through travelocity. We have stayed at plenty of places off the strip and all around that area. I figured this would be the same. Boy was I wrong!! \n\nThe front desk staff was very nice and provided great service. The lobby looked nice, but you can tell by looking around the property, it was going to be iffy. They are in the process of remodeling the rooms. Our room (monarch suite) was roomy and at a quick glance looked nice. Parts of the bathroom was just old, worn, and dirty. The shower head was way too low! I'm 5'5\"" and it was just above my head. My poor husband is 6'1\"" and he had a tough time showering. \n\nThe housekeeper crew came around every day and did a fantastic job. Overall, we will not stay here again, because the place is just dingy. I can't complain too much because we paid $42/night for the weekend."
0,"I had to take a couple of weeks to write this review since negative reviews aren't my thing and felt that a cooling off period was necessary.   We were guests of the Golden Nugget July 21st-23rd and we do choose to stay here frequently and enjoy all it has to offer.  After checking in on Monday afternoon, we noticed that Cadillac has a happy hour and figured that would be a great way to start our visit this time.  Jaycee and Norma Jean were at the bar and took care of us as we enjoyed some cocktails and an awesome quesadilla on the HH menu.  We decided to to return on Wednesday (23rd) night for another good experience.  This time no seats were available at the bar so we sat within earshot of the bar.  We ordered a beer and a Margarita and asked specifically for the Margarita to be hand shaken (as it has been since the cocktails conception), I am a stickler to this and most bars accomodate without incident.  The drink was delivered to the table and obviously was not shaken and had that poor layered appearance and taste.  We asked our server to please have her re shake the cocktail, simple enough right?  Mind you, we are within earshot of the service bar and we can hear the bartender complain about us and how she shakes all her drinks.  One, my many years of experience of working behind the bar I can taste the difference.  Two, shaking a cocktail makes a very distinct sound, which was heard for the first time when remaking my cocktail.  As she was belittling us, her guests, the server was trying to warn her that my wife was standing right next to her.  This didn't seem to concern her at all, She just scoffed at my wife and turned her back to her.  We could of let it go at this point and enjoyed our evening, however, the bartender had another agenda.  She proceeded to tell the guests at the bar that  my wife was clueless and had no idea what she was taliking about.  She didn't change the drink at all and now we like it.  This couldn't be further from the truth,  the drink was physically different, frothy and such, and we didn't enjoy it or the sticky glass with salt all washed down the side.  Obviously at this point we have had enough of her verbal abuse, paid our bill, after declining a freebie from the chef (manager of duty) since we asked for a manager from the server and she responded they were busy right now, hmm.  We asked the bartenders name, and to my surprise no one knew it, convenient?  One of the servers pulled me aside and said her name was Nicole, no idea if that is correct or not, doesn't matter at this point since I will never return to this place."
0,"This will tell it all... As we are walking out a waiter returns sushi to the sushi chef because he made it with avocado and it was suppose to be made without. The chef was visibly annoyed so the waiter said \""don't make a new one just scrape off the avocado\"" SO HE DID! I went right up to the manager and alerted him because what if the person eating it was allergic or something! He pretty much just stared at me and said nothing while I was telling him then finished by saying \""oh that's not good I'll take care of it.\"" We slowly walked out to see what he would do and he did NOTHING!\n\nThe creamed spinach was extremely salty, our sushi order was made wrong the first time, when it came back correct we didn't eat it because the crab tasted so fishy like it had been out too long without proper storage-it had to be spoiled and I'm just praying I don't get sick!! \n\nThere was one server for 10 tables!!! It was a two hour process just to have salad and sushi!\n\nAWFUL EXPERIENCE AND SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICES!!"
3,"This review is solely for their happy hour. Buy one get one free!! You get either the yard long margaritas or the 24 ounce palm tree margaritas and it's buy one get one free- all  night! I also wanted a jalapeno margarita, which they didn't have on the menu, and the bar tender went ahead and made it anyways and included it in the happy hour prices. Very nice of her. \nThis place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY past 7 PM. But what place in Vegas is? The staff was drunk and the manager was a little creepy... the bouncer was telling me that the managers buy free shots for the girls that come in. Once again, not a surprise in Vegas. \nGood view! You can sit outside by the water and pirate ships. \nOverall, for the price, why not??"
2,"We just got home from taking my husband for a late Father's Day lunch at Humble Pie.   It's located in the same building as the unsuccessful \""Living Room\""  which has an awesome interior.   The joint was hoppin' but they managed to squeeze our family of three into a spot.  The service was great and we were in luck because the specials and happy hour prices were in place.    We decided to go for \""pie\"" and each of us ordered a pizza all were quite good and our favorite was the Meatball Pie.  We would like to go back to try out something other than \""pie\"" -- which I think I prefer Cibos instead.  This is definitely a family-friendly establishment that doesn't frown upon small well-behaved kids, but it still has the nice cool downtown vibe."
3,"You can't go wrong with a refreshing Jamba on a hot AZ day! Like others said, it's always better to come when you have a bogo coupon but every so often it's worth going without a coupon! I always add the boosters to it. The wheat grass is not worth trying.."
3,"Clean! Clean! Clean! \n\nI didn't have any expectation of our stay here but I was very impressed. \n\nAnd to think that it was only $59.00/night! I can't complain. My friend did the reservation months before. \n\nOur room had a good view and super clean, dust-free flawless! I can tell if I suffered from allergic reaction."
3,I have had a good experience at this location. The manager is very attentive and quick to solve any issues that arise.
1,"I went to the Cathouse before heading to LAX and must I say that this place falls insubstantial compared to the night clubs I've been to in Kansas! The theme was sultry and sexy with waitresses decked in fancy lingerie, the hallways were filled with antique portraits which gave off a Halloween-ish ambience. The best part of this place was getting in with no cover charge, I don't know if it was because we got in with a group of us girls or because it was after midnight. The music was okay, nothing I could really groove to. I had a vodka pineapple the cup size you get for free coffee at the doctor's office for $10. I was wondering why they'd charge so much but I remember the bartender using Absolut vodka in my drink...without my request. I wasn't sure if their automatic use of premium liquour was a Vegas thing, or a more exclusive thing...however, I paid $10 for a drink that didn't give me a buzz, so I wasn't very pleased, although pricing in that range is expected in Vegas! The setting was awkward, there was really no escape from creeps, which there were a few of! When I walk into a club, I usually like to scope the place out by walking around...it was hard to do with chairs and tables crowding an already small dancefloor area. All in all, the place is worth checking out for FREE..I wouldn't pay whatever their cover is to get in. Good thing, because I didn't stay for more than 20 minutes."
2,"Ambience- \nPros- Modern, clean, \nCons- dark and tables too close to each other\nService-\nPros- Attentive, polite, concern \nCons- Food came out a bit too slowly, (maybe because of ARW)\nFood\nPros- flavorful, food presented in simple yet appealing style\nCons- nothing really stood out\n\nFirst course-\n1) meatballs with polenta - meatballs were moist and polenta had good flavoring and consistency\n2) prawns with beans- prawns good grill flavor, seasoned well, beans were also creamy and well cooked\n3) cheese artisinal board- good quality cheese with some fruit compote\n\nSecond Course\n1) cioppino- good seafod flavor, seafood- clams, prawns, and octopus were fresh and the tomato broth well seasoned ( I add lime and chilli powder to give it a kick)\n2) Wagu brisket- well cooked and seasoned, favorite is the grilled cauliflower (according to hubby)\n\nThird course (dessert)\n1) ricotta fritters- dry and boring after 1st bite, average tasting, \n2) chocolate flan- nice presentation inside little jam jar. flavor- more of a pot de creme and had more complex flavor with the salted caramel topping\n\nWe drove far (Northeast Mesa) to come to NOCA.

0,"Took a guest to Abuelo's for dinner. I was very embarrassed. First off, the atmosphere was nice. Very unique! Our service was great but there was not a lot of people there. The chips were good but the salsa tasted like they squirted Macayo's taco sauce into a bowl and called it fresh!( My guest came up with this comparison!)  \n\nMy guest had a steak fajita chimi plate that came with rice and beans. The presentation was gorgeous! The cheese sauce on top tasted like the canned Nacho cheese sauce you might get at a state fair. In fact...my guest said that was all he could taste! The refried beans were very bland. No lard for sure! The rice resembled a Chinese fried rice which was just weird!  He hated it so much that he didn't eat much. \n\nI had the steak Fajita's which were supposed to be marinated.(NOT)! It was over cooked(some spots were even burnt and crunchy) fatty cheap steak. My guess, Flank or Skirt steak! The veggies under it were not Mexican! They consisted of broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, a few peppers and a lot of onions. It was served with a bowl of pinto beans. They were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke! I didn't eat much of my dinner either! \n\nI have traveled many places and dined in many exquisite establishments. This in no way resembled Mexican or Spanish cuisine in any way.  Just gross and VERY over priced!\n\nhttp://spoonfulpersuasion.blogspot.com/"
0,Worse food and service I've ever experienced. Extremely rude people work here!\nThey were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her. She removed the drinks then was a complete bitch! I suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay!
0,"This place has slipped significantly in the past 6 months.  No meat in the rolled tacos, smaller and smaller burritos, same or higher prices.  I would like to direct anyone close by to Armando's on 48th St and Thomas.  Cheaper, better tasting and larger portions.  This Filiberto's has become run-of-the-mill and cheap.  Other good reasons to stay away:  adjacent to a bus stop and a telemarketing joint.  Enough said."
3,"I finally went, yay!\n\nI have to admit, I've been dragging my feet on trying this place. I have two reasons for the delay. First, I haven't really gotten into the food truck craze. I can't help it, I really like sit down restaurants. I enjoy making dining an event. Although I do love me some Fuku. Second, I have heard a lot about the social aspect of the Slider Truck and that made me shy away as well. I may be weird, but I like a little anonymity with my meal. I don't really want to play around or be \""on,\"" so to speak.\n\nI felt I had procrastinated enough, so after much hemming and hawing, I made my way out on a very rainy evening and I couldn't be happier that I did. There was no line and we were only one of two groups of customers here at the time. We ordered and we did have a nice little chit chat with the guys and luckily, I had a really nice experience.\n\nMe and my guy tried just about every slider they have, minus the caprese, since I hadn't heard too many good things about it. We also got an order of the sweet potato fries and the Mystery Slider, which happened to be turkey pastrami, which I wasn't really a fan of. The Captain's Order and the Yaya were my favorites. I also really liked the porky. Yum. The sweet potato fries were exactly how I like them, more on the sweet than savory side with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. Some honey drizzled on top of that would make it an even bigger hit with me. \n\nI'll definitely be back."
4,"Last week was my first time in Vegas so I looked to yelp to kind of scope out the scene so I knew which parties to go to and which to try and avoid. My friend saw DJ Lema was spinning at Tao Beach Club so she bought us tickets. When we looked on yelp the day of the flight we read a lot of bad reviews on this place.... so here is mine:\n\n       I absolutely loved it. It is small but you can pay $200 ($50 each  for 4 friends which is unheard of in Vegas) to get a bed. That $200 can be used for drinks and food - so youre set. EVERYONE is so nice. Waitresses are not stuck up, and are extremely helpful.\n       There is a mood director - amazing! Gets the crowd dancing, clapping, jumping, etc. \n       The Venetian, itself, was just a beautiful hotel and casino, so the walk to Tao Beach Club was awesome. It is big, we did get lost lol. There are 3 pools I believe - Tao Beach Club is all the way in the back."
0,"This place is anything from new york!\nCardboard pizza, sauce out of a can, the crust tastes like cardboard, you take a bite and it comes right off the pizza!! And for what they charge!! Its a joke!! I have had bettter frozen pizza!!"
3,"I had one one the best old fashions I've had in a while. Street tacos were fantastic, great presentation as well. Service was good, cool atmosphere to relax and have a good drink with some good food. Would definitely recommend it, and would definitely go back again."
1,"Unlike what the yelp category states, this is a Sikh temple, not a Hindu temple. \n\nThe place is hard to find, as it sits on a residential corner with a lot of shrubbery in front and a rather short nishan sahib (orange flag indicating it is a house of Sikh worship). Good luck finding parking in their tiny lot, you will most likely have to park on the adjacent street and walk back to the temple. There is a space in the fence you can walk through so you don't have to go all the way back to Russel and enter that way. There are double doors on one side of the building, but don't try to enter that way; the actual entry is on the south side past the kitchen. \n\nThis is an old house that was converted into the open community rooms you'll find today. Be forewarned that there is no air conditioner and little shade outside of the building. Make sure you stay hydrated before visiting! Service starts around 12:30, although a lot of people come earlier for snacks beforehand. \n\nAlways make sure that you take off your shoes at the back entry, where they have a huge shoe rack, and cover your head before entering. There are separated men and women's restrooms through a door on the left just after entering. The entry room serves as a tiny langar hall, although they have a couple folded tables set out under a makeshift porch. There is a cute little altar inside the main room. After services are over, people turn the main room into a temporary langar hall and serve food to the seated. I don't know how appropriate the method is, but the place is tiny, so I guess they do with what they have."
2,"I ordered a lemonade it was sour to say the least, the server said it was fresh but I have my doubts. My wife ordered a Moscow mule, it was devoid of ginger beer and as she put it the worst she has ever had. They don't offer bread or a veggie plate with your meal, odd to say the least. The atmosphere is a saving grace. The food was good and bad. For my entree I ordered the watermelon salad (I had bariatric surgery) the salad was small but more than enough for me not enough for the average person. My salad was very good, but the piece of burnt toast (chibata) they served with it wasn't edible, literally. My wife ordered the wild boar and papadelles it was a large portion and very good. I thought it was as 8 of 10 my wife thought less of it since the sausage was on the overly spicey side. The service was fine. Ahhhh the price, TO HIGH. This is not Biltmore, it's not Scottsdale, for what you get the price really is way to high. I don't mind spending a pretty penny for dinner, but here the price is way to high."
4,"One time I was in Vegas with some friends and we had one of our dinners in this restaurant. There were 4 of us. The ladies who I was dining with are all extraneous about their figure, but they wanted still to enjoy a wonderful meal. First my best friend ordered her food and she wanted her meal to be cooked without oil. I was thinking, ok here we go, some complicated orders... The other two ladies told the server that they would order one filet and wanted to split it, and one wanted hers cooked medium and the other wanted hers medium well, and also cooked without oil. By this time I was hanging my head in shame and became nervous that the server would protest in some way. He said, \""that's the best idea I've ever heard, excellent choice.\"" He made us, especially the ladies, feel like they were on top of the world, and that we smelled like a bouquet of roses. \n\nI returned a year or 2 later, but to the restaurant upstairs. After the server took my order, all of the sudden, by the way I was feeling, I recognised the sensation. Again, I was at the top of the world, I was the best customer ever, and I smelled like roses. Impeccable, outstanding service from both Paris Hotel restaurants."
4,"Went there after purchasing a Groupon deal. Ordered the lamb burger and seasoned fries. Get to pick your own choice of cheese,toppings and condiments. The lamb burger was huge and very very delicious\n I had them make it well done and it was perfectly done....very juicy and tasty. The fries was very tasty too along with the spicy ketchup. The food was so much that I couldn't finish it and had to doggy bag it. Can't wait to go back and eat there again."
2,"I have to agree with Molly T's review of this event.  Like many people, I purchased a Groupon for a VIP pass and was happily anticipating a classier event.  This show was a loud, \""in-your-face\"" type of atmosphere, with many folks electing to imbibe (heavily) with their dessert samples.  The live music was too loud for the ballroom, in my opinion, and detracted from the overall atmosphere that the event organizers promoted (again, IMO).  \n\nOn the bright side, the chocolate and pastry samples I tasted were all fantastic.  Fresh, beautiful, and indulgent.  I got to speak with a chocolate maker in detail about the whys and hows of artisan chocolate.  That was the highlight of the night for me.  In fact, I wished that there were more opportunities to do that (a lower decibel level in the ballroom would also have helped....).  Cake pops, mousses, mini cupcakes, gourmet chocolates, mini tarts....I was stuffed at the end of my (short) visit.\n\nWas I glad I went?  Somewhat.  It was good to learn more firsthand about one of my favourite foods (chocolate!).  Would I come again?  No.  The whole experience was a bit too \""mosh pit\"" for me.  However, I got to taste delicious desserts, so all was not a loss.  :)"
3,"I've been here a few times since moving to Pittsburgh last fall. Totally a dive bar and I love how unpretentious it is.\n\nThe first time I had gone we were greeted by the bartender/owner? but then were apologized to for not having any pierogis. I guess they had ran out during a happy hour. Waitress came by and before she took our order said BBT was sorry that they no longer had pierogis but made some other recs. We were bummed about the pierogis but each ordered the kielbasa sandwich. And man o man the kielbasa arrived (though it took a while) and wow it was fantastic. Little crispy on the outside and some good flavor with the sauerkraut and mustard. On our way out, the bartender/owner again apologized for not having pierogis though told us to come back and I sure made a note to. You definitely feel at home being in place like BBT.\n\nI came back a second and third time to bring some out of towners and BBT did not disappoint again though this time they did not run out of pierogis. Red plate special along with some beer. I haven't had any thing but polish food at BBT though do not plan on deviating from it. The nights they have bands play are fun too."
3,"I went back to Orange & Brew twice in the last week and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, they now carry Angry Orchard cider on tap ($4.25/pint) which was great- still not much variety but I'll take it. The second day they had a special for cheap glasses of house wine which were generous portions! The waiter we had both days was very attentive to us as well as other customers around us. I can't speak to the food, but a friend ordered a meal and was promptly served and she seemed satisfied. There were a bunch of people around watching games on tv so it wasn't as awkwardly empty as the last time we were there but it really is a weird space to begin with. They seem to be listening to some of the feedback people have been giving them."
4,"Genna's is the ultimate happy hour spot, especially during the summer. We have a group of friends who meet here on a regular basis for \""HH.\"" Get here early to grab a seat outside, and enjoy the people-watching and good weather. Oh, and the free munchies..."
1,I have been eating here since the late 90's when I was in college. I watched them grow from one small room to two. I was so excited to try their new location. I came in after work alone on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I was excited to see the great beer selection. I ordered a vanilla porter. It was quite tasty. It took awhile to put a food order in but the food came out pretty fast. I had the orange chicken and a teriyaki egg roll. Both where very good. My beer was gone by this point and I was never offered water. I sat and sat and sat and sat with zero service. My bartender a female with sunglasses on her head ignored me and the only other guy sitting on the one side of the bar. A bartender asked him eventually what he wanted but\nDidnt acknowledge me. Finally the female bartender asked if I wanted another beer I said no just a to go container and my tab. I am seriously disappointed. So my one piece of advice is call in a to go and pick it up yourself. Don't waster your time with the terrible customer service!!  Ug. Terrible!!
4,"My husband and I had been trying to work out together for years but could not find a gym where we both felt comfortable.  I found out about the Crossfit community through a friend and was told it was for both men and women.  We did the free class and knew it was exactly what we needed.  We joined in Sept 2012 and have been going consistently ever since!  It is a great stress relief, we have met some wonderful people, we look forward to our training, Brendan & staff are very knowledgeable about proper technique and are very helpful and motivating!  We are on our way to our fitness goals and have a new found strength we did not think possible!  Make a commitment to yourself to give it a try.  You will not regret the investment in your health!  I highly recommend!"
0,Barely average food and lots of barely average food...which you won't finish because it is barely average not because there's so much.  Very disappointed in both the food and the rude staff. Not worth going out of your way.
2,"I was attending a business workshop today and decided to stop in here for lunch.  Pros: The servers were great.  They offered a different variety of vegetable options.  However, the meat selections were limited.  I was also looking for some desserts which is common in most places like this; unfortunately, there were any."
3,"The experience was great, first time doing this style of eating. The only parts about it that were ok is how fast you received each meat. And the finale of it all. I wish there was more to desert but im a sweets girl. The meats were delicious, especially the steaks. Oh my they were amazing. Even the grilled pineapple was delicious. They have a serve yourself sides. The chicken salad was really good, so was the salads. Although being the first time id probably save the room for the table side meat. Overall the service was great, the owner lady was really sweet and very kind. They explained everything well, id definitely recommend this to anyone. What an experience for our one year wedding anniversary. Thank you."
3,The first CVS I've been to in YEARS where an employee walked up and offered to help me find something.
4,"Like many before, my fiancee and I have had a lot of anxiety when it comes to choosing a place to leave our dogs while we go have human fun.  Arriving from Los Angeles, we took a flyer on Just Like Home based on the stellar Yelp reviews and were not disappointed one bit.  \n\nWe got to take advantage of the Yelp coupon and ended up paying a fantastic rate for our Welsh Corgi and Corgi-Beagle to stay and have a canine vacation.  While we initially thought that the whole webcam thing was voyeuristic and overkill, we found ourselves checking our phones and seeing how they were doing.  Seeing that they were always being supervised and running around having a good time made us feel happy and at ease during our stay in Las Vegas.  \n\nThere are no problems bringing your own food / items, although we found that their home environment for the dogs (couches, futons, etc.) was more than enough for them to be comfy for a couple nights.  The separation of small / larger dogs was also great to hear.    \n\nI recommend Just Like Home whole-heartedly as a great location to leave your dogs if you're vacationing in Las Vegas.  When we were ready to go home, our dogs looked happy and tired--and that's all we wanted from a dog boarding service!"
3,"We booked a room about 2 months in advance so there was no resort fee for us when we stayed August 1st.\n\nWe LOVE our stay. It is not luxurious but we were satisfied at the price ($65 on weekend using NSAD discount). It didn't have fridge as I had hoped but if that keeps price low, not having extra amenity in the room, then I'm all for it.\n\nI subtracted one star for one reason-- people allowed to smoke in the pool. I was surprise by this and hated it. I understand smokers have their freedom to inhale cancerous narcotins but non-smokers are entitled to enjoy the pool with the incovenience of second-hand smoke. Suggestion: Smokers have their own separate room to affect only their own lungs, not others."
3,"The Satay Bros are serving up some of the best south-east Asian fare here in Montreal, one of the few things I missed once I left the Pacific Rim. Their stall is in the busy Atwater market during the warm seasons and line-ups are generally long.\n\nI ordered a couple of pork satays, their grilled pork sandwich and the gado-gado salad.\n\nFirst, their satays were grilled to perfection. Very juicy and as requested, extra spicy. Homemade peanut sauce was a nice touch. The pork sandwich was good, but far to small to justify the $6.95 I paid for it. The gado-gado salad was awesome to cool yourself on a hot, humid summer day."
1,"What's the deal? This Pizza is only ok...Angelos is better, but I still haven't found a favorite spot. Spak skimps on toppings, I like the divey decor and the workers I only wish the Pizza were as compelling."
0,"First off we are locals and take friends and family to the high roller every time someone is in town and want to try something new and different so this was our fifth time there.my.friend who came from NY bought happy hour tickets for all of us (10) but not for my girlfriend who is 6 months pregnant so she bought her own regular local pass (no alcohol included) Nad when we got to the pods this \""guy\"" wanted to send her on a.diferent pod because she had a regular pass and not a all you can drink pass (cuz she us pregannat) so this idiot says or you all can ride with her on the regular pod......for the same (all you can drink price) or I'll just charge her (the pregnant lady) extra so she can ride with you all in the same pod......\nWe paid the extra and had a great time there.....but his freaking attitude makes us all (vegas industry people) look like a - holes. ....\nWe are not coming back ......thanks"
1,"We wanted to go as a group for happy hour, due to the phenomenal reviews on yelp.  We showed up with 6 people, walked in and were all shocked.  This place is super small.  Tiny, in fact.   In total I would be surprised if it sat more than 20 people.  \n\nAdditionally, due to the small size of the place, it was incredibly loud.  Needless to say, we couldn't stay to experience the food and drinks, because there was just no room for us.  \n\nThis would be a place to go at an odd hour, by yourself or with one other person max.  It's much too small for groups, and parking is confusing and/or unavailable for more than one car."
0,"This has to be one of the worst burger joints in all of Las Vegas. I invited my friend for lunch, and to take in some of the NCAA March madness at The Venetian. I asked him to meet me at B & B Burger at an outside table so we could watch the games. When ordering our food, I asked the waiter what the best side item was too have with our burgers. Granted they were all $7 or $9 for fries, onion rings, warm potato salads, etc. \n\nHe recommended the onion rings with our selected burgers (the standard for me which was$9 and the Morning After which was $15 for my friend). Our waiter was happy to recommend the onion rings so we went with his suggestion. \n\nWhile we waited for our food, we requested water 3 times. We got our meal, but still did not get our water or napkin setup. I tried one of the onion rings and then another while trying to track our waiter down for what would be expected, napkins, silverware and a glass of water, on our table already. I turned to my friend and asked him if he tried the onion rings because they were decent. He said yes, and I asked him how many he had. He told me one. Low and behold, there were only 2 left in the basket! So that would make a total of  5 onion rings (see above on how much we paid for the \""basket\""of onion rings). \n\nWe asked our waiter, since he \""highly\"" recommended the onion rings, if this was some sort of kitchen error. His reply was no - it wasn't a mistake, it only comes with 5 onion rings. We were disgusted. I felt like pouring the water we didn't yet have over his head...which might have spilled onto our dried out burgers to make them moist. Overall, poor service, very poor waiter recommendation, and below average food for the price - 2 burgers and 5 onion rings $35 not including the tip. Lucky I don't know the other B's name in B & B Burger, but for Pete's sake Mario Batali, why don't you just brand a line of toilet plungers than throw your name on restaurants you have no interest in or where you control the quality. Too bad, I was hoping to find that elusive burger in Vegas.\n\nps. I don't condone spilling any type of liquid on service folk, mostly in fear of behind the kitchen door retaliation. Although, the service was below average, we still maintained the 18% tip decorum."
4,Absolutely love their brisket sandwich!\nNothing compares to this sandwich. But I wish they were open until later for those late night cravings!
2,"I still haven't fully decided where my heart lies with Chipotle. \n\nHalf of the time when I come here, I get great food! The other half of the time, it sucks. I usually get weird pieces of chicken in my salads, or burritos (depending on my order). Once it almost even made me consider reinstating my vegetarianism. \nHonestly, though, the last few times I have been here they have done an exceptional job. I will have to update later."
3,"Food always arrives fast, tables are clean. The only complaint and this may sound silly, but their napkins are so light that when you pick up the food tray and walk to your table, the napkins start flying all over the place. This has happened to me every time."
4,"This company was HIGHLY recommended by a CONCERT PIANIST friend in Las Vegas. She said to call them and ask for Joe. We needed to move a piano from Las Vegas to Santa Clarita. I was searching for movers, but only found companies that went from Los Angeles to Los Angeles. Then I got this recommendation. I called and spoke with Joe. He explained what he has to do to move a piano (remove legs, pad the piano, shrink wrap the piano, etc.). He spent quite a bit of time with me on the phone, answering questions with thoughtful responses. He gave me a price over the phone based on several very detailed questions about the type and size of piano, where it was coming from and where it was going (steps, etc.). I was not present when he packed up the piano the night before delivery, but I was told it was VERY obvious he knew what he was doing. He delivered the piano the next morning (couldn't have had much sleep!) arriving bright, cheerful, and ready to work. I couldn't agree more. It WAS very obvious he knew what he was doing. The piano was well wrapped and padded. It was delivered in excellent condition. He set it up and didn't leave until we told him we were satisfied."
4,"My husband and I dined here for lunch on a recent trip to Vegas and we were very impressed! We just sat in the bar area, but the ambience seemed very nice, the decor was eye catching, and the service was excellent. We both ordered the bento box lunch, my husband got his with the sushi and I ordered the miso cod with mine. My husband was extremely jealous of the AWESOME miso cod that I was able to devour! I order miso cod quite often when it's on a menu, and this is one of the best I've ever had. It was a good sized serving, especially considering all of the other items in the bento lunch, all for only $18! I found it to be a great deal for what it was. We were already inebriated from the gigantic drinks at Fat Tuesday, so we didn't get to sample the libations at Social House, but we WILL be back next time we're in town!"
4,"I would recommend this company to any of my friends or family. Bruce Lombardi from Ace Relocation Services was the gentleman who sold us our move with Atlas Van Lines.  I had quotes from 3 different relocation services and I chose to go with you because of Bruce. Bruce did an excellent job in thoroughly conveying the integrity of his company and painted a complete picture of how our move would work.  When you take the extra time to make people feel comfortable and understand why their possessions are going to be safe with your company, that's where you win customer's business over the competitors.  Bruce always got back to me the same day when I had to leave messages and he was willing to help in any way he was able. When we needed more boxes, Bruce actually took the time to pick up boxes in his own vehicle and deliver them out to our house in Chandler, AZ personally, TWICE.  More over, Dwight (The Truck Driver) was a reliable pleasure to deal with and the packers were helpful and respectful. Dwight picked up our things on a Thursday in AZ and delivered to our new house in Houston, TX on the following Monday (always on time).  All in all I would have to say everyone did a great job. Thank you for making this part of our move pain free.  \n\nD N"
1,"Food was ok, service terrible. Sunday lunchtime and they had many workers running around, but not very attentive to my party of 5. \n\nLike I said, food was ok but certainly not worth what we paid for it. Was like sitting in a barn, and they played alternative rock videos, one would think a pseudo western place would at least play pseudo western music, too."
1,"I came here for lunch as I heard it's a great place to grab a quick bite.  The place was crowded but lucky they had a table for me very quickly. I ordered two items on the menu which were the famous intestine food and the Chinese meat ball.  The Intestine soup came quickly.  The meatball I guess was just taking awhile. So, I sat there.. Waiting.  Waiting. The lady who seemed like she owned the place came by twice to see if I got mine and she yelled to the back.. About the meatball.  Nope. Saw a new table get seated next to me ten minutes later.  They ordered something. Then saw one of the staff member bring over their meatball. I was really annoyed at that.  \nFinally I just asked for the check.  Then the lady came by and said \""so you want me to wrap it up for you to go?\""  \n\nNo. I do not want you to wrap it up for me to go!  You forgot about my dish. She didn't offer any compensation.  No discount for forgetting. Horrible especially when you over look a dish and I only had two. And then you try to sell me to take it home after 25 min sitting and waiting. I had already finished my first dish a while ago and I just sat there. \n\nThen she told me(in Chinese), well you can come by next time to order that dish. You can pay for it then!  We just saved you some money today!\""\n\nNo. I will not be back to order your meatball lady."
1,"Let me start off with something positive. The two gentlemen that helped me this past week were very nice. \n\nNow for the bad...\n\nThe past two times I've been to this Subway, they've been out of something. The first time it was tuna and this past week I went in and they were literally out of all the bread! All they had was a few 6 inch pieces of bread left that I could choose from and told me that they had flatbread I could use since I was wanting a foot long. I ended up getting the last two 6\"" pieces they had left which was a white and wheat bread. To make matters even worse, the door had been left wide open to the storage unit that they keep the bread in to keep it fresh so my bread was a little stale. Next, I get to the vegis and the guy tells me that they are out of a lot of the vegetables! How does that happen, Subway! It was around 7 that I went in so it's not like you were running low because you were about to close! And not only that, but the lids that are supposed to be covering all the vegis, meat, ect. to keep them from going bad were all stacked in the middle of the bar in a huge pile! It's safe to say that I'll be going to the Subway on 24th St. and Baseline from now on."
2,"THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO BIG!!! I think its a bad thing but others love  this place. I, like most guys, hate furniture shopping but this takes it to a whole new level. You could seriously get lost in this place. It is a giant two story maze, but at the end of this maze youve spent a nominal fee for a bunch of garbage furniture or your life savings for something a little higher quality. I went in there not knowing what to expect of the place being it my first time in an ikea, yes i know i've been sheltered but in this case im very thankful. Back to the subject at hand, I went in there not knowing what i was about to get myself into. Grab the map, a paper measuring tape, and a cheap wooden pencil, just because they were free. Proceeded up the escalator to the showroom. No wonder the store has to be so big, they carry the most insane amount of furniture ive ever seen. They have such a variety of furniture which im told is good, im just a simple man. So the first hour of the store was quite exciting because their is so much furniture to loook at and \""try on\"". But then another hour passed, and another, until i looked at my watch and realized i was trapped in this god forsaken maze for 4 hours. Just as i got to the end of the showroom, my world was rocked. I thought i was finished for the day....boy was i wrong. I now had to go find the furniture i liked and get it myself. That took another solid hour bringing us up to 5 hours on the day. After I had to flag down one of the few employees that were ever visible and gathered up all the furniture came checkout. Looked like disney world. Had people directing traffic and the worst part is the self checkout. Some people act like theyve never touched a piece of technology past the creation of a speek and spell. This just added to the total amount of time spent in this store. 5 hours and 45 mins. I must say if you have the patience for shopping all day and like variety this is the place for you."
3,"I was very happy with Treasure Island.  As my yelper friends know, I did get married here and this was my first time staying at the hotel.  Check in was a breeze and we were upgraded to a view.  The hotel is laid out well, you don't have to walk a bunch through the casino to get to your rooms (one of my pet peeves).  I thought the room was very nice.  They have recently remodeled and I liked the modern look they added.  Very clean, no problems, even checked out late because there was no way I was getting out of bed at 11.  I would definitely stay again for the great price that we paid.  A lot of the properties are offering a 3rd night free! \n\nUFC fans:  They show the fights a Kahunaville!!!"
0,"Rosati's has the worst customer service.  I could not believe the way I was treated today.  I never post anything negative but I could not believe how I was treated today by the manager.  They delivered the wrong pizza so I called to have them deliver the right pizza.  The person addressing my issue on the phone was basically telling me that he couldn't do anything about it.  So I asked to speak to the manager and he told me, \""I am the manager and i'm very busy right now.\""  This is ridiculous!!  I will never place an order with Rosati's and was going to use them for catering next month for a party I'm having but will go to a different Italian restaurant.   It's very sad to have insensitive people running restaurants ...Do the owners not know what's going on?"
0,"DISHONEST STAFF & TWO SEPARATE BUNGLED HOTEL EXPERIENCES\n\nThis was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in July so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again. Actually that's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed. No call back from management. They sent an e-mail bot \""how was your stay?\"" only THEN a manager calls. I told him (Robert) my wife wouldn't be interested in returning. He pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experience.\n\nWhen I called to book, Robert did not return 3 calls that I had made requesting the room. Yes 3 calls. I then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds. I said that doesn't work for my wife and I. She then tells me one king is available but for like $35.00 more. So yes there was one available, they just want to extort some extra $. So I'm thinking, \""This place screwed up badly, begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed,\"" \n\nOn that note, integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff.  If one thing happens, well meh. 2 things happen its alarming. 3 and 4 things happen, well, I'm pissed off. The pool bartender was nice. I was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1. Yea, I hear folks screaming, \""What are you complaining about?\"" Well, it's dishonest and it's stealing. I don't like thieves and didn't ask for free drinks nor did I expect them. I never walk in to Macy's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do I? \n\nThis experience really sucks because I really really wanted to like this place as I have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill. Rooms are retro-eclectic and nice. I hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so I had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me. I understand it's an older building but staff should have said something prior. It is a LONG HAUL  from your room to go get ice. I also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some Ben & Jerrys and the server was rude. Otherwise we checked out without incidence - I thought. \n\nMy wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $50.00 charge was. So I call the hotel to inquire Kristen told me I was charged for a bottle of Belvedere Vodka. I assured her that we did not drink it. She said it would be refunded. I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said, \""Well obviously...somebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number ...or anything could have happened. But we'll get it sorted out for you.\"" I said, \""OK Please do\"" and guessed that was the end of it.  I also wasn't very satisfied with the \""anything could have happened\"" explanation. \n\nTo me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation. It's not like they don't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge. That's dishonest. My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor. \n\nI was never reimbursed.  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information. The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked, \""What was the issue?\"" and in a somewhat curt tone. I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't. He then said in a snarky fashion, \""Fine, if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa.\"" At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it. Nice way to treat your customers. \n\nWell, guess what? Yea, Brian never reversed the charges. Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't; feels really dishonest at this point. It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a \""charge dispute\"" was time consuming and once again irritating. I have much better things to do then waste time with the Hotel Valley Ho's bungling."
2,"It's a nice place to sit and eat, especially if you're staying at the Mirage. I had a turkey burger which was full of flavor and pretty thick! Their fried pickles were okay, but a little on the salty side. They were battered instead of breaded which was kinda cool, but I kept dipping in the sauce to cut the salty taste. Their fries looked good but maaaybe left in the oil a little too long. HOWEVER, they do have spiked milkshakes, which you don't come across at every diner. And they were pretty good too."
3,"Staff is always amazingly friendly. If you like In N Out, you don't need a review, just wanted to say the staff is great."
1,Flies flying around ... Flies inside the salt shaker... And the food not replenished as used to be... It's Friday night dinner most exp$$$$ and when they add the crab legs \nThey would drop on top of the new batch the left over from the previous badge ( non edible )...----taste and quality way less then used to be .... What a disappointment
2,"It was a decent hotel... nothing special. Very limited selection of craps tables it seemed. \n\nThe rooms were spacious, although they stuck me in a smoking room (I'm allergic to smoke) which sucked, until they finally switched me after the first night. Gym costs money to use (lame) and the buffet wasn't very good at all. \n\nThe location was good & the price wasn't too bad, but I'd rather pay a little more and stay elsewhere. \n\nI did however enjoy: The lions & seeing Cirque du Soleil (Ka is my fave!)\n\nUnfortunately - not a fan of the bar/club... so had to venture out for my nighttime fun."
2,"Grew up on instant ramen, had ramen in New York at some hole in the wall Japanese place where we literally got seated in a closet, found out there was a ramen place south of me in Tempe.\n\nThe staff is nice and service is quick. I had a big get together here with around 15 people and everyone got served fairly quickly. As for the food itself, it's a step up from the cups of instant noodles, but nothing special."
3,"I had a busy day at work and skipped lunch so I was starving when I came to Thai Thai.\n\nI ordered the Red Panang Curry with pork.  It may be due to the fact that I was starving but the curry tasted awesome.  \n\nPROS:  Food tasted great.  Good attentive service.  Good restaurant decor.\n\nCONS:  Bit overpriced.  $14.50 for panang curry is more than what I usually pay.  They charge for extra rice.\n\nI can't stand places that charge extra for rice.  If you are at a asian restaurant, you should never have to pay for extra rice.  I'm all for restaurants charging you for extra rice if two people want to split one dish, but if a table orders one dish per person, you should get all the rice you want.  \n\nThis place charges $2 for extra bowl of rice and it's a very small bowl of rice.  I've been at other restaurants that  do the same and it's a rip.\n\nI still gave this place 4 stars because of good food and good service."
3,"Love Joe's Grotto! Great live music and fun bar scene. Fun little patio area outside. Darts, pool, great drink specials and awesome music. Not too crowded but crowded enough. Joe is there most nights and great fun! Will be back next time in AZ!"
0,"Disappointed\n\nWe have been eating at Joe's for years, and it's always been one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas due to the excellent food and service.  My husband proposed to me there in 2010.  We went there last week (on the 4th anniversary of our engagement).  My husband told the maitre'd it was a special occasion, which he ignored and said \""tell your waiter\"" (which we did).\nWe arrived at 7 p.m.   We were rushed to order.  Our food arrived within 5 minutes (we were having cold crab legs and hot sides).  It was faster than McDonalds.  We were never asked if we would like coffee or dessert and the anniversary of our engagement was totally forgotten.  We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m. 30 minutes after sitting down.  There were many empty tables, so the rush was very weird. Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap, either.  Won't be back any time soon"
1,"Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is BC I liked their coleslaw and pickles. Boyfriend and I got the teriyaki chicken wrap and burger. \""Teriyaki\"" was loaded with canned pineapple and a super liquidy  sauced that soaked the wrap and made it soggy. Also strange that it was covered in black sesame seeds. Burger was nothing special, tasted like something I could get at McDonalds. For a place that claims to be very particular about their food they didn't care much about  flavor or presentation. Wouldn't recommend."
4,"Wonderfully delicious pizza! I am a huge fan of thin crust and this is the best! I love the meatball pizza...it is to die for  I am not a huge fan of their salads...missing a little something, maybe it is the lack of stuff other than lettuce, but I still give the place a five star review."
0,"This place has no concept of good customer service. Brought a machine in for maintenance and repair, returned to me with same problem PLUS a new one.  There is no way they could have missed the new problem if they were paying attention. \n\nWhen I brought it back not only did I not get an apology for it not being fixed or having a new problem, my machine was put back at the end of the line of other repairs.   When I asked if it was done yet, I was told they are busy with other repairs. \n\nIf you are supposed to fix something and don't, you put it at the front of the line and make sure you fix it before you work on any other machines. That's only common sense and good customer service. I'd be out if business if I treated my clients like that. \n\nHad my machine for way too long. Would have been longer if I didn't keep calling and bugging them. \n\nAfter weeks of this crap they finally said it needed a part (which they should have known when I first brought it).  Part never came in but they never checked on why they never received it until I called and asked them to call and find out. Ended up having to resend the part. \n\nMy machine never did work right - still had same problem but there is no way I was going to bring it back.  I had another company fix it.  it took them 2 days and it works perfectly!\n\nWill NEVER do business with again. Felt like an invaluable customer the first time I went in a year ago so I should have know better.\n\nNow that I tell people I hear other stories about the bad service that was received there.  Wish I would have heard that first!"
3,"Best grilled cheese I have ever had. I've tried the one with leeks and mushrooms (can't remember the name), and it was good, but I can't get away from the Pig Mac! Kettle chips weren't anything special when we ordered them, but still not bad. They accept credit cards and service is pretty friendly, even when they're busy. I'd give 5 stars to the sandwiches easily, 4 stars overall.\n\nDefinitely recommend, and we'll be back ourselves!"
2,Im a fan.  Their sliders are really good and the atmosphere is cool also.  If you go there during the day you can see the Real Housewives of North Scottsdale.
2,I know my que. \nThis is crap. The only thing authentic is the mess you make cuz they only give you a slab of tin foil as a plate.\nCheap ass bun. Cheap ass sauce taste like a jug from costco.\nWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY TOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE CHEAP ASS PORTIONS.
2,"We stayed here on a summer special, because we had business to take care of in Phoenix the next day.  The room was a basic suite room, clean and comfortable, but smaller than we expected from the photos on the website.  I would not suggest trying to put any more than two adults in that room, and probably not more than one smaller child.  The kitchen area was quite spacious and very nice.  The courtyard and pool area were gorgeous, and it's easy to see why this would be a popular place for outdoor weddings.  The thing that set it apart from other suite hotels was the decorations and appointments.  Actual artwork on the walls, very nice mattress and sheets, and pleasant colors.  The only drawbacks were the sheer number of decorative  items that took up nearly every horizontal surface, and the typically small sized \""hotel\""  towels. The evening hors d'oeuvre buffet was pretty underwhelming, basically a salad and taco bar on the night we were there, and the dining area was crowded with families and lots of kids, so not a very \""relax and unwind\""  environment.  We felt satisfied with at the summer special rate, but perhaps not so much at regular winter rates. (Trivial, but we got only one of the two bears and none of the chocolate chip cookies that were promised with the summer rate package.) Overall the hotel itself was quite nice, but the service and attention to detail was less than the property seemed to promise."
0,"I love Carolina's. Just not yesterday, November 11th, @1:45pm at the Mohave St. location. Just to be sure. \n\nNow, it's not my fault I only have 30 minutes for lunch so I went to Carolina's at the Mohave St location and I ordered a taco and enchilada, both beef. 14 minutes later my food arrived. The place was not crowded and that's too long for a taco and enchilada.  My God, there's 10 people - minimum - in the damn kitchen...\n\nSO SLOW AT THIS LOCATION. This horribly slow service has NEVER occurred at the Cactus or Sun City locations and I've been eating there for years\n\nThe taco was delicious, the enchilada not so much.  Three small cubes of beef in the whole enchilada!  The corn tortilla was old and tough. Or very tough and old. There was lots of gravy (red sauce) which is good, but not to cover the less-than-minimum amount of beef. It's not a beef enchilada if it doesn't have any beef. \n\nBut the really bad news is the food made me ill: 90 minutes later: Cramps, diarrhea.   And I've got a cast-iron stomach so it isn't me it, was the food. \n\nSo let's review what we learned: slow service, 1 hit 1 BIG miss on the $8 taco/enchilada/soda they-ain't-giving- anything-away package , that, oh, by the way, made me ill.  thanks for nuthin'!\n\nNever again this location.  You either if you're smart."
2,"Mixed reviews.\n\nSome of my friends absolutely loved their meals.  They felt that it was some of the best scrambled eggs they ever had.  Me, either I ordered the wrong thing or I'm just more discerning, the food was just okay.  To be honest, it is very hard to impress me with breakfast fare.  The ambiance is nice - spacious and clean.  Our waiter was spectacular - very diligent and friendly.  Portions were decent.  \n\nCan't go wrong especially if you don't expect (I'll resist the easy pun) much."
2,"Joli petit bistro situ\u00e9 au m\u00e9tro place des arts, en face de l'endroit ou jadis se trouvait le spectrum. \n\nLe d\u00e9cor est moderne et accueillant, un peu lounge. L'accueil est chaleureux. La vue sur le quartier des spectacles est superbe !\nNous ne savons pas trop que prendre, alors nous demandons conseil au serveur, qui ne semble pas trop passionn\u00e9 par quelque chose en particulier. Soit qu'il n'a pas go\u00fbt\u00e9 ou bien il n'aime pas. \nNous optons pour les calmars frits en entr\u00e9e, servis avec une mayonnaise maison, qui sont LES MEILLEURS que j'ai eu la chance de manger. Il s'agit de VRAIS morceaux de calmar enrob\u00e9s d'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re panure de style tempura. Aucun go\u00fbt caoutchouteux, j'aime \u00e7a !\n\nPour le repas principal, je choisis la bavette. Elle est assez ordinaire, sans saveur et la  pi\u00e8ce n'est pas tellement tendre. \n\nLe prix dudit repas est assez dispendieux pour un steak moyen et des calmars. Je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais bien franchement. Probablement pour un 5 a 7, mais pas pour le repas. Ils ont de bons sp\u00e9ciaux apr\u00e8s 22h, mais c'est un peu tard pour moi."
3,I went there for some emergency service for my car.     (I believe I ran over a metal soccer ball on I-79 during rush hour in the middle lane - I did get high score for the day ;-) )\n\nWell they were the bearer of bad news for my car (just a lot of work) but I liked that they took pictures of everything that needed done then allowed me to go up and visually look at the issues while the car is on the lift.\n\nMy car will be there for a while getting some TLC - but who can beat their $2 per day rental...   (There is no typo - $2 per day) for a rental Mercedes...  (which is great while I eat macaroni and cheese for the next few weeks ;-) )\n\nI will update my review once I get my car back - but I am not expecting anything less than the best since Rahal is the owner (Indy Racing)...
4,"Amazing little spot, hidden in the small town of Tolleson. The guacamole is awesome! Perfect amount of spice and obviously made from scratch unlike some places. It reminds me of my own home made guac, so I must be doing something right!\n\nCheap and delicious food all around, it is my new favorite local mexican joint to grab lunch at."
3,"Quiet storm is a really cool vegetarian restaurant. The time I was there the service was fine and the food was unique. Their menu is a limited on the weekdays, your best bet is one of their many quesadillas.\n\nI'm not as concerned about the preservation of vibe and atmosphere, as long as the food still tastes good. I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.\n\nI wrote a review of Quiet Storm on my web site, Binge! http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/07/07/ive-got-an-itch-for-kitsch-quiet-storm-in-bloomfield/"
3,"Suck it up.  I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I love their quirky drink names, the sleek packaging, and how there's more than just boba [gobi poppers and nunu yummies] you can add into the drinks but man do I hate the way they run things!  \n\nThis place is always busy and the line spews well past their awkwardly placed pillar and into the rest of the food court.  They should probably utilize some kind of name system or order number because if you're not paying attention, someone can walk away with your drinks.  Two smooch-sized [large] drinks costs about $12 which is like $2 more per drink than any other boba house around the valley but you pay for the convenience of having bubble tea inside a nicer shopping mall.  \n\nSince it's always so busy, their bobas are always soft and chewy --- I dig the freshness.  I'm loving the yogurt gobi poppers.  Explosive!  Another good thing about the place is you can choose what kind of sweetener and creamer for them to use.   Truvia?  Non-dairy creamer?  Yes please!  The menu isn't as large as everyone says but since they did go with a clever naming system, you can't just go, \""I want a taro boba.\""  You would have to comb through the menu and see that it's called a Purple Haze.  This can be a bit confusing but you'll get the hang of it.\n\nAnyways, Boba Tea Company is definitely a trendier bubble tea place and I'll probably come back again and again when I feel like standing around for 15 minutes to order and receive some drinks.  YOGURT GOBI!  WOO!\n\n[You still owe me a drink, Bretters.  I'm putting you on Blast!]"
3,"Same as every other Jamba Juice. My biggest problem with JJ is how long it takes to get your drink. If there is a line in front of you at all - it's going to take a REALLY long time. When there is no line, you still wait and wait because you cannot tell how many people have placed their orders in front of you. \n\nLove their new lower sugar items. Thanks JJ"
1,"Today was my first visit to this new business. The outside is painted a bright light blue and is very inviting. The inside is very clean and new and has nice tables and comfy chairs. Staff was friendly and professional.\n\n Now- on to the food. I opened the menu and was presented with voluminous of all but impossible to read and understand items. The entire thing is in spanish with english subtitles printed in a white/black reverse over all these photos of the food--it might get clearer after a margarita or two. It was so confusing and hard to understand.\n\n Like many new restaurants they are obviously experiencing growing pains with trial & error. There are no traditional combination platters available but rather all the different food categories are listed out separate. \n\n I ordered a tacos, the chicken was pretty good, grilled and nicely pulled, but the carne asada was inedible, it was almost 100% comprised of gristle and sinew, and sadly, had zero seasoning. The \""spanish rice\"" is not spanish and is just white rice with frozen mixed veg (carrot, corn, peas, beans) added to it--very strange and unappetizing.  Even the salsa verde was lacking, this is just ground up pickled jalape\u00f1os and does NOT compliment the food one bit.\n\nI HATE giving such bad reviews on a new business, I want them to succeed, we need a great mexican restaurant in Monona, but unless they make some sweeping changes and soon, their days are clearly numbered, sorry to say."
1,"My fav mall???? No, but it has two stores that I do adore and when im in a rush this place is the one to stop by since you can get in and out relatively quick. It a mall, but not the greatest but nonetheless still a mall."
1,"One of the weirdest casinos I've ever been to in my life.\nThey don't have craps and their blackjack has the shadiest system I've ever encountered in my life.\nWe were touring and just wanted to have a good time,but they don't even offer free drinks there.\nTry something else if you're in Arizona."
0,Hair in food.\nThe end.
2,"I have high hopes for this place.  It's currently under construction so they haven't renovated the rooms yet, but I like their casino.  It's well lit (unlike MGM) and they play good music.  The room is still in its Aladdin state and it's just blah.  The room doesn't ventilate well and the layout is all funky.  There also isn't much of a pool area.  It's more like a roofdeck of a parking lot so hopefully they will fix this and make it all nice."
0,"Management is awful. We had a reservation for 9 pm and were there at 8:45 Pm, but we were not seated till 11 PM. By the time we got table we were tired of standing and waiting, so we just wanted to finish our dinner as soon as possible and crash in the hotel room. I won't recommend this place to anyone, if you are planning this restaurant for your date please reconsider. View from this restaurant is not worth the torture you have to go through"
2,"My friend and I dropped in for cocktails and to listen to the band on Wednesday night.  Loved the martinis and the music.  I am knocking off two stars because our server was arrogant and unfriendly.  No smile, no greeting.  She brought the check faster than she took our drink order.  We all have bad days, but servers should leave their attitudes at the door prior to their shift."
4,This is hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas in my opinion. Their horchata is some of the best I have tasted. They have Mexican corn on the cob that I would drive hours for just to eat. The staff is very friendly and it's in an amazing location. I would highly recommend this place to everyone!
0,"Holy God, I should have checked the reviews before eating here. Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice.\n\nI'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty.\n\nThis was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that.\n\nI love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option. If you need me, I'm brushing up on my cartography."
3,"The family and I dined at Aquaknox our second night in Vegas.  For those who have never been there, it is located in the Venetian.  First impression:  very soothing colors in shades of blue, green and cream.  They have a really cool little private dining room with seating for about 4 or 5 inside a round glass wine display.  Imagine dining with bottles and bottles of wine surrounding you.  ;)  They have a few pretty water displays too.  \n\nThe restaurant was not very busy, but to be honest, Vegas itself seemed pretty empty this trip.  The economy perhaps?  Anyway, our waiter and busboy were both very pleasant and helpful.  We had three coupons for complimentary Aquatinis...don't mind if we do!  It was a very pretty drink, but a little too sweet for my taste.  \n\nI split the beet salad with my sister.  It was served with a rather sweet dressing.  Thank goodness for the blue cheese crumbles which did a great job balancing out the sweetness.  I found several entrees on the menu that sounded really good, but I chose the grouper.  It was rice crusted and served over green tea-infused soba noodles.  As separates, everything was very tasty, but together it was a rather odd combo of flavors.  If I went back I would probably order the scallops like my dad or the John Dory like my mom and sister.  \n\nWe all split a Lemon Crush dessert which was excellent.  It consisted of the most amazing lemon cake, a little round cookie on top of the cake and a scoop of ice cream.  The presentation of all of our dishes was very pleasing."
4,"I really don't the words to explain how AMAZING..no wait...INCREDIBLE...no no, the word is ASTONISHING.  okay i really don't have the words.  I fell in love with the show, i suggest anyone that likes even just one beatles song, to see this show.  the choreography was beautiful and amazing and totally goes with the whole beatles theme, look, or whatever you want to call it.  compared to other cirque de soleil shows, yea it doesn't have as much acrobatics, but seriously this show is more about the music.  \n\nthe only thing i would suggest is probably get a seat that is more in the back.  not only would you see the whole stage, but they also do this cool stunt with a huge white sheet, and for sure you want to see the whole thing, and not be under the white sheet haha.  \n\nanother suggestion...buy your ticket day of!!  my party and i spontaneously wanted to see it and looked around online for discounted tickets.  we found tickets that were half off, and were at amazing spots.  \n\ni fell in love with the beatles again and i seriously have a new appreciation for them as well."
0,Fish was chewy. Pasta was good but filling tasted like dirt.  We sent back the beef cheek ravioli. Service was great but would not go back because food was terrible.
0,"I don't think we would do business with these slippery characters again !!  Not only were they difficult and refused to fix their errors when we bought the blinds from them.   Now, when there are issues with the function of the shades, they refuse to come out for service without charging a fee up front.   What a joke !!!"
2,"Its just what everyone one says, old and filled with the LV neighborhood. Great place to experience and see the old Vegas. Beer is cheap and be careful what you order for food. ( I got sick) :(. Don't think I'll go back, for the money I spent on vacationing in Las Vegas. I'll stay with the strip!"
4,"This gym is immaculate! The staff is friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. The equipment is clean and well maintained. They have great classes. However, my absolute favorite thing about this gym is that they have an outdoor pool AND an outdoor grassy area for boot camps! \nYou should definitely check out this club. Additional perks... there's a Fresh & Easy in the same plaza and a tanning salon across the way."
3,"I am wavering between a 3 and 4 stars, but will default to 4 because the food really was fantastic. \nThe wife and I ventured to Frank & Fina's at the recommendation of a vegan friend who noted their great vegetarian menu. \nThe place is on the small side compared to most Mexican joints in town, but it was a clean, and decorated better than much of its competition. The prices were consistent with other top notch Mexican eateries, and the service was good noting how busy the place was. \nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were pretty standard, but the salsa was really good. Very fresh, and not too chunky, but definitely not watery. \nEvery day that have different vegetarian specials, so this is really a shining star for us vegetarians that have to ask questions all the time to make sure we are good with the food.\nI had the veggie enchiladas with both red and green sauce, the wife had a hard and soft veggie taco. Both entrees were really good and very flavorful. I liked how the potatoes (yes, potatoes)  and zucchini in both the tacos and enchiladas were cooked. I liked the red sauce more than the green, but that is almost universally the case for me. The black beans were very good, but really salty, and the rice was perfectly cooked, not watery, not slimy but firm and well seasoned. \nWe also had mojitos, which were very tasty and pretty strong.  \n\nMy only complaint was that the food was super salty, and we could feel that during the rest of our evening. We will definitely be back to sample more of their veggie fare. Also, we noted that both dishes would have been amazing even without cheese, which is not the case for every Mexican place we eat."
0,"This is the second and last time I will be thoroughly disappointed in Rice Paper.  I couldn't figure out who was my server, two guys and a gal alternated, no names given.  My first interaction after being seated by the pleasant gal was with a surprised looking guy who tongue-tiedly only could muster,\"" oh do you know what you want?\"" I ordered the Saigon/Bun--it's a salad with grilled pork and rice vermicelli.  It came in a large bowl which was loaded with shredded lettuce, ample pork, julienned cucumber, bean sprouts, and about a tablespoon of vermicelli at the very bottom.  There was so little noodle that I asked a server, \""is there vermicelli in here?\"" and had to stir the salad a good minute before I could even find a few strands.  He did bring a small plate of vermicelli for me to add, upon seeing how little the chef had put in.  As I was eating I noticed that there was not the typical subtle mint flavor I'm used to in Bun.  So, the next time the server came around I asked, \""isn't there supposed to be mint in here?\"" He said he didn't know but looked at a menu and sure enough, mint was on the list of ingredients. He brought me a small bowl of wilted mint, which I used.  Thank goodness the sauce was tasty or there would have been little to redeem this salad.  They ALSO FORGOT to include the \""crispy shallots and peanuts\"" that were supposed to be in the salad too.  I didn't know this til I got home and re-examined the menu.  I just knew something else was missing, because usually Bun is an explosion of flavors.  I thought $10 was way too much to pay for what I got, not to mention the strange service.  OH and get this! My bill came to $10.83. I gave the guy $15 and he came back with $4, saying \""I rounded up to $4.\""  I said \""oh, ok thanks,\"" but then I realized that he stiffed me .17.  I mean yeah, big deal, .17.  But come on, how cheesy is that, to make change off of your customer's pocket book!! It's laughable how bad this lunch experience was.  And the tamarind sauce splattered high up on the window moulding in front room didn't help.  This place is stupid."
2,"Ohhh sweets and bright colors are my weaknesses. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? Yes please! \n\nWalking by the Sugar Factory on the strip was too enticing to pass up. This one, located outside Paris, is a fairly larger candy store then the other two locations (at the Mirage and the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops). \n\nTrue, most everything in here is really overpriced. But there are some cool things to look at. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? So tempted to buy. They have some cool novelty items, like couture pops, charm bracelets, hello kitty chocolate bars. I also found some key lime chocolate bars that looked interesting. Sugar factory has their own line of chocolate bars (2 for $5). I ended up picking up a 30 day supply of chocolate squares ($18). The squares are the size you'd see at Ghirardelli, and they come in a variety of flavors (milk, dark, raspberry, smores, caramel). Oh and did I mention cool packaging? It was a gift for my bf, but I'm eating a lot of it. Sharing is caring! =)\nThe chocolates are really good actually. The quality is up and there and the taste is really smooth without being too sweet. \n\nOh and the candy store has a gelato/ice cream shake bar. My friend wanted a scoop of gelato. One scoop is $6. Eeek. And the scoop was tiny! We tried the panna cotta. It was way too sweet! I don't think this place is worth it for a frozen treat fix. I'll pass next time. \n\nWhile I was at the store, I also noticed that it was attached to a dessert boutique. Didn't get to try it, but definitely want to next time. The dessert boutique and the candy store is open 24 hours!"
2,This is now out of business.
3,"We had the opportunity to use Desert Cab for our trip from Royal Links to our hotel on the strip (Four Seasons). Our driver, Mr. Barnes, was very friendly, courteous and engaging. He even got my husband talking - which is a feat in itself! He made the $35 cab ride go by quickly and comfortably. Thanks for the great service!"
4,Been a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright for many years. I've visited Falling water and Knob Hill (which is simply fantastic) both in Pennsylvania. Also toured his home and other locations in Chicago. I've yet to be disappointed. The guides are always extremely knowledgeable and they have great anecdotes which help to make the tours fun. My parents have recently moved down (snow birds) to Arizona and I look forward to taking the tour again in the future.  \n\nIt is expensive...actually when I went last year my parent's waffled on whether to spend the money because they weren't terribly interested.  In the end they decided to go and they were fascinated and glad they took the tour. It's worth it to support Taliesin and the conservation of these wonderful works of art.
0,I felt $20 was way too much for a hand wash to begin with. The guy said he would also armor all the tires and vacuum the car which they did not. Also when I left and got home there was still gunk stuck to the car. They did a horrible job and I will never go back.
3,"Great place to go with your friends! Had a frozen raspberry big azz marg which was excellent. My friend and I split the nachos which was a good idea-- the portion was huge. The only downside of this place is the size, had to wait forty minutes for a table for four. Always crowded on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Ambiance is nice, but get here early if you want a table!"
1,I was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food. What I got was a plate full of super-salty rice and beans. I couldn't finish it and left hungry. I'm hoping it was just a mistake. I'll give it another try one of these days.
1,The 509 Cafe no longer serves lunch or breakfast
0,Came to mini to look at a mini and the sales man was so rude I about punched him in the face. So then I go talk to the manager and explain to him what happen and then the salesman goes inside and tells everyone what happened and they turn around and look at me through the window and start laughing I would never come to many of Las Vegas to purchase a vehicle
1,"I dig dive bars but this spot is nasty.  Lots of fans keep the stale, something's not right here, air blowing.  My drink tasted off.  Worst of all, false advertising, no bikinis in sight.  Bar tender was pleasant and drink prices were reasonable so they get 2 stars but that's pushing it."
1,"I am always out for a good breakfast place so I was happy to have a new one near our home in downtown Phoenix. Unfortunately my husband and I were pretty disappointed with our food. The Coffee was awesome but the food was way too greasy and way too salty, I felt sick the rest of the day. This all coming from someone who typically likes salty food. I realize breky can be a greasy treat but this was too much fat and salt for my taste. \nWe tried it again to give it a second chance and went with a friend who happened to be a Vegan. There was nothing on the menu she could eat. It's 2013 ya gotta be a little accommodating to other peoples food restrictions in a restaurant. So, two strikes and you're out in my book."
3,Great Japanese restaurant for the area!  The sushi was delicious and the happy hour special of $1.50 off all drinks is nice too!  They overcharged me for the Saki but were very willing and gracious to change it on my bill.  Highly recommend it.
3,"Yogurtini is a funny place. \n\nIf you're a health conscious person, you can eat some very healthy ice cream and feel bad at the same time, as people take what is normally considered a healthy snack, and pile it up with neon gummy worms, chocolate syrup, cream puffs, and oodles of sprinkles. \n\nThe store is weight based, meaning that what you pay is entirely in your hands. You can do what I do, which is around $3, or you can go for the \""All American\"" and end up paying $7-$8 for the Chocolate Syrup drenched Cream Puffs and marshmallow cereal with a tiny amount of chocolate yogurt. \n\nFlavor wise, they run the gamut, and flavors generally change. I prefer mixing flavors, usually being guilty of mixing something with birthday cake flavor, then topping it with fruity pebbles & 1 cream puff. \n\nIt's a tasty treat, but by no means don't come here looking for \""healthy\"" desert. You'll just end up ruining your diet."
2,"The gym is showing it's age. Nothing bad but nothing great.  With a hotel like the venetian, i wished they would have updated the gym with modern equipments."
1,"For the same room rate, I prefer Vdara.\nVdara 's room is twice bigger than Aria.\nCheck-in at Aria takes about 45 min in line, long line and slow service.\nAria has no Business Center to fax or print boarding pass. Vdara has. but close at 5pm.\nAria room is half the size of Vdara for the same price.\nAria has no fridge, no dinning table, no 2 TVs, \nAria has better pool area than Vdara, Vdara pools are crowded.\nAria has buffet , its pretty good, they have crab legs for lunch. Vdara has no restaurant.\n\nHowever, Vdara has no casino, no restaurant, but its is just next to Aria ( connected )\nI take Vdara anytime."
0,"What a spectacular disappointment. The Ruben is cold, untoasted, and devoid of flavor. To call this place a deli is like calling McDonald's a burger joint."
3,"Ordered Chasu Bowl while my boyfriend ordered Kimchi Fried Rice and Shoyu Ramen. Everything was so good and good portions. It's such an incredibly small place though. No reservations, wait could be extremely long if its busy."
4,"Great time at the Children's Museum! Our 5 year old loved the \""Noodle Room\"", the 7 year old really enjoyed the \""Art Studio\"".  We packed a lunch and enjoyed ourselves in the shade outside!  We will definitely be back!"
2,"I am only giving this place 3 stars due to the a-hole stick man at the craps table from last Sunday.  I try to visit old Las Vegas on each trip i make to the sin city.  I actually like Four Queens.  If you go on Sunday morning you can get a cheap buffet in old Vegas and then gamble very cheap at some of these old casinos.\n\nI have played roulette, 21, let it ride and craps here as well as the slots at the bar.\n\nI have won money, got comped meals and i have lost money.  I know how to play craps.  But this dealer last week was just rude.  I was asking for change when a non english speaking shooter through early and hit my hand.  The stick guy said to take my money, the boss and the rest of the dealers disagreed thankfully.  No one else even had bets down.  There was an over eager shooter and jack *** on the stick.  \n\nI really do like this place and will be back, hopefully i dont run into that one guy again.\n\nAlso, there is a great bartender who is a big fan of the San Fransico 49ers.  He is a great guy to talk to about about whats going on for the local scene."

0,"I hadn't been to Frank & Lupe's for more than a year when I met a potential client there for lunch today.\nI don't embarrass easily...just look at the fact that I post my actual picture on my Yelp profile. I come from stout Norwegian stock (you want to talk about an internal compass that is seldom right but never uncertain and always unconcerned, it's the good Norwegian wood - gratuitous Beatles reference - that I spring from).\nBut, jeez, I was embarrassed today!\nI remember this place as being better than this! Do I have early onset \""old-timers\"" disease? Is my fondness for happy hours just the beginnings of a craving for \""early bird specials\""? I don't know.\nI got there a few minutes early and was seated and got chips and salsa (both the regular and the hot..I like the hot, but you never know about other peoples taste). So far so good...decent chips and decent salsa, although I seem to remember the chips being warm the last time I was here.\nIt went downhill from there. My lunch meeting arrived and we chatted as we waited for our server to come and take her drink order...and waited...and waited. He finally looked at us (could it have been my frantic waving?), and dropped by the table to find out what all the fuss was about. Took her drink order and asked what we wanted  for lunch. We hadn't decided and that earned us a sniff and spin, and off he went. Another server brought her drink and we looked at the menu's while we talked business and waited for our server to return...and waited...and waited.\nI just want to iterate that it just wasn't that busy today...maybe 12-15 total tables, in and out, with 3 servers, so not a heavy load. Our server finally returned after another stint of waving (I had my workout this morning, but I got in a little extra upper body at F&L). \nHe took our orders and we waited...and waited.\nMy fish taco's came out, and we waited for my lunch companions Holy Mole'...and waited...and waited. 5 minutes and I motioned to him (less waving this time...he was looking anxiously between us and the kitchen by now). I asked him to take my order back to the kitchen and keep it warm until both orders could be brought out together...he didn't. Instead he said the mole was coming right out, which it did (if by \""right out\"" he meant 4 minutes from now).\nThis might have all been OK, if the food had been what I thought I remembered...it wasn't...it was worse...way worse.\nThe fish in the taco's was not fresh...little tiny chunks of fish that clearly came out of a can. I tried all three tacos, and there was some variation in the flavors, but not from the fish.\nThe mole may have been worse. I don't know, but for someone who was looking forward to the mole to give up after a half dozen bites was not a good sign.\nYou know, it's never a good idea to have a prospective business relationship see you switch into full jerk mode over something as trivial as a crappy lunch (although I was sorely tempted), so I paid the bill, we continued our conversation and I will probably not get to pick the restaurant the next time we dine together. \nBut it was a successful lunch in the business sense.\nI try to \""vote local\"" with my dining and entertainment dollars, and I don't expect perfection, but could some of these places at least try? Canned fish in the tacos...really?!?!?! I don't think my memory is faulty...I think it was better, and I know I was looking forward to having lunch there today.\nJeez...this was embarrassing!"
2,"We met my aunt, unlce, dad, step mom, and in-laws there for dinner with our 1 year old along with us.  The place has a family atmosphere, lots and lots of little ones.  The service was quick and courteous.  The food was about what you'd expect from a chain like this:  generous portions, tasty prep (if not inspired), chain-like recipes and menu.  I had ribs and a mojito, which hit the spot.  Plenty of rum, a tad heavy on the lime, plenty of mint."
0,"I really, really, really wanted to like this place and hope they can work the kinks out and stay in business. However, it's a long shot if they keep their current manager. \n\nI've been here twice, once with my hubby on date night; looking for a romantic place to enjoy a glass of wine and some much needed convo. Manager sauntered over, had a seat in our cosy corner and proceeded to complain to us about his employees and how much more work that put on him! Well, you're the manger yo!\n\nNext visit, I brought my family. We did not know ahead of time, but they were having a free wine tasting hosted by this same manager.  He wrongly assumed that we were wine newbies and arrogantly shared his vision to bring wine education to our community through his hand selected wine list... Which of course, wasn't the same wine list he would choose for himself. When not serving wine behind his wine barrel tasting station, he sat playing on his phone. Yikes!\n\nI wish I could say the food made up for the poor experience, however the bruschetta (low cost, high profit item) we all shared, was flavorless. Hummus was the highlight. \n\nOverall look and feel of the place is clubby and warm. Unfortunately, cheap table chairs, while nice looking, are uncomfortable. \n\nEven though this place is needed and welcome in my neighborhood... They need to bump it up!"
0,"I needed Italian bread for an event so there was no choice except to buy the bread that was available. The bakery had plenty of Italian bread but therein lies the problem- I buy Italian bread on an almost weekly basis so I know the way it's supposed to look as well as cost. For about the third maybe fourth time now the bread yeast hasn't risen all the way. It looks like squashed sourdough bread instead of Italian bread. Instead of about 4\""-5\"" it's about 2\"" thick. To add insult to injury the bread even costs more during the times it was thinner. Instead of the bread costing $2.49 just like any other day it cost $2.69 when it's thinner. Does that make any sort of logical sense? I am disappointed and this review is emotional in nature but there are actual facts here as well."
4,Basil was my first experience in Thai food. Let me tell you - it set the bar as high as possible. This place has AMAZING food and the decor/atmosphere/staff are great. If you visit Charlotte or live here and haven't yet - go ASAP.\n\nPersonally I sometimes just order 2 appetizers for myself as a meal. If I'm feeling really hungry I grab a plate of Pad Thai. \n\nAlso this a great place to grab a quick drink to start off the night on 5th street.
4,"Excellent quick service. Went in on 12/31/14\nwas told my car wasn't going to pass because of horn before he even pulled it into garage. He explained what I needed to do to get it up to par, so I went next door to Auto-Zone, had the part put in he inspected and everything was great. I saw someone posted they only gave 4 stars because it's no frills; it's not but it is good honest people who know their stuff and do a good job. I'll take that over frills ANYDAY! Highly recommend!"
1,"I took my mom and sister out for sushi one night. We stopped by this Ah-So location because we were nearby. However, we ended up going to their other location.\n\nThey only have two regular tables and all of the others are high stools. I realize the high stools and tables are trendy, but they aren't practical or considerate of all patrons (e.g., for older patrons a high stool is not easy to get on and off). In addition, the two regular tables were near a drafty door and a large sign that had the nightly specials was right against one of the regular tables. Anyway, needless to say we ended up leaving because the atmosphere did not feel welcoming and we wanted to celebrate a family special occasion. \n\nI'm not sure about the quality of food since we didn't even make it to a table. But their other location was good and accommodating."
3,"All you really need to know about Cugino's (if you're a New Yorker) is that they sell Tower Isle Jamaican beef patties. Score!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of their pizza (I'd say it's above-average by Vegas standards), but I love the sausage and peppers hero. The garlic knots are good too. I was disappointed with the boxes of assorted cookies; they just tasted off to me.\n\nThey carry Boars Head cold cuts, a big plus. My next trip there, I'll see if they know how to slice the stuff (yeah, I've found Boars Head elswhere in Vegas, but just try and get it sliced paper thin)."
1,"This is only in reference to the veggie burrito:  Stick with the meats.  The Veggie burrito costs more than the fish and equal to the other meats (wha???), but serves up less... The beans are flavorful, but other than that it's just the boring standards, too much rice, a few slices of peppers and onions, some cheese, and a couple shreds of lettuce... I wish I had paid less and grabbed the mahi-mahi again..."
0,"EXREMELY disappointed after spending 4 hours for a color corrector and highlight. Walked out after paying $240 for a service that was horrible. Was told that he was \""amazing\"" by the receptionist who booked my appointment. My hair was just a frizzy mess when I left and no style was done. I will NEVER return or recommend this place to anyone. I will not say his name because I'm sure there are some great workers in there. Customer Service was fine it was the end result that sucked!!! After showing a picture of what I wanted he didn't even come CLOSE to my request."
4,"First I would like to say as a customer:\nThese are some of the friendliest and most knowledgeable people you'll meet. I shop here for both personal projects and work related. Scott, specifically, is the last gentlemen that helped me out here. I was in search of card stock and envelopes for my wedding limitations. This place had everything and then some. He helped me out getting what I needed, kept the price very reasonable. I was amazed at how integrated their ordering process was for stuff not in stock. They didn't have the envelopes I needed for the invitations, however their Tucson store did. Within 10 minutes he had processed a rush order for the matching envelopes to my card stock and was able to get it within a day and a half from Tucson. Not only that, but there was no charge for the rush order. AWESOME!\n\nSecond, as a designer:\nThis place has all the stock you could possibly want. If they don't have it in store, they can get it for you. Every time I've been here they have given me tips for printing with specialized paper, especially vellum because that gets tricky with digital press. They know their stuff. I will definitely be going here for all my paper needs!"
2,"I've been going Ambrosia since Winter of  2009.  Not sure if it's changed ownership,but recently some menu items have changed or been deleted. Plus the wait staff seems to get younger and dumber.  A few months back  their was a kind experienced  woman waitress. They seemed to replace her with some kid who probably previously  worked at McDonalds.\n\nNot only did they replace the good waitress . When you ask for water they bring it in a cocktail glass with two straws! Maybe they ran out of tall cups that night. lol. I don't know..\n\nAs for the food,it's great!  But I would recommend take out oppose to dine in."
2,"This place is always just okay. The food is okay, the service is okay, the whole experience is really just okay. I had the seafood enchilada tonight and again, it was just okay. I never think to go here because it's forgettable."
3,I always receive great food from here. We find quick seating and receive our food about 15 minutes after ordering. I always order the Bon.
1,"We've purchased tires from Discount Tire before...we've purchased tires from this location before. \n \nOn the plus side:\n- this location took care of the tire that needed repair. \n- the rep suggested that I leave the spare (a full-size tire - not a donut) where it was and, for 'safety reasons', use the repaired tire where a badly worn was.\n\nAfter agreeing to the rep's suggestion, the badly worn tire was to go back in the trunk.  But I would have thought that it would have been placed back properly - in the compartment with the cover placed over it.  INSTEAD, they just put the worn tire into the AAA bag the flat tire was in and just threw it into the trunk! WOW, really???\n\nSorry, you didn't convince me to purchase two brand new tires the day of my visit but service is service!   \n\nAfter this experience, we probably won't shop here again."
3,"Seriously, some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Come for the lunch specials! It's like $7 and it comes with soup, a fried wonton, and a veggie egg roll. You can choose from like 8 different items I think.\n\nFor the lunch special, I had the pad thai and the boyfriend got red curry and we shared..The red curry was simply DIVINE. You can choose your spiciness level from 1 - 10. We got 8, which was perfect. \n\nAnother thing you need to try is the fried ice cream. Nothing like tempura ice cream..the outside fried part reminds me of a churro with a smoother texture.\n\nOverall, my experience here was great. The servers are also dressed up in traditional Thai dresses and are very polite."
2,"\""Is there anything else we can help you with?\"" We were asked this question repeatedly Friday night. Arriving for a 7:30pm reservation we had our pick of tables as there weren't many diners. Given the choice we eagerly sat in an available booth. We both sat on the cushioned seating against the wall. Given our experience I'd recommend sticking with standard chairs, for reasons you may, or may not agree with. \n\n\""Are you ready to order?\""\nBelly dancing is from 7-9pm (ended earlier). A wonderful show is put on near the stage. Tables in the center part of the restaurant (and the booths) have prime viewing. As this was my first visit I fastidiously reviewed the drink menu. To my delight there was a curious mix of drinks available. Margaritas. Long Island Ice Teas. Martinis. J\u00e4germeister - Yeah. That was on there. As a drink. Neat. Nothing quite traditional sounding so I went with wine. In the meantime a glass of water was brought out.\n\n\""Can we help you?\""\n\""Are you ready to order?\""\n\nErm- We'd just opened the drink menus. \nNot quite. I explained this was my first visit. Hoping to hear something, anything. a handout to what a mezza might be, instead I heard. \""I would recommend ordering the Mixed Grill for Two...It has mwah mwah mwah mwah\"" said incredibly fast. I blinked. She said the name of another dish quickly. I blinked. And then -\n\n\""Do you need a few more minutes?\""\nYes. I suppose so. \n\n36 seconds later -\nWe opted to try the Vegetarian Platter (huge) as an appetizer.  Hummus, Babaghanouj, Tabbouleh, (3) Falafel and (3) Vegetarian Dolmades. That's plenty of food to share with four people. Ambitious for two.\n\nWe were granted time to deliberate our entree order a few more minutes. Instead of the Mixed Grill shared plate (which sounded interesting: skewers of Chicken Kebab, Kefta Kebob and Lamb Kebob) Lamb tempted us. Specifically Lamb Shank and Lamb Kebabs. \n\nThe menu is separated into cold and hot mezzas. We made out like bandits quickly picking what we did. The food is stellar here.\n\nAt this point we began an interesting game I'll call \""Moving of the Plates and Glasses\"". We were curious what our entrees might taste like once they were dropped at the table. So we got up and moved them from the far side of the table. You know, within fork reach. Then we slid the appetizer platter out. And the bread plate. And our empty water glasses. And my wine carafe. And the empty beer bottle. (Later I had an even larger collection of glassware.)\n\nWhere did everyone go? That's ok. I was distracted by the Fred Flinstone sized portion of my true to description, falling off the bone, lamb. Honest to god, I almost died. \n\nBut then - oh - my date reached suddenly behind my head with his napkin. His expression frozen with intent. I paused in only what second date behavior in public warranted. \n\n\""Oh? Everything ok?\""\n\""Uh. There was ... a .. bug.\""\n\n(IT WAS RIGHT BY MY HAIR. In the dark.)\nLater I asked my date to describe the bug. It's Arizona. These things happen. He said it could have waved at me. I have little hands. It was bigger than the tip of my thumb. (Also, it apparently got away.)\n\nI recommend stand alone seating.\n\nFOOD\nThe Lamb Shank shocked me in sheer size. When I poked it with my fork gingerly the meat sighed. The grilled vegetables were delightfully seasoned, grilled and layered on top of a wonderful bed of rice. I wish I had grabbed an appropriate photo of the Lamb Shank. This is a dude's platter. Not for a girl on a date! \n\nTHINGS TO KNOW\n+ Service is hit or miss. I finally flagged down a very nice man (possibly a manager) for my 2nd glass of water. \n+ Salsa lessons Fri/Sat night. Lights go off. Disco balls goes on.\n+ Baklava is bone dry and hard. It was difficult to break into bite sized pieces. We returned it. \n+ Turkish coffee is divine!\n+ Time your dinner well before dance class. Service ...changed as dance class preparations began.\n\nDANCE HERE\n+ It's a happening spot. When I left there was a line outside the door and beefy bouncers. Inside spectator watching (almost) made the service level worth it.  \n+ $5 Drink specials!\n+ Friday Night Salsa is produced by AZSalsa.net \""Tumbao | Latin Fridays\"".\n+ Come dressed to impress!"
1,"I have been to Delmonicos for many business dinners and have always found the food, service, and management very solid. On a recent business dinner the food was terrible! We started with crab cakes that were bland. The steakhouse salad was the best thing I ate all night. I ordered the petite filet with a blue cheese crust with the garlic mash. The steak came out looking like a hamburger with cold blue cheese salad dressing pored over the top. The mash came out piped out in an ugly lasagna noodle looking design and were cold and dry. My dinner companion ordered the same thing and got a nice looking filet with a nice blue cheese crust but it had a long piece of shriveled Saran Wrap plastic stuck inside the blue cheese crust. It was restaurant week and maybe the kitchen was over whelmed, but the attention to detail and the trash they served me was unforgivable. I had the key lime pie for dessert which was also forgettable and I didn't enjoy it enough to even finish it. I won't be back for any business meetings or otherwise until they revamp their kitchen staff and management.  Time for a total overhaul Delmonicos."
3,"The 'bou is what it is. It is nothing more. It is nothing less. I've never had food there. But as far as dive bars go its about as dive-y as one can get. It is freakin' tiny so don't bring a huge group of people. You will probably get split up. And you'd be lucky to get a place to sit. \nBut as far as dives go, its perfect. SUPER cheap. Jukebox is one of those electronic ones where you pay a dollar to hear the song you want. But its a great place to have \""that one last drink.\"""
2,Just okay...not impressed by flavored or toppings. Outside tables were covered with spilled yogurt
2,"We stayed the night at the GVR and had a $25 hook up at the Grand Cafe. That's a good thing because there was nothing grand about this place. I take that back. The restaurant is clean, the coffee was bold, and our server was okay. But the food was average, at best. I had a chicken sandwich, bowl of chili, toast w/peanut butter, and a coffee. Their chili was okay and the chicken sandwich was bland as heck. The highlight of my meal was the coffee and peanut butter toast. The good news...$25 of our meal was comped and we were eating again in the next couple of hours. Otherwise, I don't see myself coming back any time soon."
1,"There's not much to say about this Walgreens... it's a drugstore in the North end of town. Not crazy shady, they do have a security guard on staff during operation hours. The drive-thru pharmacy does take a hella-long time though :/"
3,"Dammit, the restaurant is good!  I've had excellent pizzas and pastas there every time I've stayed at the Nug.  But even better is to hang at the bar, and enjoy the Grotto while you get all blotto.  \n\nFull menu is available at the bar, the staff is funny as hell, and occasional wine refills are included."
0,"I had dinner there too night with two local friends. I ordered the grilled chicken plate that came with Mac n cheese and slaw. The chicken breast had bbq sauce on it. I don't think I have ever had Mac n cheese as dry as that. It was horrible. The chicken was rubbery. The slaw ok,. My first mistake was not sending it back but my friends had recommended this restaurant and I didn't want embarrass them. My second mistake was coming to eat here....."
2,"All-you-can-eat sushi for $23.95.  \""Cozy\"" AKA cramped environment inside. Service a bit slow because it was so crowded. \n\nThe No Name roll is the best!!  The Mochi ice cream for dessert is highly recommended and delicious!!"
1,"Dunkin Donuts are terrible. If you got to have your sugar fix, go to Starbucks. Better quality sugar items. \nIn college Dunkin donuts were good because you had a hangover and anything tasted good."
1,Really an average course that was fairly easy. The bummer was no beverage cart when we played Saturday and it was 100. I would not golf here again.
0,"We had a thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza. If I wanted to get a frozen pizza,i would go to the grocery store. The crust was bland, and soggy with a caned sauce. The sausage was little round discs with no flavor. We give this one star because we have to give it a rating."
4,"The staff at the Squirrel Hill branch are incredibly friendly, and the library is always clean and organized."
3,"I've actually never been here for lunch, but hear good things. The breakfast items are good though, for sure."
2,"This is not your regular Vegas hotel.\n\nAs you enter the lobby, it is a combination of check ins/out, bar, dance room, lounge/dining area; it's a multipurpose room. This place does not have an elevator, so be sure when you come here with a load of luggage, ask for the first floor.\n\nThe room itself, is not what you would expect if you were to stay at other hotels in Vegas. It is the same layout as you would see at Super Motel 8 or Motel 6. Although, I do think, a regular Motel would have a fridge, this place doesn't. It doesn't have a tub, so it's not a full bathroom. The room is functional but lack convenience because everything is still manual except for TV & AC.\n\nThis hotel is good for rest only and avoiding the crowds as it does not have casinos & a lot of amenities that other Vegas hotel offers.\nNo self-park; valets only."
2,"I can't complain about the Hotel, especially since it was free for me, but ...\n\nWe had a classic 40\"" Tube TV that stuck out like 4 feet from the wall, the pool is a beacon for the old, hairy, and the kids, and is like a mile from the heart of the strip.\n\nAt least they have a decent convenience store at the first floor and a 24hr gym, pool tables, and ping pong table if you're not headed out."
4,"This place was great!  We had the best time, and the owners were wonderful hosts and knowledgeable guides.  The pool was refreshing and courtyard was relaxing.  The rooms were beautiful, and well decorated and stocked.  The food was wonderful - fresh and delicious.\nWe didn't have a car, everything was within walking distance.  We will definitely be back!"
0,"Please please please, do not waste your time and money dealing with this wicked evil people.\nI called the over a year ago first time just to get more info on their service. I didn't hire them then, but woman ARORA was calling us back every other week. So when the urgency to fix my husband's 3 year old ticket came, I called them back. And same woman was extremely nice and gave me 60$ discount (yeah right!). So their price supposedly came down to $200.\nI asked her if I will have to pay anything else after I pay them $200. She said \""no\"", I only pay $200 and the problem is solved. It was my first time, I was naive and paid my last $200 of my two credit cards. Need to say, original total fir the ticket was $550.\nAfterwards I read bad reviews, I called a week later to see how my case was doing, she was extremely rude and talked to me in a way like \""I just told u!\"" and etc.\nSo later I saw the changes on citation online and the new total was $440!\nThen my husband called and tried calmly to explain her we were not pleased with service, she denied all her previous words of course and hung up.\nI complained with BBB, but obviously they don't care as long as they can catch stupid naive ppl like me and give them $200 for almost nothing.\nNow we ended up spending more than initially which is $440+$200. Do the math."
1,I enjoy their coffee and sandwiches. However the parking lot is the worst! I can never find a parking spot!!!
2,"Cool little locals place which is a breath of fresh air from tourist trap Vegas. Main problems here are dirty bathrooms, too-loud just-out-of-fashion rock music, frat party atmosphere, and over-priced cocktails. The food is plentiful, but a bit bland."
1,"New menu this week- price changes and gone are the great chicken wing specials on Thursdays! I went for lunch, ordered my wings and was surprised by the check...no more wing discounts on Thursdays...of course my bartender failed to mention the changes....she just shrugged and said I'm sorry..."
1,"No comps or upgrade offered, even after I mentioned I was going to play at their property. The room was nice, and clean, but my view was Flamingo ave and not the strip as I excepted.. The front desk people were not very helpful in reducing my rates even after I gambled allot w/the TR card. Downtown seemed to have better deals, and also on food. If you are expecting your expectations to be exceeded this is not the place for you."
4,"If there is one thing I know to be true, it's that the Pizza and sandwiches are simply a thousand times better on the East coast. This is why Cap's deserves the 5 star rating. They bring the good stuff West. \nLiving in Delaware, we were spoiled by many great sandwich shops, and Cap's is an all time Delaware classic. Great sandwiches need great bread, and Cap's delivers. They don't skimp on the meat and veggies, either. Everyone needs to try the Capostrami at least once. The bobby, (thanksgiving on a roll) isn't my thing, but it may well be yours. It's very popular at home, and here in Vegas. \n\nCap's in Vegas takes the exact same approach as back home. It's a no frills, bare bones sandwich shop, East coast style. the menu isn't extensive, but everything is delicious. The best cheese steak in town. \n\nMy personal favorite is the turkey sub. Cap's turkey is almost like pulled or shredded turkey, not sheets of deli turkey. It's juicy and delicious, and I highly reccomend the red pepper spread with it. \n\nLet's face it. While Vegas has lots of amazing food, when it comes to Pizza and sandwiches, the duds are a dime a dozen. Cap's is a diamond in the rough, serving up tried and true sandwiches for a great price. East coast approved. ; )"
2,"Generally a nice hotel with nice amenities, but Vegas standards are high. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathroom is delightful, with a luxurious tub (many photos have been posted). The in-room technology is great, though my AC never cooled the room very well. The staff is abundant and attentive. Best of all, the HVAC systems minimize the smoke in the casinos. \n\nThere are some down sides. First, it seems unremarkable for a newer property on the strip. It is contemporary, but uninteresting. My biggest problem was with the ironing board. They bolted the iron holder to the board, just like a Motel 6 would. Anyone who actually irons will quickly realize that renders half the board useless. Want to iron a shirt, you'll have to iron the back in 3 inch strips. Ironing pants? Plan to move them three times per leg. Pathetic for a hotel that caters to business and upscale travelers."
1,"-Waitress:  An annoying amount of up-selling.  \n-Bread Basket:  Best thing they have going.  Warm and includes pretzels.\n-Salads:  Boxed croutons don't belong at a nice steakhouse.  Either make them fresh or leave them out.  Wedge salad needed more bacon and less carrots.\n-Steaks:  We ordered filets medium rare; came out a solid medium, but still ok.  \n-Sides:  5 spears of asparagus is not \""family style.\""  Creamed spinach was plentiful, but SO salty.   \n-Veggies:  Meh, it's steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  I dipped mine in Bearnaise to make it edible.  Two weird cherry tomatoes also graced our dinner plate.\n\n-Potatoes coming out of kitchen looked really good.  We wished we would have ordered one instead of the spinach.  Oh well.  Bus boy was the star of the show.  Our waitress was pretty absent from the meal and took forever to bring us our check.\n\n-We won't be going back again.  Overall, I can better justify dropping 80 bucks at other places in town, not Fuego."
3,"We made reservations for NYE and we ordered the set menu of 8 courses set by Chef John Chien Lee.\n\nFirst course-Scallop & Caviar Modern Sashimi: Hokkaido Scallp, Petrossian Caviar, Yuzu Foam.\nExcellent! Light, citrus, elegant. It was so good to start off. Wish the serving was bigger by just one more scallop, it was that good.\n\nSecond course-Salmon Tartare: Scottish Salmon, Ginger Miso, Taro Chip\nIncredible! Our favorite of the night, the sauce put it over the top. Probably our favorite of the night.\n\nThird course- Oyster Trio: Kumamoto Oyster, Yama Imo Dashi, Soho Salsa, Ponzu Gelee\nVery good, could taste the different flavors across 3 fresh oysters in a half shell. The house oyster was very tasty.\n\nFourth Course-Ginger Sweetbreads: Crispy Veal Sweetbreads, Sweet Ginger Scallion Sauce, Fuji Apples, Baby Radish\nOne of my favorites, well seasoned. The sauce put it over the top as a winner. The sweetbreads nicely fried, the sauce was so good!\n\nFifth Course-Citrus & Fennel Toothfish: Chilean Seabass, Blood Orange Vinaigrette, Pear Tomato, Mizuna.\nVery good! The fish melts in your mouth, the sauce delicious and the fennel adds a dash of freshness.\n\nSixth Course-Angus 300 Petite Tenderloin: Angus 300 Tenderloin, Fole Fried Rice, Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Soho Steak Sauce\nAlmost perfect! Great piece of beef, excellent sauce, flavorful rice but too much rice, about half the size of the rice would have been perfect. I can see how this might be OK as an entree but for a tasting there was too much rice.\n\nSeventh Course-Cher's Nigiri Sushi: Tai, Kanapachi, Maguro, Aji, Ebi\nGood sushi, the rice was too much after the previous dish. Would have been perfect just as a small serving of sashimi. Still good!\n\nEighth course-Banana cake, Peanut Buter Mousse, Valrhona Chocolate Pearls, Banana Ice Cream, Bacon Chips.\nZING! Such a delicious and well balanced dessert! Moist cake, smooth peanut butter mouses, excellent banana ice cream and perfectly crispy bacon bits. Great way to finish off the tasting menu.\n\nOverall, I'm a big fan, we had a great culinary experience. We'll definitely return here again for some of the chef's special dishes. Nice atmosphere, I think the dance music could have been replaced with something else to create a more elegant atmosphere but there were lots of people just getting rolls and drinks that night on NYE so I guess it fit. The staff is excellent and very helpful."
3,I'm teetering between a 4 and a 5 on this one. I went for the first time yesterday and I was IMPRESSED. The restaurant was cleanly but still had an awesome downhome feeling. The hosts/hostesses and all of the wait staff was accommodating and always made sure to check back in or explain menu items. The menu is full of delicious Southern entrees that make it difficult to choose. I plan to make this a regular spot (but not too often don't want to pack on those extra pounds!) LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
1,"OK Phoenix. I know you don't know what you don't know, but let's set a higher bar with Sushi. Here's my experience. Edamame was over cooked. That's really hard to do, but they did it. My waitress was new but didn't know whether the eel was heated, didn't know whether they had amaebi (which they didn't), and wasn't sure they made a hand roll. And hand rolls weren't even offered as an option in the menu. Hello. \n\nAnd finally, the spider roll was OK, but should have come out warm. \n\nAnd now finally, roll options were limited. Cream cheese should be offered on the Philly roll. They have cream cheese and spicy mayo as an add to all but 2 rolls. That hides bad fish. Come on now."
3,"Ordered the shrimp spring rolls.\nI enjoyed the warm noodles, shrimp seemed old, veggies were a good mix, nothing bitter. Good nonetheless.\n\nOrdered the Bo Luc Lac\nWasn't bad. A bit on the salty side, but rice comes with it so that helps.\n\nNothing better than Orange County yet. \nA good temp replacement."
4,"Awesome.  A little hard to find, just park in strip mall and walk to the barely marked door.  Try it, you won't regret it."
3,"Well I went here for a friends belated Birthday dinner.  We had Salad, a Pizza, a glass of wine, and a chocolate calzone.  \n\nThe Salad was normal, served on a nice big plate with what appears to be homemade dressing.  Wine list is extensive, more so then I thought would be for a pizzeria.  It really is a wine bar and I must say I had the best glass of wine in my life, and I don't really care for wine.\n\nThe pizza was tastie, a little over cooked.  The crust is super thin, which I love but requires a watchful eye when cooked in a brick oven.  However overall the taste was wonderful.  The chocolate calzone was amazing!  Again a little burnt on edges, that is the main reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.  But a must eat for anyone that is a pizza lover!"
2,"Tobacoo shop nestled in the parking lot, this place is pretty easy to overlook.  But once you walk through the doors you'll have no doubt where you are.  Hey, I grew up with my parents who were smokers so I know what it's like to be knocked down and choked out by smoke.  This place is an instant reminder of that feeling.  Someone please get the air circulation fixed so I don't feel like I'm above water scuba diving and holding my breath while I try to pick out a good cigar to smoke.  \n\nOther than that, the staff is super friendly and well educated.  They are very anxious to offer help if you have a question and guide you to a selection that will be just right!"
0,Thank God it was a free meal because I did a survey next door. But I will never come back here the service was so horrible and the waitress was not attentive and it wasn't even busy. I didn't get a refill for my drink and the cup was empty for 20 mins. She got my order wrong. And that's just the top layer. We had to ask for everything twice. Not only that I waited for the bill for 30 mins after getting tired of waiting I asked for it again and she said she gave it to us. If she did I would have paid it and get the heck out.\nThat was just the service the food wasn't great either. Garlic fries were dry its just curly fries with whatever crap on it they call garlic. The pizza blah I've had better at pizza hut. The wings were decent but I can get better ones from the freezer at the grocery store.
0,"I have no idea what happened here, this place went waaaay downhill since it opened. We had friends here from out of town that had been hearing about Smokes for months and were really looking forward to trying it and after we talked it up to them they were looking forward to it even more. Well we went in on Friday night and the place was dead (first time going and not waiting in line which was nice) and the employees seemed impatient, rude and all around miserable.\n\nThe only way I can describe our food is totally disgusting, I wouldn't feed it to me dogs. First of all I worked at a few fast food chains as a teen and I know old oil when I see/smell it and let me tell you that oil hasn't been changed since they opened, I would almost bet my life on it. Our fries were completely brown after being in the oil and totally soggy, disgusting and flavourless. Secondly our poutines barely had a drop of gravy on them, they were totally dry which just added to the nastiness of the fries. Last, the portions were about half the size they were on my first few trips, I know it has been a couple weeks since my last visit but what happened!?! \n\nHonestly, I just wound up feeling embarrassed after telling our friends how good it was. They clearly didn't see what all the hype was about and I don't blame them. I can guarantee I will go back based solely on my previous visits but if this is what it's going to be like from now on I am officially heart broken. Fingers Crossed the pick it back up!!"
2,"I visited Charlotte and went to the Breakfast club with some locals. I was very impressed with the music, being a child of the 80s myself. That part was great. \nPeople watching there was a hoot! I mean, there HAD TO BE a Star Trek convention or a Bill Gates seminar somewhere in the area. I have NEVER seen so many dorks in my life! Maybe the cast of Revenge of the Nerds had a reunion? I'm not sure, but it was super funny! And NONE of them could dance. I laughed my ass off at all of them! I could have sold pocket protectors in the parking lot and made a fortune! \nAs a happily married woman, in no way was I there to meet men, but woe to the girls who are trying to hook up! (Of course, the girls were a bit nerdy, too!) Oh, and the people who were in the least bit trendy and coordinated were gay! So, if NONE of that bothers you, you'll have a blast here!\nThe Breakfast Club's motto ought to be \""Where the ugly go to get laid!\"" LOL! \nI did have a good time there... Dancing to the 80s music was fun. People watching was fun! I would definitely go back!"
1,"Wow, don't really know where to start on this place. We decided to go here based on the previous 5star review plus it was close to our house. Together we ordered the lasagna & chicken parm. Our dinners came w/ side salads. Here's my issues w/ the food. Some of the salad was brown/frozen burnt. I heard A LOT of beeping from the kitchen which makes me believe chef Mike (microwave) was doing the majority of the cooking. My lasagna was extremely over cooked & was mooshy. I did not even want try what my bf got. He said pretty much the same thing about his entree bland and overcooked. The food was warm when it came out. The waitress was nice and friendly. But honestly this place will not make if it continues to run this way."
2,"Auntie Anne's is one of a few eateries in the Excalibur's food court. On the way from Paris to Mandalay Bay, we dropped by here for a pretzel. As far as the snack places in the Excalibur food court, Auntie Ann's might be the least unhealthy (and tasty). \n  I enjoyed the pretzel. It was tasty yet slightly greesy."
2,"Parking is great!  Covered, quick pick up and return.  I use it whenever I fly out of PHX.\n\nHowever, I recently added a detail for my car.  Left the car there 5 days.  Car was not detailed when I returned.  Excuse: they were landscaping.  What garbage.  \n\nParking, yes.  Detailing, nope...will go elsewhere."
4,"I looooovvvvvvee this place.  When you step into the door you might as well loosen your belt a notch or two, it's time to get your grub on.  Here's my list of the GREATS at Chick Box: 1) Fried Chicken; 2)Fried Tillapia; 3)Fried Whiting; 4) Collard Greens; 4)Mac N Cheese.  Wash it all down with a cold lemonade. AAAHhhhhhh!!  Don't forget desert, coconut cake or Sweet Potatoes (Yams).  If you miss mama's home cooking you must try this place."
1,"Two stars for the very high quality ingredients used on sandwiches. Went in with my daughter, she wanted a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles on it. Apparently at jimmy johns pickles are not allowed to touch the bread as I was told they won't put pickles on a sandwich and I just had to buy a side pickle. Seems like a very small step to take for customer service. My daughter spilled her drink on the table and I asked the girl at the counter for a towel. This also seemed to be a monumental task. Overall poor customer service, but still one of the best darn sandwiches I have ever had in my life."
3,"Galaxy Cafe was formerly Saxby's once upon a time.  I was really disappointed when Galaxy took over but they're still really good nonetheless.  I haven't tried any of their brews, just their specialty lattes.  The astro-nut is my ultimate favorite!  It's my go-to beverage every time I'm there.  \n\nThe customer service is always on point.  Really great barista!  I love that this place is so low key.  I come here all the time, there's never a crowd and it's always pretty quiet.  Great place to get work done without any distractions!  My only complaint is that they close really early.  It's always such a hassle when you're on a roll and realize you have to pack up and relocate when the clock strikes 7."
3,"The only thing missing from this buffet is a slightly eccentric candy factory owner donning a top hat and cane with small orange people running around doing his bidding. \n\n Seriously, dessert is the name of the game around here.  Too bad my booze soaked stomach and affinity for salty food led me straight to the Asian counter first, where I stuffed myself full of sushi, fried calamari, chow mein, broccoli beef, Korean bbq, and a myriad of random gourmet offerings I saw on the way back to my table.  I then proceeded to walk towards the omlet station, where something so seductive and indulgent caught my eye that I couldn't look away.  A giant, industrial sized, silver bowl of freshly fried bacon  lay steaming in front of me, and would eventually be my demise.  Of course, I still tried the duck confit ravioli, the prime rib, and the honey goat cheese pizza, but after that bacon I was so stuffed it wasn't the same.  When I finally realized I had enough room for dessert, I meandered over to the desert area where I proceeded to become confused.  Am I still in the buffet, or did I wander into some kind of gelato shop/bakery?  Well, judging by the gentleman carrying away a plate piled the size of a football helmet with dainty little desserts, I'm guessing I'm still in the buffet.  Carrot cake, chocolate lava cake, brownies, cookies, chocolate and lemon mousse shots, donuts, and an entire gelato station are just a few of the desserts offered here.  And what's more, the desserts were actually good!  So my advice to someone going here for the first time-- have dessert first because it's their best offering!  Also, for those of you who do not have a pounding hangover when you roll in here, they offer unlimited mimosas for around $9/ person.  And trust me, they are truly unlimited.  A group of about 15 Texas A&M students at the table next to us had a pyramid of close to 100 empty mimosa glasses stacked in the center of their table. \n\nThis buffet is very good, but at $40/ person it is a bit pricey.   Still, if you like the ambience of the Cosmopolitan and want to eat ridiculous quantities of food that would normally be served on small white plates in stuffy little bistros, this is a cool spot."
3,We were in Vegas again last week and my youngest daughter really wanted to play at  adventuredome for the sand pirate ship alone so we came back and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the place way more places to sit and more attractions. and they added food stands. that I don't remember seeing before. kids had more fun then last time.
2,"Was in town for work and decided to visit this location after work with some coworkers after a little apprehension...I mean c'mon...fresh seafood in Arizona where there isn't any real bodies of water around...  did someone say bubble guts?!? O.x\n\nThe food itself was only food only ...ok....in the sense that nothing special but not horribly done wrong.  We came during the happy hour which was a major +1 for the spot!\n\nThe ceviche and short ribs were decent, ok portion and flavor, not overly fatty cuts of ribs.\n\nThe rolls here are wack...but then again any avid sushiya patron doesn't order \""rolls\"" to begin with. Kinda on the small side and lacked any special flavor and only reason they were order was because the happy hour deal and I needed something to soak up the draaaanks! \n\nOverall the saving grace was the happy hour + hot waitresses working (Thus 4 stars...if not so hot  waitresses feel free to subtract .5-1 stars)\n\noh and for those who happen to give a fuark they honor 4square check ins free edamame or miso soup. another +1"
2,"I have never been to a Capriottis before...\nThis one is brand new and obviously still working out a few kinks. I decided to go with the Cole Turkey. I ordered a medium, which was a mistake. It was HUGE. I ate that sandwich for two days, next time I'm going with the small size for sure. \nI had heard that they cook their turkey fresh and they absolutely do. I took a bite of my sandwich and it was real turkey meat, I even got a small bone in one of the first few bites.\nThe coleslaw is a bit flavorless, but OK. I do not think I would order this sandwich again, but i will be back to try their cheesesteak. \n\nThey deliver within a two mile radius...\n\nIt's A-OK."
2,"Had won a raffle for a pair of tickets to the Sgt. Pepper Live featuring Cheap Trick at the theater in Paris Las Vegas.  I went with a friend from school and we were seated in row A seat 73-74.\n\nThis is my first time watching a famous band performed, and it brought tears to my eyes, literally. It wasn't the songs or the performance, but the stage lights that shot painful beams of bright white light into the crowd during the first couple of songs. My eyes were hurting so much that it teared up and to the people sitting next to me, it must have looked like I was moved to tears by the songs.  Unfortunately that set such a negative tone for the rest of the performance, that I think I would have enjoyed it more had I just closed my eyes and just listened to it. The lighting is not the band's fault, but the person responsible for orchestrating the the stage lights to set the mood and enhances the performance, and that was -5 stars for me.  \n\nAnyway, the performance of the band and the singers were good.  The highlight for me was the Sgt. Pepper Orchestra and the Indian Ensemble.  I love the music performed by skilled musicians with instruments, especially the string instruments like the violin.\n\nThis show is highly recommended for Cheap Trick fans and fans of Beatles music.  From looking at the audience in attendance, the avg age is up there, but they were really into it.\n\nAdvice: if you are staying at a different casino or hotel, make sure to budget plenty of time for the cab ride to Paris, because Las Vegas Blvd is always grid locked during that time of the evening.\n\nPerformance: 3.5 stars for me overall and 5 stars for the orchestra and the Indian Ensemble\nSeats: 2 stars, because it is not comfortable and it is not roomy either. Think flying coach on a budget airline and the seats are locked in the upright position.\nLighting: -5 stars"
2,"Highlights/lowlights\n\n1) large breakfast menu\n2) fast service\n3) not something to go out of your way for but a convenient breakfast spot if you are staying at the Paris Hotel\n\nI am torn between 3 and 4 stars here. I don't think le cafe is meant to be a breakfast \""destination\"" more so something that is quick and easy if you are staying at the Paris hotel. I ate here at 8am on a Saturday and was seated with my co-worker right away (inside seating). We were asked if we wanted coffee/OJ right away and it arrived promptly. Our server came over shortly after and while not super friendly, was able to set me up with some scrambled egg whites and fruit (not on their normal menu). My co-worker got a waffle that looked (and supposedly tasted) delicious! Overall, probably not somewhere you should go out of your way for but a pretty good breakfast spot if you are staying close by."
0,Customer Service over the phone was very excellent. BUUUUTTTTTTTTT i waited an hour and still didnt get my food I ordered at 7:15 and they didnt arrive till 9:02 I was very upset i turned them away I wasn't hungry anymore...
0,Denied service because our party of 7 is too big?! They can't sit parties larger than 4. Happy to take my service else where.
1,"Ok, this is going to be long because I stayed here for 4 nights for business. This was the location of a conference and the recommended location for lodging. I can't complain too much since my company paid for lodging, food, and travel but I've stayed in MUCH better places in Vegas...\n\nI checked in at 9pm and there was only 1 person behind the counter. they could have used a 2nd person (there were about 3 people in line). I was quickly checked in to a room on the 18th floor of the north tower (view of a parking lot). The room was better than expected. Everything seemed clean and the loveseat was perfect to curl up on to do some reading.\n\nHere is some info regarding my stay-\n\nSmoke- I asked for a non-smoking room, but the entire property stinks. I think the ventilation system needs to be renewed.\n\nAir- Just because it's 106 outside doesn't mean they have to compensate by making it 46 inside. The AC was POWERFUL.\n\nFood- Sidewalk Cafe- service SUCKED. Food was ok.\nRoom Service- I had breakfast 2x in my room. Food arrived quickly, was hot, and the portions were very nice. However, they don't pick the trays up and there was food left for almost 24 hours in the hallway...eck.\nIt's a hotel in Vegas, the food is expensive.\n\nCustomer Service- very poor. The employees did not look happy to be there. No one was smiling, no one wished you a good day as you walked by. They just didn't care, and they even didn't care who knew that they didn't care!\n\nPool- GROSS! I went out at 5pm to sit in a lounge chair, have a cocktail, and read a book...the bar closed at 5 (but the pool was open until 8- that makes no sense), the chairs were not comfortable and looked really dirty, and there were stupid kids splashing in the pool."
1,"Dr Whipple is a really good doctor, but unless you're retired and have all day to go to appointments, you might want to find another doctor.  You will never wait less than 1.5 hours, and the staff is less than friendly."
2,"The food was great.   It does not look like your typical Thai Restaurant but the food was delicious.  The one  thing I will suggest to the owner though, don't charge for Prik Nam Plah. That's like charging for tap water.  The waiter/bartender made my nam plah and when I ran out I asked for another and he said to me, \""I would have to charge you again.\""  Huh?  I would rate this probably a 4 start if it weren't for that.  Thai restaurants do not charge for Prik Nam Plah.  That is a typical thing on the tables of Thai Restaurants."
2,"We attend this show 3/11.  My wife is a huge Elvis fan, and we have both been to Graceland.  The show had its good and bad parts.  I would say this isn't a TRUE Cirque du Soleil show.  There was one act that featured the Cirque but most of the rest of the show was like a musical.  There was a Super Hero act that was pretty cool.  I thought the Plastic/Rubber Elvis hair on the actors in the final scene was cheesy.  Overall I can't say that my wife or myself would recommend anyone to check out the show.  \n\nThe Aria is a HUGE hotel complex, so give yourself time to get to the show and find your seats.  The show wasn't sold out, so, I would assume they would have tickets available last minute."
2,"Stayed at Vdara for one night on a quickie trip to vegas. Booked same day through hotwire.com and got it for like 115 or something- it was a Monday night. \n\nPros-\nBRAND NEW\nNON SMOKING\nNO CASINO\nSMELLS AMAZING throughout hotel \nFREE VALET\nVERY CHIC DECOR IN ROOM/LOBBY\n2 GIANT FLAT SCREENS IN ROOM\nGREAT PRICES\n\nCons-\nRIDICULOUS TIME TO CHECK IN/OUT (45 min) \nLEFT A NOTE FOR MANAGER TO CALL- NO RESPONSE\nHORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE  \nNO CLOSE LATE NIGHT DINING BESIDES ROOM SERVICE\nREALLY CONFUSING TO FIND... \n\nYou have to go as if you are going to Aria and then go across Harmon to get there... took us like 20min to find even using GPS... taking Vdara drive off of Harmon takes you to the employee part ... very counterintuitive... \n\nLots of quirks to be worked out but for the price I would stay again since I like the location, non smoking, views, and laid back atmosphere... I think by the next time I go to vegas they will have their ish figured out...and if not- I'll let you guys know! :)"
3,This was a first class dining experience. Initial greeting was not overly friendly but efficient and what you might expect at a top restaurant.\n\nWine list was comprehensive with plenty of reasonable choices for those not looking to mortgage their house for a bottle of wine. Cakebread and Cymus Canernets were around $180.\n\nWe started with a veal stuffed ravioli that was incredible! I could have made meal out of them alone. For the main course took the lobster pot pie. It was also outstanding though not what I was expecting it to look like. It's very rich so be forewarned. \n\nGot the Chocolate Sampler ( little small) and root beer float for dessert. Both good choices if in fact you still have room. \n\nThis is a great place if you are in Vegas and like fine dining!

1,"If it was not for the fact I felt I was scammed out of something I did not ask for this place would have gotten a four star rating. I inquired about the price for a French manicure and was quoted $17 over the phone. I was very happy with my whole experience until I went to pay, and was told it was $35. I said but you quoted me $17 on the phone. I was told that was for a regular French manicure, I gave you gel.\"" I explained to her I do not even know what gel is. She said it would last longer than a regular manicure, which is great, but would have appreciated being told my options up front. I will say my nails looked great, but I have never felt this ripped off in my life. I asked the price up front so  I wouldn't feel jaded, it should have been my choice to have gotten gel, not what they thought would be better."
4,Went in for brake pads and was helped by Hector T. So helpful gave me some great tips yhat saved a ton of time. Also brakes had lifetime warranty so tjey were FREE!
2,"Amazing hotel, terrible service!  That just about sums it all up.\n\n- Couple of great lounge / bar areas.  Chandelier lounge was pretty sweet\n- Rooms are nicely furnished.  I'd make sure you're not staying in the same room as someone you don't know really well as you can see straight into the shower from the main room area\n- Bamboo pool was great\n- Gym area was really big BUT cost $15!!  Maybe this is the norm for Vegas, I don't know, but the last thing I need is any extra excuse not to workout and $15 / day to hit the weights definitely isn't helping\n\n- Service was SHITTY! Yes, so shitty that it gets all capital letters.  For starters when we checked in, there was only a line of like 3 people in front of us and it took 30 minutes - no joke.  Then when I finally did check in, the girl told me I was in a double queen room with a view of city center.  My response \""Oh really, because my reservation here says I should be in a King with a view of the Bellagio fountains\""  to which she got all offended and pulled the whole \""well let me see what's in the system here\"".  550 key strokes on her screen and 15 minutes later, still nothing from her.  I finally got so annoyed that I said \""just give me the freaking room you put me in so I can start drinking already\"""

4,"Juanita and Larry saved us! When the garage repair person from Dreikosen never showed up or called, I contacted Upright. Juanita came to the rescue and was able to squeeze me in when they had a customer reschedule...lucky for me! Our garage spring broke last night and we couldn't open the garage door.\nLarry, the owner came when they said he would and had the best attitude. He immediately went to work and got the job done. He and his associate Chad were kind enough to also relocate our garage door button so we wouldn't have to reach behind the fridge anymore. They were fast, friendly and priced very well (compared to others in town)...and they won't upsell you on things you don't need. They have been in business for over 20 years and I would gladly recommend them to all my friends, family and clients."
1,"So my husband and I went on a date night, and my friend said we had to try Guy's restaurant so we decided we would. There was no wait when we got there on a Saturday night around 9:30pm. It was a cool setting. I liked the decorations and the menus, however it was a bit cramped. The waiter was friendly and took our drink order, we like to order appetizers, but the selection was very limited so we just decided to order our dinners. We both ordered the Mac-n-cheese burger which also comes with fries. It took about 20-30 minutes for our food to come so it wasn't too long of a wait. I was super excited to try this burger, recommended by the hostess. I was not impressed. The burger was a good size but for being a Mac-n-cheese burger you could hardly taste any cheese. I was a little disappointed. It was cool they the burger came with a side of 4 different types of fries, however they were COATED with seasoning making them really hard to eat. All I tasted when I ate them was the chili pepper salt mix that was covering them. I love food network and Guy's show, but I was sadly disappointed with the quality of the food. I thought for $20 I would get a little better burger than it was. Most likely won't go back, which I'm sad about because I was so excited to try it."
1,"From the menu they have on their website, this place looked pretty promising. However, it turned out to be a disappointment.\n\nWe shared the Crab Wontons appetizer to start. The sauce that accompanied the wontons was gross and bland. The wontons themselves were also not good... The crispy part of them was really not that crispy, it was tough and seemed old/spoiled. Also, there was no crab meat in them like the menu had indicated. It was pretty much just like dipping cream cheese in weird sauce.\n\nMy bf ordered the \""Authentic Traditional Pad Thai\"" which is a different dish than the \""Pad Thai\"" at this restaurant. When my boyfriend was ordering, he asked our waiter to explain the difference between the two before he made a decision. The server said that the \""Authentic Traditional Pad Thai\"" was very similar to other Pad Thai dishes you would get at other Thai restaurants, whereas the \""Pad Thai\"" was more of an \""Americanized\"" version that had sweet and sour sauce? My boyfriend and I LOVE Thai restaurants and we've been to a lot so he ordered the \""Authentic Traditional\"" version, thinking it would be like the ones we've ordered in the past. It was not. It came out and was soaking in sauce, very unlike every other Pad Thai dish we've ever ordered. We both tried it and it was clear they used half a bottle of fish sauce on the noodles which baffles me because Pad Thai never tastes fishy and it's never bathing in sauce? My boyfriend just ate it anyway and said he wouldn't have liked the other \""Pad Thai\"" dish anyway because pad thai isn't usually made with sweet and sour sauce either... So we're both just confused with their pad thai dishes and the sauces they make them with.\n\nI got the Drunken Noodles entree and it was good. They ask you how spicy you'd like your food from level 1 to level 5. I ordered mine at level 4 and it was just a tad too spicy but that is not the restaurant's fault, I should have played it safe with a level 2 or 3. No complaints about my entree other than I needed a couple water refills to cool my mouth down.\n\nOverall, not the greatest experience. 2 out of 3 of the food items we ordered were severely lacking in quality and taste. I gave it 2 stars though because the service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our food at all. However, that could just be because there was only one other group in the entire restuarant. Probably wouldn't go back. Also, my boyfriend was really sick the next morning after we ate there. I think he threw up 5 times at least, so I'm not sure if he had a mild case of food poisoning from this place or what. \n\nIf you want A+ Thai food, go to Mint Thai Cafe on Gilbert Rd. in between Guadalupe and Baseline. Been there a million times and the food is awesome."
0,"Service... OMG. Find the owner... Slap some sense in them. I cannot believe how oblivious some people are that let's them think they have the right to be an owner. We seriously asked for water... 3 times! Our food was delivered and there was no silverware. We asked for silverware... 3 times! All while our quirky little waitress chatted it up with the bartender. \n\nIf you have but one day to live because the world is ending, and Desert Babe's is the last place to get food on the planet, shoot yourself in the head and save yourself true misery."
0,"Managers were rude to our group. Overpriced drinks and food, misleading pricing, Bill was predictively wrong and overcharged. Won't be back."
0,"I've been coming here for about 3years. During the World Series of poker there are few restaurants to eat at in the Rio. My first few times coming here (3years ago) I had an amazing experience the food and service were 5star and it was one of the things I looked forward to while staying at the dingy Rio Hotel. Anyways I ate there 2x in July. The first time just my boyfriend and I dined there and after our meal our stomachs went hay wire for 2days! We got so sick! Then we went back with another couple. Because we werent 100% sure that it was Martoranos that made us sick, but low and behold after the 4 of us went to dinner EVERYONE had horrible issues with their digestive system. I dont know if the food was spoiled or if they just over did it on the grease but we never plan on returning there. It tasted great but the after affects were not worth it. It almost makes me loose my appetite when I think about what exactly they are doing in their kitchen that made everyone so sick."
1,"Be forewarned.\nThis restaurant has a new device at the table that allows you to play games, reorder drinks and pay your bill. However it has teaser ads for the games and if you press the screen at all it will charge you to play.\nThere are a ton of bars in the area (Native New Yorker, etc.) that allow the trivia play for free. Nice try Chili's but I will never touch that thing again."
1,Extremely inconsistent to say the least.\nIve had decent food from there and also terrible food from here.\nIts pretty inexpensive but definitely not worth the chance.
1,"We ate at Social House when it was at a Treasure Island and thought it was great. We tried it today and it was very disappointing.  We had short ribs (cold and too oily), various rolls (not bad but nothing special), chicken teriyaki (texture was odd almost as if it was baked and not like most chicken), we had several other dishes and our bill came out for five people to $350. We were all unsatisfied with the food.  Wouldn't recommend this place at all."
4,"Seriously laughed my head off the entire way through and completely understand why people see this show over and over again. When it was over and I was walking out, I wanted to experience it all over again.\n\nBear and I commented and laughed about him throughout the entire trip. \n\nThe only downside about the show was his opening act-- not funny, very underwhelming. But whatever, 15 min of that was worth it. Maybe that was the point, because CT came out with a BANG and kept the energy that high or higher throughout the entirety of the show. The night we saw him, the Luxor president & family (celebrating a birthday) were in the audience and he seemed to be keeping it as boss-friendly as possible... I would love to see one of his uncensored shows!"
2,Ate here for a corporate event and had a limited menu to choose from.  From what I can tell the food was good however the location is challenging to get to.
0,"I ordered a Holstein's Lager hoping to get a good beer I can't find everywhere. Beer came and it was completely flat and totally skunked. I told the waiter and he instantly replaced with a good beer. As he was doing that, he told me it was really just PBR. Selling old, flat PBR as a house beer? Don't bother coming here for anything original"
2,"this place has been here for years and though I've lived in Phoenix all of my life I just started eating here about a year ago. I was kind of leery about trying it out. It's not in the best neighborhood and I figured the seafood couldn't be all that good considering this is the desert. \n\nKnock Kneed is a hole in the wall, but it's a great little hole in the wall. I usually get the shrimp platter with a side of fried okra and hush puppies. \nIf you like hush puppies this place has the best! I often just want to go there simply for the hush puppies. \n\nI got my coworkers hooked on this place and we usually get lunch from KKL once a week and we don't work close to this place either. It's usually a 30 minute trip there and back, but worth it."
2,"Pros: The food is really good. We got the Pad Thai and the Thai Elephant Fried Rice both with chicken and #3 on the spicy scale. The d\u00e9cor is nice and clean. Also the lunch special price is REALLY great, 2 meals plus Thai ice tea for $22 is a great deal.\n\nCons: We sat our selves and we were served soup and water immediately but it took them awhile to take our order. Then my boyfriend got his food a good 15 minutes before I got mine. That really pisses me off when one person gets their food first. We should be served at the same time so we can eat together. It sucks when one person is finished before the other and they have to wait for the other person to eat."
2,"Went back for my second try.   Better this time, but not great!  The workers are all very nice!\n\nAgain, I got takeout. Brisket was ALL fat and inedible!!  Beef rib was small, but thick; had good flavor, but the top was too charred and crusty.\n\nThe pulled pork and dark-meat chicken was wonderful!  I don't usually order hushpuppies, because I think they're dull. I heard there's had a \""kick\""-I wasn't disappointed with that!\n\nThe sauce was fabulous!  It is very spicy, which I like.  If you don't like the heat...stay out of this kitchen!  I think they must give the questionable stuff to takeout customers so they don't have to hear you complain.\n\nNot sure I'll go back."
3,"Fast delivery. Told me it's going to take about an hour and the delivery came 30 minutes right after I hang up the phone.  Great serving amount of food. Friendly, fast, and reasonable cost. One of the few I'll recommend..."
2,"I'm used to going into a Sally's and being able to ask the people there for advice on color and get answers, I mean isn't that why they require you to have experience with this sort of thing in order to work there? No one came up to ask me or my sister if we needed help, although they went up and asked everyone else. Both employees were mostly chatting amongst each other and talking about closing the bars to the store earlier so people would get the hint. huh? I get working retail blows chunks but you shouldn't bitch about the customers in front of the customers. Either way, I won't be back to this location anytime soon."
0,A friend of mine went to this place last weekend ans asked me to write this review.\nThey were a group of 47 people and the service as well as the food were really bad and over priced for what was offered e.g. her cousin wasn't hungry and only ate a piece of bread and a glass of water for what she was charged $4.00!!!  \nWhere my friend was sitting there was a nail that made a small cut on the back  of her. \nIn sum she's advising everyone to avoid this place...
4,I am thankful I found this very honest Animal Hospital....I've found another closer that was awful..me and and my best friend..and also my wallet are much happier now....we are all happy and HEALTHY and HAVE MUCH MORE MONEY NOW\n\nApollo  don't sell me treatments and wrong medications that  my friend and I don't need unlike the other place.....\n\nThis place IS HONEST.......me and my BEST friend are Thankful\n\n11-8-14\nAS AN UPDATE\n\nThings have changed since my review.\n\nI don't have a reason to lower the rating so I didn't yet.\nMost of the staff including DR. has changed.\n I will update if needed.
4,"Wow, I think this actually beats Lotus of Siam. Really.\n\nPROS:\n\n- everything the server recommended was delicious\n- theres a salad with apple that is a MUST\n\nCONS:\n\n- none\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis is hands down the most authentic and delicious Thai food I've ever had. You have to check this place out if you're in Vegas."
4,"We go here every friday!!! Great food! Great drinks and hot staff!\n\nThis place is a party every time we go to eat.  Any plain outting becomes one of the funnest nights of the week.  \n\nThe sushi is amazing!  The rolls are amazingly, creative and refreshing to have something beyond the ordinary.  Even better when you get the bill and it is half of what you expected."
2,"Went to this HD for the first time today.  I've always seen it from 485 driving by, but never really stopped since I usually go to the one in Matthews.\n\nThis HD is unique since there are 2 entrances - one in the shopping center and then the regular \""entrance\"" around the back.  It's kinda cool actually since the shopping center entrance make the big box store look like a regular store in a strip mall but then the actual store is hidden behind the other store fronts in the Promenade.\n\nStaff was friendly and helped me find what I was looking for today."
1,Put reservations in early for Valentines Day . Requested Window seat.  Reservations were at 5pm. Got there at 4:30. Was seated pretty quick..maybe 3 minute wait. However got seating next to the column that was actually nexr to the window so that waa disappointing. Bread basket was great. We ordered rack of lamb and rib eye and twice baked potato. Baked potato was amazing. But both of our main dishes werent good. Neither of us liked the food and it literally took an hour an a half to get our food. Wont be going here ever again. View was amazing and staff waa nice. Even got a rose with the check.
0,"We decided to give this place a try for breakfast today, wow what a disappointment.  \nI ordered the blue sunrise (2 eggs, turkey sausage, rosemary hash browns and sour dough toast) and my wife ordered the artisan breakfast sandwich.  \n\nWhen the order came out my potatoes were cold, the sour dough toast was cold and hard as a brick and my wife's \""sandwich\"" incorrectly came out as a wrap.\n \nWe sent both back.  On the second try the sandwich was ok but my sourdough toast, although warm this time, was too hard to cut and the potatoes, although warm, still were looking for a sign that they made it to a hot pan. Kind of a beige color. \n\nI asked for jelly or jam for my toast, received a tub of marmalade- not my favorite.\n\nThe \""side of fresh fruit\""  that came with both breakfasts consisted of a couple of blueberries, a few slices of strawberries and slices of apple so sour we did not eat them.\n\nWe both had black coffee, which was very good and came in a large cup.\n\nNot a fan of walking in and ordering at the front before sitting down, either.\n\nThe signage on the building says Pure Clean Food with a Twist.... not today."
1,"Went here to check it out since my coworker was singing Barro's praises. Welp, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. The crust (the most important part of a pizza) is weird and kinda spongy, but otherwise comparable to any other run-of-the-mill pizza joint.\n\n I got the Kona, which is some kind of play on a Hawaiian pizza except it has chicken instead of ham and some kind of sweet teriyaki glaze instead of red sauce. Not very good, and if I had it to do again I'd just get a traditional pizza. Still, don't think it's really worth it without a coupon or something.\n\nThe staff was nice and the atmosphere if you're dining in (I didn't) seems above average for this type of place."
3,"I walked into Bond on a Friday around noon and was immediately greeted by Shawna  and introduced to my nail tech, Dominica. \nDominica took her time on my gel mani and made sure to attend to my cuticles and make sure the gel color was on perfectly and and even.\nTotally worth every penny and I will be back!"
1,Food is so so..Breakfast specials are cheap but I'd like more than one piece of french toast than just the lonely one on my plate...it's only bread.. our sausage patties were gross..my eggs were cold but hashbrowns were hot? Alexi's on 19th ave and Union Hills is breakfast done proper..old school..I will say that the staff at Times Square were nice and attentive but We're not goin back
2,"To begin with, this is not Schwartz's. I had a so-so large chicken soup with the works. It was supposed to have kreplach, matzo balls, and something else. I guess they also forgot the something else.\n\nMy friend and I had been visiting our old haunts and taking pictures of each other in the lobby of the high we had graduated from in 1964. As we talked we harked back to Smoked Meat. We were not up to driving downtown, so we opted for this location, instead of the aforementioned Schwartz'.\n\nMy friend had the large smoked meat lean while I had the smoked meat platter Medium Fat. People don't order smoked meat lean! It can be dry and has nothing to do with execution, its just that!\n\nUnlike Heather the fries were piping hot, the coleslaw tasty, and the service non-pareil. The service alone almost pushed this up to a 4 Star.\n\nIf you have time go to Schwartz's or to Smoke Meat Pete's in Vaudreuil, but if you are in that area of the city and you need your fix, this will do well."
4,"Solid lunch spot for the uptown crowd.  Gets a 5 star from me because it's a GREAT option if you're eating paleo or primal.  Meat tasted yummy, tons of selection in the salad bar (try the tiny shrimp salad, it won't disappoint!).  Not your usual iceburg lettuce and ranch dressing salad bar.  A bit pricey for lunch, but you get more than what you pay for.  Try to go right when they open to get the freshest stuff and avoid the crowds (11:15-11:30 is a perfect time).  MEAT IS AWESOME.  That is all, thank you."
3,"Came back here 2 more times, this time I stuck with the lunch pricing vs dinner pricing during lunch time. Food is still fresh. Depending on who the server is that day will depend on how great of a customer service you are going to get. \n\nThey get pretty packed during noon time and there seems to only be 2 people working there so expect to take a longer lunch. \n\nI finally tried their desert (808 special and malassada sundae) and its pretty tasty. I like the malassada sundae a lot because of the flavors in it. \n\nDefinitely would like to go back and eat more."
3,"If you're not looking for extreme peace, quiet, & time to yourself, then this is for you. If not, then you had a poor choice. The palms place is wonderful for parties, especially with all their different, fancy, cozy rooms & suites. I got a suite & it had a wrap around balcony. What makes it even more worth it, is the pricing. It's not over-priced. Just don't break or mess ip anything because you won't get your deposit back. The security is strict. You need a room key to go up. Better than your typical suite. The site is user-friendly & service is not bad. \n\nHowever! They need to keep up with bits of maintenance. Such as light bulbs, & dusting. Rooms should be crystal clear. Other than that, it's a 4-5 star resort just off the strip, so traffic isn't horrible."
1,"Not a fan !!! Just another company with a fancy slogan and web page !! If u have little projects it's kind of a waste of their time , is exactaly how they made me feel ! We will see if they pay attention enough to get the job done right ....."
4,"BEST SANDWICHES EVER!  My first time experience included ordering the Veggie, and it was amazing!  The bread is like an English muffin toasted to perfection!  The feta cheese inside really makes this sandwich!\nOne would think that a sandwich that includes no meat would be ordinary and bland.  This is far from the opposite with the Veggie.  I came back the next day because all I could think about was my sandwich.  I decided to try the Caprese the second time.  Compared to the Veggie, the Caprese had a light, mildly sweet taste.  It oozed with gooey mozzarella goodness.\n\nI'm now back in California, and cannot stop thinking about Earl of Sandwich. I am really contemplating about driving all the way to Vegas just so I can satiate my craving. \n\nC'mon, Earl of Sandwich!  Y'all need to set up a SoCal location!!!"
4,this food will blow your mind out!!! THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD ever made by italians in LV. We come here to indulge ourselves and wish we could swim in their marinara sauce.  I want to bath in the sauce!
0,"You get what you pay for....I went to Las Vegas to attend a industry trade show so I stayed there because it seemed like a good deal price wise. I did the the tweet and posting thing because of the promise of a room upgrade and Vegas Strip views...I got neither.  We had to wait in line for an hour to check in, waited 20 minutes in line at the Banana Leaf Cafe the next day for breakfast because they were understaffed - when we complained to a manager he told us the staff was doing double-duty. The room we were given was musty smelling and the mold in the AC unit ended up giving me headaches and a sinus infection.  The pillows on the bed were old and worn flat, the shower was a joke. I was told a room change was not possible because they were sold-out. I will never stay there again."
0,"Shasta built my pool in 2006 with a raised spa.  The spa now leaks due to an internal Pipe leaking.  Contacted Shasta and they said it was not covered by their warranty, it only covers structural issues.  Shasta warranty is not that good, dont believe the hype about being a Shaster master pool.... all these pool builders use the same contractors and Shasta doesn't give any better support/warranty then the cheaper guys do."
0,"We are usually HUGE fans of ethnic marketplaces and food courts wherever we travel, but a word of caution here is needed.  My partner became violently ill after the combo plate here yesterday.  He had the birria and the red chili with beef and potatoes.  I had the  carnitas plate and was fine.  If the food looks like its been on the line too long, it probably has been."
0,"Drove through this one today determined to try one of the thick yellow Lemonade's I always see advertised. I ordered a large and drove up to the window. What I got was a solid white concoction and very watery. I took a sip and not only was it barely cool in temperature, but tasted like a solid block of sugar. No lemon to be found anywhere, and certainly not the thick cold looking drink advertised.  I knocked on the drive thru window repeatedly as the girl who waited on me had closed it, for what seemed like an eternity. When she finally came to the window with a disdainful look on her face asking what I wanted.  I explained the issue and not only did she not offer to remake it, she seemed pissed that I had a beef. When I suggested an Orange Julius instead or something comparable, she only pointed out the higher price difference. I then asked for a large diet soda, which she obliged but didn't bother to refund the difference in price. (I should have got back at least .40 cents) Clearly the advertised product and what you will find waiting for you at the window are two different things. I guess what made me the most dissatisfied is her complete lack of interest in giving me what I paid for, and essentially a \""what do you want me to do about it\"" attitude. Does this place even have a manager? I wonder. Clearly customer service is not something they strive for here. And management if you're reading this, here's a tip; If you're going to advertise a THICK, COLD, LEMON drink, you need to deliver. What was handed to me today was pathetic, not to mention the crappy customer service. I won't be back."
3,"I've\""ve been somewhat dissatisfied with the old Monta at spring mountain/Decatur due to its inconsistent quality as well as recent health inspection issues, so I was looking forward to seeing how the new place on the other side of town would be like.\n\nI heard that it was next to Japan Creek, but as I drove by, I did not see any signs anywhere, but I was surprised to find out that the restaurant was virtually full of customers.  How did they find out?  It was nice to see that the new place is about the twice the size of the old place.\n\nThe menu was virtually identical, but with additional \""chaya\"" offerings such as chicken karaage, daikon salad, hakusai salad and such.  \n\nI tried chicken karaage, which was very well done, hot, juicy and tasty.  I liked the daikon salad as I love anything daikon, but it reminded me more of daikon sunomono, and was slightly heavy on vinegar taste as I was expecting more of a sweet sesame dressing kind of thing, but I still liked it.  \n\nI also had fried rice, but this was mediocre at best.  It was way too oily IMO.  Well done fried rice should be dry and not wet, as a huge firepower from the grill should burn off the oil as you swing the rice into the air as you mix it in a wok.  I think the chef doesn't have the fried rice cooking mastered yet.  As a matter of fact, quite a bit far from it.  \n\nI had tonkotsu ramen and it was virtually identical to that of old Monta.  Not too fatty, but cloudy white tonkotsu broth was better done than the old Monta plagued by inconsistencies in recent months.    \n\nI like this place.  I just wish they've opened it in Summerlin instead of Henderson."
0,"Stay away even if you have a groupon! Worst company I've ever dealt with! I had a Groupon for $20 worth of groceries plus a fresh produce box. After they delivered they had charged me for my entire order as if they forgot my special deal and I had to wait two weeks for that refund to later find out they were still charging me $16 just for delivering it to my house although online it said the charge would only be $6! Thanks for those hidden fees Winder Farms. And now a month later after I cancelled my account due to unsatisfied customer service, they have randomly charged me $30 for who the hell knows?! And I probably won't receive that refund for another two weeks, how lovely is that! I am not happy because of Winder Farms and refuse to ever use their services again."
4,"For local DYI auto projects, big and small, this is my place. Staff are so helpful and knowledgeable. No need to go anywhere else."
4,"The doctors here are awesome!\n\nI found out I have a stress fracture in my second metatarsal in my left foot.  Being a runner, I not only need my feet but need a doc that understands what I am going through.  Dr. Wyant made me feel at ease and comfortable talking about any issue that I needed to about my concerns with returning to running afterwards.\n\nI had my first cast put on by Stan, and wow...this walking cast was almost like not having a cast in the first place!  After three weeks, they took the cast off to x-ray and still fractured...so Stan put on the second cast, too.  Now...I didn't know this the first time, but Stan does ultrasounds at EVFA...so he casted me as a favor!\n\nThanks, Dr. Wyant and Stan for making an unpleasant injury as pleasant as you both could!"
4,"I am from Florida and we have Yogurtology down there, which is amazing. I have tried every frozen yogurt place that I have come across in order to find something that compares to that. Oh! Yogurt has exceeded my expectations.\n\nThey are the first place I found since my Florida place to have everything I want. The BEST tart yogurt in this area!!!\n\nOnly 41 cents per ounce. I got the same amount of froyo I would get in Florida for half the price. There is plenty of seating inside and it's beautiful decor.\n\nI will be going back often. Please try it."
1,"I traveled to Las Vegas to interview with an airline.   I had to pay full fare  even though I was flying on my possible new employer.  A two day interview that required that I pay for my own accommodations.  I placed a bid on Priceline for an economical hotel.  I was booked here from the 17th to the 19th of February.  \""The Strip\"" is four miles away  .  \n\nThe exterior of this hotel is nothing to look at, perhaps borderline tacky.   I can go into detail, however, nothing artistic, beautiful, classy or stylish.   It could very well be military barracks.  \n  \nThe lobby is pretty generic - rural Motel 6, plain Jane, don't close the curtain while you are in the shower type of place.   The check-in process took about two minutes and no frills.\n\nMy room was on the first floor.  I made two left turns and 50 meters down the hallway, it seemed I was inside a crack-house in the Bronx, just with newer paint, no graffiti, and absent prostitutes smoking cigarettes by their doors.   Inside my \""suite\"" is a clean space containing a Home Depot GE refrigerator, two electric burners, a stainless steel sink, tacky plastic two-cup coffee maker, plenty of counter space, one queen size bed with five pillows, ironing board, broken Hamilton Beach iron, clean spacious bathroom and my biggest disappointment - a cathode ray tube Zenith Concierge television that I never turned on.  \n\nBesides the television, the next biggest problem with the hotel is the thickness of both the walls and suite's door.   I was on my phone and I could hear clearly one adjacent neighbor exhaling with anticipation for the end of my call.    How long can a neighbor's phone conversation echo across three suites ?   My other wall-neighbor was a double and possibly a triple occupancy.   They most probably are banking on the Las Vegas ad term, \""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\""  Of course, unless nine months later there is a need for a bigger home.  \n\nThe front door - Mary !  Mother of God !   You could hear a pimp flipping through his cash 50 meters away.   The door looks sturdy, but it does not filter any hallway sounds.   Its like having a beaded curtain for a sound barrier.  \n\nIf you bring your computer, the front desk will give you the password to use their free server.   If you decide to relax in your room with headsets on and watch a movie on Hulu, then you are in for a Buddhist Monk test of patience.  A 45 minute episode of Revenge can take 3 hours to complete because of the buffering.   Lastly,  to keep this review short - don't slide open the curtain of your window facing the parking lot - just don't do it.  \n\nIf you made it this far, then you deserve to know.  Every single employee has been courteous, genuinely interested in helping.   Housekeeping was courteous and accommodating.    \n\nOn my last day, I received a call from the front desk.   The front desk clerk called to ask me if I was going to use my (suite's) phone?  The Hotel is going to do a phone upgrade and phones will go offline.  No, problem, I have a cell phone.   I immediately placed a wake-up call and explained I was going to the airport.   A free shuttle from the hotel front door at my 5:30 am check out time.  However, I did not receive the wake-up call and there was no shuttle -  surprise !    The lady working at my check-out 5:30 am  shift explained there was no wake-up call request made.  Also, there are about 10 shuttle services and they all charge at least $ 9.00.   So, my only call to my room must have been a prank, even though they usually do shut down phone service during upgrades.  \n\nOk,  lets wrap it up.   1.  Efficient check in.   2. Helpful housekeeping.   3. No extra resort \""surprise\"" fees.   \n\nUse Priceline and bid $30.00 for a 2-occupancy room.  Don't forget to bring a set of foamy ear plugs."
0,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!"
0,"Came in from out of town, from Charleston. The restaurant was pretty packed (many college football games were on so we definitely understood the long wait since we all work in food and bev) so we went upstairs to grab a drink while we waiting. Bartender was very rude, didn't crack a smile once. Waited about an hour for a table. Caught one of the hostess giving us dirty looks and even rolled her yes at us once, not to sure why? We got our table took 20 mins for a server to come over. Got our food and it was absolutely awful! Fries were cold chicken seemed raw and rubbery. Overall wouldn't feed it to my dogs. Extremely bad experience. Rude all around."
3,"After a long day of shopping, Doan's does not disappoint!! \nWe had spring rolls made with chicken and shrimp instead of traditional pork. My dad won't eat any red meat or pork, and the staff was wonderful with that! The spring rolls were served with the traditional peanut sauce which seemed a little less sweeter than normal, which was great for me. The crispy egg rolls were a little over crispy for my liking but they had great flavor. They were served with the fish sauce and a sweet duck-type sauce. We ordered traditional pho, noodle soup with pork and shrimp and a vermicelli bowl. They made my dad a special bowl with shrimp, vegetarian rolls and chicken...for no additional cost! My pho was very flavorful, and not salty at all! I cannot have additional salt in my diet, so eating out has become a challenge...but I LOVE to try new restaurants. We will come back here often!! Oh...and they serve unsweetened tea, my glass was never empty! And the hot tea was great as well!!"
2,"\""Meh\"" is a great expression to describe this location. Not all Chompie's are created equal - our waitress was nice, but my hubby ordered the \""tuna melt\"" but it came with no cheese, so it was more like a tuna....hm. what do you call that? He also ordered an egg cream, but they were out of that - not a big deal, but my hot chocolate didn't come with the whipped cream it was supposed to come with, so that was lame.\n\nI ordered 2 original pancakes {can't really mess that up} and I got eggs on the side, with melted cheddar cheese. They have  DELICIOUS syrup and gave me as much as I needed.\n\nIf you end up dining at this location, just stay on top of your order. You might need to ask if they are even carrying what you want, before you order it."
1,I only gave them two stars because they had the game on. Other than that this place is gross! I ordered a simple chicken tortilla soup and it was cold. I also order a glass of wine...UHG not cool. I have to admit the wine was cool but that wine glass was dingy and disgusting-.- the silver ware look like it had been through World War II . The waitress act like she had an attitude if we had a question. Not liking this place. This is the first time and definitely the last. Oh please STAY AWAY FROM THE SHRIMP AVOCADO SALASA... my mother got sick right after she ate it....
2,"This location is very busy. It seems most every time I'm here (about once a week), they're out of everything we want to order. I love their iced tea, the donuts are just okay; I usually get a plain bagel with cream cheese - when they're not out of bagels. ha"
4,"I have been here before, but this was the first time for my parents. They and we absolutely love the food here. Good price and huge portion sizes. This is a great place for family and friends and the staff is also excellent. If you are in the city and need a place to eat that kind if takes you back to old Vegas, this is your stop."
2,"Ceci est la meilleure place pour acheter des condoms extra larges.  Il y a un grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de choix de condom, m\u00eame pour les femmes. Mireille m'a expliqu\u00e9 la meilleure technique de mettre un condom avec un p\u00e9nis large et \u00e9pais. (C'est  plus compliqu\u00e9 que tu pense) \n\nThis is the best place to buy condoms,  even if you don't speak French, there is so much variety over here, don't hesitate to come by and check it out :) the only reason why I am not giving 5 stars was because the sales people only speak French ."
1,"After going to a Halloween party and drinking, it sounded like a good idea to eat something that would absorb the alcohol.  We ordered Fish and Chips.  \n\nThe chips were good but the fish was not fresh and smelled so bad that I couldn't even finish my first bite.  I am sure the person cooking it knew the fish was not good but still decided to serve it.  Yes! smelled that bad\n\nThis had to be the worst meal I've had in Vegas.  Will not be coming back here again."
0,"Very bad. We had been here maybe 3 years ago and did not remember much.  It is a great location though, & so we went.  We love Mexican food.  We have been to more Mexican places than I can count.  This has to be one of the worst.  When we sat down, seconds later, the waiter asks\"" ready to order\""? No drinks offered, no appetizers offere..  We asked for a margarita.  Small or large?  That was it for choices. So, we went small.  Thank God.  Yucky.  Okay, moving on.. Ordered dinner.  I had a combo plate.  Hubby had a beef burrito.  Very basic.  When in doubt, don't stretch the kitchen.  Both our dinners were bad. Not even warm.  Tasteless, greasy. We had to ask for hot sauce.  The only condiment on the table was salt & pepper.  To top off the nite, hubby needed to use the restroom.  You have to walk outside to get to it? I heard the table next to us commenting on how dirty the restrooms were. All I can say is,save your money.  Go somewhere else."
0,Service is beyond bad.  Have currently been sitting down for the past 20 minutes without service. :(
4,"Wow!  I just had the best massage ever! We were able to make an appt. for 3 massages on the same day.  If you get a facial or massage there, you can use their facility all day from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.  It includes the co-ed pool, sauna, steam room, hot-stone room, Himalayan salt room and jacuzzi. The salt room had REALLY loud music though, which I wasn't really expecting in such a relaxing environment.\n\nI had the specialty massage by Kara and she was great!  The pressure was perfect and they customize it to your needs.  The facility is really clean and they have a lot of amenities for you while you're there.  Everyone from the front desk to the people picking up the towels are extremely friendly and they always have a smile on their face.  I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas!"
0,"Good food. HORRIBLE service! We were a larger party, so they sat us at the little craft table or whatever it was in the market. That's fine. We wanted dinner, so we were okay with that.\n\nWhat wasn't fine was they didn't even clear it off. They left a price gun and a bunch of paperwork on the table. Strike one.\n\nWe have three different people approach us in the time we placed a drink order, and received our drinks. One member of our party ordered a beer on draft, and they brought him a bottle. I ordered a diet coke, and they brought me a canned diet coke. Not in the mood to pay for multiple cokes, I switched and ordered sweet tea. \n\nAfter waiting FOREVER to get our drinks, we had a different person approach us to take our orders. This time it was a woman, and she did a great job of explaining the specials to us, but when I said I'd like one of them, she told me they were out of it. Okay, so why bother telling me about it? Strike two.\n\nSome of us ordered appetizers, and about twenty minutes after we ordered them they arrived. My husband and I had the hummus, and it was delicious. What wasn't awesome is that they give you a decent sized bowl of hummus and like 6 small wedges of pita bread to dip in it. I guess we were supposed to scoop the rest out and eat it with a spoon. \n\nAnyways. About 45 minutes AFTER our appetizers, we finally received our meals. Everything was fantastic. I had a delicious mediterranean pizza and my husband's steak was delicious. \n\nBut this is the part that outraged me. Our waitress was God awful at filling our drinks. Two of us had sweet tea. We asked FOUR times for refills, and we never got them. She kept saying they were brewing fresh tea and she'd bring us some out, but she never did. After they took our plates, we waited about another 30 minutes for the check. Finally, I was at my wits end and asked for a manager. The slow service, I can handle. The crap on the table they sat us at, I can handle. The bringing out a bottled beer when my friend specifically ordered draft, I can handle. But having to ask FOUR times for a refill is outrageous and unacceptable."
1,"This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\n \n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\u00f6rhead tank top. I am a huge Mot\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\n \n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\n \n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better."
4,"This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions).  It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. \n\nBut more importantly the food...  Oh, the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.  \n\nI"
0,"Booked a suite at the Plaza for my boyz, the Legends of Hokona, for the purpose of watching the Super Bowl.\n\nThis place is a relic, with worn out armchairs lined up in the lobby (ca 1974).  There have been no attempts to remodel this place in at least 15 years. One of the \""guests\"" wandering through the lobby was sporting eau de urine cologne.\n\nWent up to the 23rd floor (after abandoning one elevator which did not work) and the foyer was picturesque to say the least.  The brass plaques with the floor number were all scratched out and had gang graffiti on them. Nice.\n\nWe were able to go into the parlor of the suite and only one of the bedrooms, they were still kicking out the previous \""guests\"".  This was at about 330pm.  We turned the tv on in time to see the kickoff (that was close).\n\nThe suite featured none of the following:\nFlat screen or big screen TV\nMicrowave oven\n\nThere was, however, paint on the tables and a teeny fridge.  One of the legends pointed out that there was a nice view of Freemont street.  You can't see the Experience from above, however.  But there is a good view of the hotel sign: Pl za (the A is missing).\n\nOne final note, if you are coming into Las Vegas by bus, definitely stay at the Plaza because the hotel and the bus station are in the same building.  ha!"

3,"You can not beat the steak and eggs special before 9am !\nNever had a bad meal here, Breakfast Lunch. Never ate dinner, only open on Friday evenings.\nStaff is attentive and friendly.\nVery casual Diner type atmosphere. Huge booths for big parties or privacy."
4,"Amazing service and even better food! We got the \""tasting menu\"" that walks through all of Chef Ramsay's signature dishes. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. Can't wait to go back!"
4,"This is THE BEST kept secret in Las Vegas. Almost debated on reviewing, so I could be selfish and KEEP it a secret, but it was so good, I have to give the owners props. \n\nHere are all the reasons this place deserves MORE than 5 stars.\n\n- Came at 10am on a Saturday and everyone was friendly. We actually had no wait, but I think that was more luck :) But it's still a positive in my book.\n- Bread in a Pot. Delicious cinnamon swirled bread that was soft and buttery. Almost like a croissant... warm and came with whipped butter and strawberry jam. TO DIE FOR!!!\n- My Man got the filet wrapped in bacon with eggs - cooked perfectly. The meat was tender, and you could tell it wasn't just cooked properly but that this place orders high quality ingredients.\n- I got the chicken fried steak and eggs, and WHOA, the outside was cooked so crispy, and flavorful. Had a little spice kick to it which made it even better. Eggs cooked perfectly. \n- The side of potatoes were seasoned like an expect would. Not too salty, full of flavor. I don't like ketchup, and at other places I always end up with bland hash browns that need flavor and ketchup is the obvious choice but these tasted excellent plain. TWO thumbs up!!\n- They serve illy coffee, and it is so good. Much better than typical diner coffee. It was refilled without me asking - another thumbs up!\n- The server was friendly and cheery but not TOO cheery if you know what I mean \n- 3/4 through our meal, the owner stopped by. I think this is what tipped the review. He was friendly, and I LOOOOOOVE when someone in charge stops by your table. They should come by when things are good and bad, and not just when there is a customer complaint. He truly wanted to see how everything was, and it was very personable. Obviously we raved about the place to him, and I can't say enough what a great first impression it gave us.\n- My man is an executive chef, and even he said this is the best place we have EVER had breakfast (totally exceeds Hash House, Egg & I, Cracked Egg, or ANY OTHER PLACE)\n\n\nWe will be back for sure. Our favorite thing on the weekends is to go out for breakfast, and this is definitely our new spot."
0,"After hearing such great things about this and reading the awesome reviews I twisted my girlfriends arm last night and convinced her we should check this place out instead of our normal sushi spots... well it ended up giving her a reason to say she told me so.  Either everyone writing awesome reviews about this place has never had sushi before, or they are getting paid to tell everyone how awesome and amazing this place it.  The food was very bland and didn't look as though it was the best quality.  I even tried out the Garlic Chicken per all the reviews, while that was pretty decent it was nothing to rave about.\nEven though this place is right around the corner and really quick to get to, I dont think I will ever be going back to it."
2,"I love this place. Sure, it's crowded, the coffee isn't that great, and teenagers swarm the place, but it's a big landmark in the Phoenix area. \n\nGrowing up in Phoenix and going to school around the area, Coffee Plantation has turned into a second home. Regretfully I was one of those teenagers that swarmed the place, but they usually grow up to have the same consideration for the spot like the adults before us. Even my older siblings were the annoying tweens around CP, but even as they and I grew up, CP never gets old.\n\nNo matter how crappy the service may be, it is a staple of Phoenix to me and to many others. I'm sad to see that it has closed down. It's the best place to go late at night when you just want to sit and chat with your friends. \n\nParking has gotten a lot better, a lot of people forget about the huge garage the Biltmore has. Many just try and get a spot right in front when the garage is just a short walk away."
0,"Decided to stop in to Perk Eatery on a Tuesday morning shortly before 8. About \u00bc of the tables were filled. I was by myself. Seated and told that my waiter would be right with me. Look through the menu. Then I look around and there's lot's of Guy Fieri stuff there. They must have been on the DDD show. Ok, so now I've been there probably 7-8 minutes. Guy comes and cleans up the table next to me. I say \""Good Morning.\"" He says \""Good Morning.\"" Then he leaves. There appears to be some debate going on amongst the staff about who does what. Strange. I just want someone to bring me some coffee. So I wait and I wait and I wait. At 8:15 a group of 3 is seated adjacent to me and someone brings them coffee and takes their order. Seriously, even if you thought(mistakenly) that I was waiting for someone don't you think I might want something to drink. So I left without any fanfare. I was hungry but they won't get my business. Ever."
4,One of the best Italian spots in the Greater Phoenix area....I dont understand the bad reviews on the food as I have been many times and have Never had a bad meal....Go and see if Im lying!
0,"My husband, daughter and I stopped here for lunch. We chose this place as they touted having the \""best burger in Charlotte\"".  There was only one other table with anyone at it, and there were 3 tables filled on the patio. The aesthetics were nice, but the service and food left much to be desired. The waitress walked by us several times without acknowledging us and when she did, we were smart enough to just order. That didn't change the fact that we waited way too long for our food. Once we got our food, it was just ok. The bacon was wilted, there was no seasoning on the burgers, and the Mac and cheese tasted microwaved. To top it all off, for 2 burgers and a kids meal, it was $50.  We are willing to pay for good food and we tip well. This place just did not deserve it. I completely understand why the waitress never asked how everything was.  As we are driving home, my husband is complaining of a stomach ache, and he NEVER gets sick. \n\nWe will NOT be back, and hopefully the leftovers we brought won't kill our dogs."
3,"Fast, yummy, EXTREMELY reasonable prices..I will definitely get take-out from there again!"
4,The soft pretzel app is the bomb! I get it everytime I go. Service is always awesome and they have great drink specials. This is a great place to go for great food in a bar atmosphere
4,Best steak in town.
0,"The decor was nice... that's all.\n\nMy friends went here a couple weeks ago and gave praises to the food, atmosphere, and reverse happy-hour on Saturday. They wanted to go again this last Friday and I came along.\n\nThe atmosphere is really nice. I could imagine this being our new place to hang out for dinner and drinks. The menu was also very cleverly worded and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to try anything.\n\nWe were the only table seated. There were a few people at the bar, in the karaoke room, and on the couches near the front. The dining area was basically empty. \n\nOur group of 4 was seated and we received our menus very quickly, but were then ignored for the next 15 minutes as the wait staff meandered around moving tables and repeatedly wiping them off. We're a patient bunch, but not with an empty dining room.\n\nWe all agreed to just get up and leave. I doubt we will be coming back."
2,"Typical of all Chipotle restaurants.  \n\nParking is adequate, staff are friendly, restaurant surroundings not so clean - tables were dirty and the floor/rug around the soda machine was soaked without any accompanying sign indicating there was a wet floor (-1).  \n\nBathroom facilities was clean.  \n\nRestaurant was a bit on the small side but I've noticed that with most of them.  Lines were long and to give you perspective of how small the place was, while you stood in line, you can literally be standing over people who're eating at their tables which was the case when we visited (-1).\n\nSeeing as it's the only one that I know of in town, I don't have much of a choice if I'm in the mood for Chipotle."
4,"Food: Very good.  I had the white spinach/artichoke/prosciutto pizza - my wife had the chicken masala ravioli special.  We shared a caprese salad with fresh-made mozzarella.\n\nService: Excellent.  Our server Drew was a pro - knew the menu well, was able to make good menu recommendations as well as recommending wine.\n\nNoise: It was Friday night and there was live music, so it was loud - but not punishingly so."
0,Well stocked -  new and expensive Walgreens... \n\nI was informed that you don't get Walgreen's loyalty points on your card even if they do swipe it for you - guess it saves the argument... \n\nI only noticed after I had been a number of times and the points total never changed .. then I asked \n\nSo since then I have been using the numerous CVS stores that are on the strip and elsewhere  ..\n\nBetter prices and loyalty points too.
2,"Paradise Valley is pretty mediocre as far as malls go, but it's still better than Metrocenter. It a single level mall with quite a few stores, but nothing too thrilling. I guess it's a nice mall if you're looking for somewhere to walk around and browse on one of your Saturday afternoons. It's also managed to keep most of their stores leased, unlike Metrocenter. I don't know why a Costco was added though, Costco just doesn't fit in with shopping malls."
2,"Food: 3\n\nI was expecting more from this based on accolades and was disappointed with the pizza and cheesesteak sandwich. I tried the original cheesesteak wit whiz and it was \""ok\"" due to lack of seasoning. It was filling to say the least, and the ribeye was tender, but just not as flavorful as I expected.\n\nOn the pizza side, we had the spicy italian red and it wasn't spicy. It was greasy (yeah, I know sausage will make it greasy) although the crust was very good. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would probably eat here again, but I would not drive from the strip for it."
4,We have taken our 1.5yr old labradoodle to 5 different groomers and they all had trouble with her.  Sometimes they can't even finish because she is too anxious and playful.  Wag N Wash has groomed her twice now perfectly.  Most recently Lindsey groomed her and did an amazing job.  I couldn't believe what an amazing job she did and she acted like it was no problem.  The store is super clean employees are so nice. For putting up with my pup and having such a wonderful attitude I wont go anywhere else.
0,"My dog has been boarded and groomed by this store for 10 years. She is now almost 12 years old and the grooming salon decided she is too old for them to bath and cut her. \""She is feeble.\"" Tessie is a Welsh Terrier and is sweet as can be. I think everyone should be aware of their feelings to older dogs. This store should be ashamed!!"
4,Sehr empfehlenswert!!\nNettes kleines stilvoll eingerichtetes Restaurant und ein nettes Team. Waren schon \u00f6fters dort und das Essen war immer sehr sehr gut und das zu fairen Preisen. Werden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen. 5 von 5 Sternen :-)
1,"It is just ok. They do a ok job with the pedicure. But they don't have any ideas for nail art. There are just two nail technicians out here. So on the plus side, there is not much wait time and they do a good foot massage."
2,"I have visited over thirty different Rock Cafe's throughout the world including the two franchises here in Las Vegas the location on the strip has a lot less memorabilia than the off strip location, however they do have live music from time to time. The food is standard to all locations and my favorite dishes the giant sampler for an appetizer with a rack of ribs as the main course always hits the spot. The drinks are fine and I rotate through a few favorites to obtain my collectors hurricane glass. The staff was ok not up to standards of the normal hard rock cafe's. The manager did make an effort to meet and greet with all the patrons so that was a plus."
2,"I had the #3 Steak Kebab sans lettuce for $9.13. They gave me a drink and a few fries along with the kebab in the pita. They pile in a massive amount  of the steak cubes garnished with onions, tomatoes and this sauce. I didn't really care for the sauce and will have to try this without the sauce. This is a comfortable place indoors with nice wooden tables and chairs. There is limited outdoor seating."
0,"Do not use,  Manager Danielle in the call center is the most rude shady person I have ever talk to in my life."
0,"so i don't know what happened here, this pharmacy used to be on top of it. now they take a long time to get to drive-through customers, long wait times and rude pharmacy techs."
3,Super trendy restaurant with pretty decent food. Service is kind of slow and the place is loud but it's in a great location and definitely a fun place to go whether it's your first or only stop of the night. \n\nIf you like other Sam Fox restaurants like Sauce you will probably like this place. The pretzels which cheese fondue are so yummy!
3,"We have been to this place on several occasions.  The latest visit was the best yet.  The waitress was really on top of everything!  The food was really delicious and cooked exactly to our specifications.  Even though this is a chain, it's one of the best burger places around!  Yum!"
2,It was a decent experience.
4,"Nous sommes all\u00e9es \u00e0 la Croissanterie aujourd'hui. Moi, j'ai pris un croissant et je ne regrettait pas mon choix. Les croissants se fondent dans la bouche! Le caf\u00e9 \u00e9tait bon, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Mon chum a pris un burger qui le trouvait bon aussi. La serveuse \u00e9tait gentille et souriante. Mais, je crois qu'il faut l'aller pour les croissants!"
2,"For Carson street, I really enjoyed the crowd in this place. Laid back with a \""chill out\"" ambience.. It felt like college all over again! It's turned out to be my go-to destination for the start of a night out. Ok who am I kidding here, the flaming Dr. Pepper shots have me there through last call on the usual...."
2,"We met at this lounge two days before my wedding in Las Vegas so my friends and family could have a few drinks together, and for some so they could meet before the wedding.  The staff at Hyde treated us great, though there was only 1 server for about 20 of us.  We were given a reserved section of tables overlooking the fountains, thanks (I think) to the concierge at the Platinum Hotel who set it up.  The view was fantastic, as was the band that started playing later on in the evening.  I couldn't have asked for a better surroundings.\nThe downsides: the food was just OK.  The drinks were tasty but between 15 and 20$ each - if you are from a smaller city this seems outrageous, but on the strip it turned out to be pretty standard."
4,Amazing pizza... the crust is on point and there is the right amount of cheese. I normally eat 1-2 slices but with Luisa's I stuff 1/2 a pizza in. For some reason not a lot of people I know eat here... I am slowly converting them to Luisa's lovers by bringing them pizza from here. I prefer to order for pick up but have eaten there a few times and its a good family friendly place. I hear rave reviews about the lunch buffet from co-workers..
0,Keep looking!\n\nOur move was a nightmare was the start.  After confirming the day before that the packers would arrive @ noon to pack everything and the movers would arrive at 2:30pm.  The movers showed up at 2:30pm shocked to find that nothing had been packed yet.  After multiple calls to Graebel Headquarters - (with them at first telling us that we never asked for packing) they had to hurry and get the movers to pack everything up.  Their esitmate was under by almost 65%  (WARNING: THE CONTRACT YOU SIGN STATES THAT YOU ARE PAYING BY THE POUND - NOT BY THEIR ESTIMATE ) So that estimate doesnt do anything except to entice you to use them.  they have NO reason to give you an honest quote since at the end of the service they SIMPLY CHARGE by the pound.  P E R I O D.  \n\nOur original quote was $1600\n\nActual cost $2729
0,"Went to get nails done for the panthers playoff game. Wanted a black base w/ blue stripes. The younger girl did them and did a bad job. The worst part she even told me it was \""not her best\"" and she was disappointed with how she did them. The lines were all different sizes. She made an excuse that the brush was too big. She was about 3/4 of the way done and about 4 woman came in to get their nails done...the girl decided to rush through my nails to quickly get me done, i guess she figured she had already screwed up so no need to keep trying. Then I sat to dry and the owner came and sprayed some kind of quick dry on them and it caused the paint to sort of bubble up......yeah and paid about double since it was a design...even though it was my regular nails.  Only reason I would go back is for a basic manicure or pedicure...hopefully couldn't mess that up."
4,"Moved from Vegas 4 years ago to Orange county and still have not found anywhere even close. I literally take their roll menu with me and point to the Sushi Chef to make a roll off their menu, and it's not even close. I can't wait to go there everytime I am in Vegas. Love the 1/2 rolls on EVERY type of roll. Wait staff reviews by others were kind of a raw deal. The wait staff is attentive, most places purposefully leave you alone so you won't stay so long for AYCE sushi. Love my Sushi Mon....."
4,"My roommate and I were at Westgate, and jonesing for some sushi. I had been to Kabuki a couple of times before and enjoyed it, so we went on up!\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar, our favorite place to sit when we go out for sushi. There's just something about having a front row seat and seeing your food being prepared in such a meticulous way. \n\nOur sushi chef was fun and friendly. He gave us our rolls in carefully measured increments, so that we weren't overwhelmed with plates and food. I appreciated that! \n\nThe food was delicious, I would highly recommend the AAA box sushi roll. It was a great combination of flavors. So tasty!\n\nOne of the better restaurants in Westgate, hands down."
1,"A small little Mexican joint located in a small shopping center, Mr Taco is decent food, but nothing special. I prefer several other small Mexican restaurants to this place, that have better tasting food.\n\nThis place is pretty small, but I've never seen it packed. It received some publicity in the Charlotte Observer a while back as a Mexican \""find,\"" so that's the reason I checked it out. The Mexican dishes are your typical ones, but I've definitely had better. One plus is that it's pretty cheap so you're wallet won't be hurt too badly.\n\nOverall, there are plenty of other hole in the wall Mexican restaurants near Mr Taco in Charlotte that are around the same price, with better food."
0,"***WOULD NEVER RETURN***\n\nWe celebrated my brother in-law's birthday here last week & had a horrible time. First, our waiter was very impatient to get everybody's drink order. He had a huge attitude with several guests as they were going back & forth asking questions about cocktails. But after everyone was finished ordering (a table of about 15) we went to the salad bar to start. The salad bar had some hot items and a good variety of appetizer-esque dishes. \nCut to about 30 minutes later when our drinks finally arrived... AWFUL! Didn't even bother drinking the nasty cocktail that was served. Good thing we didn't want anything else because our waiter NEVER RETURNED TO THE TABLE!!!!!! We were a large party there for about 2+ hours and only saw our waiter when he took the drink orders & then when the bill was paid.... WTF!?\nNext the meat started to arrive... Finally we would \""get our monies worth\""... WRONG. Meat was bland, overcooked & of poor quality. You would think a Brazilian Steakhouse would offer quality proteins, maybe that was too much to ask. \nWhile the majority of us went with the Surf & Turf a member of our party had ordered a simply medium rare fillet mignon with a potato side which took OVER AN HOUR to arrive. By which time we were ready to pack our bags so we got it boxed to go & our friend left without eating a thing.\nI would never recommend this place to anyone nor will we ever return. The service was horrendous, the drinks awful & the food disgusting."
3,"I rarely have a doughnut. I think most doughnuts, like breakfast places, are exactly the same. That or they're notably terrible. It's a black and white world. However, I heard about this place and saw a picture of the Fat Elvis and had to give it a shot.\n\nI pretty much ordered one of everything. I will say, with confidence, everything is fresh and delicious. Given, I still think doughnuts are mostly hype, but these had measurable freshness. There is a good mix of \""bready\"" texture and \""pastry\"" in the mix. It's just right. The Fat Elvis definitely stole the show for me. Even a simple cake covered in chocolate with peanuts sprinkled on top was a little more impressive than the competition. Oddly, though, my typical favorite doughnut - the apple fritter - was a bit underwhelming compared to some others I've had.\n\nSo, why not 5 stars? Because it's just a doughnut shop in terms of appearance and ambiance and there is definitely more to be had. Unless I just don't understand that people never stick around with doughnuts anyway."
1,"This location is really close to home and I like to stop in about once a week in the morning and get an order if biscuits and gravy and a coffee. Sometimes the gravy is awesome with pieces of sausage and a really good biscuit, but more recently the gravy is awful. It is often too thick, but this morning there were giant lumps in it and no sausage. The biscuit was also hard and undercooked. Here's a thought-if it's not ready don't serve it. I would rather be told it's not ready then sent on my way with terrible food. Another peeve-I always order a large coffee and somehow it always comes in a different size cup. I know it's a fast food joint, but a little consistency would be nice."
1,The long line at CPK for a weekend dinner is testament to the triumph  of good location over mediocre food and not very good service by the  frazzled staff.
4,"Awesome people, beautifully organized shop and very reasonable prices for good quality work. Can't say enough good things about Jason, who is extremely organized and meticulous. If you, like me- are particular and methodical, this is the place to come to for your car."
0,"This was the most disgusting place I have ever been to, I am so seriously surprised that the health department is allowing this place to stay open, I found an unidentified object in my soup, this place was so nasty, the windows you cannot see out of from the filth, the food is GROSSSSSSSS. This is just a depressing environment, not a place to waste 10.00 on a meal."
3,"This place was pretty good, although I wasn't feeling that great during or after, but I don't think it was due to the food.  Too bad because I could have really torn through quite a bit of this stuff.  Lamb chops were excellent.  Hand made sushi as well, nice!"
0,"We have visited this location many times over the past year and dropped a LOT of money here. Consistently BAD service.  They never have Iced Tea in the metal containers (even though they will try and sell you some and then do a bait and switch and offer some other drink).  We watch the manager sitting off at a side table playing on her cell phone.  The help seems to always be in a state of oblivion and moving at half speed.  Bagel bins are typically empty and not restocked by early afternoon. And the floor is always dirty with pieces of food, wrappers, etc. laying around.  The help at this store (both male and female) need a commando type manager here to kick some proverbial a___ and get these 18 to 24 year olds to care, clean up, and restock ice tea containers.  General lack of caring. The shift manager needs to get off her phone.  I hope the owner reads this, but who knows, maybe they are behind this lack of caring.  Generally a slip shod operation.  And oh yeah - it is hot.  Mr. owner FIX your AC once and for all."
2,"This was our first visit.  Anticipating a rush for a Friday evening, my husband and I got to the restaurant at 6pm.  The restaurant was about a third full and we were seated immediately.  The interior is nice.  Simple but cozy.  I really liked the curved ceiling.  \n\nFor drinks, my husband ordered a glass of Sangiovese.  I had a couple sips and it was nice...buttery is the only word I can think of.    I ordered the blood orange champagne.  The orange bitters were very subtle and I enjoyed the presentation of the sugar cube at the bottom of the glass flute.  \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the crudo and the shattered chips.  The crudo that night was ahi tuna with citrus avocado and red jalapeno peppers.  It  was delicious, very fresh and I really enjoyed the tangy/spicy flavors.  The shattered chips were very thinly sliced potatoes sprinkled with salt and fresh herbs.  Very crisp and yummy.  \n\nFor entrees, my husband ordered the spaghetti + meatballs and I ordered the pappardelle + bolognese sauce.  The two dishes were nicely prepared and flavored but not something that will knock your socks off. \n\nI was really interested in the olive oil cake but was full from the drinks, apps and entrees, so we ordered it to go.  The cake comes with some cherry jam and real cream.  I had it the next morning for breakfast and it was delicious.  Very moist and the cream was just heavenly.\n\nAll in all, a nice place.  I really liked the cool, trendy but casual vibe.  The service was friendly and spot on.  I will definitely come back again to try the other dishes.\n\nBe forewarned:  there is a lack of parking (unless you get lucky across the street at LGO), but there is complimentary valet provided."
3,I really like the ambient in this place.... the food is always outstanding and the drinks prepared it right and nice for any kind of taste. the servers always nice and warmth and when they have the alive band is a nice going party... great for a date to impress.!!
4,I love the food here. It's always so good and fresh. Also the people here are really nice and kind.
2,It ok food.  I've had better Mexican food.  Portion is small and little high price for fast Mexican food.
4,"I had a torn knee meniscus, and had arthroscopic surgery repair.  I will describe the surgical experience below; the focus of this review is not on whether the surgery was successful but on the mostly non-surgical things I feel qualified to judge.\n\nA 5 star rating would mean there is little that could have realistically been better while 3 star would mean it was acceptable with lots of room for improvement.  I am not considering pricing.\n\nRating is 5 stars.  The overall experience felt professional.  The waiting room is pleasant, clean and with comfortable seating.  The staff was uniformly good with a high level of competence.  They did well with follow-up and providing information about what was happening and what the processes would be like, what to expect, etc.  Not a criticism, an observation: once you are being seen everything was efficient.  Not like they were rushing you but you could tell they have other patients and they know how long exams and presenting information should take.  \n\nThey have a related company with an MRI onsite and also a surgery center.  I am cautious about such arrangements because it can incentivize unneeded testing.  But in this case I did not get that sense and the convenience was well worth it.  I checked the MRI pricing and it was very competitive.  I also liked that if the image quality was bad, Dr, Bigler could easily order a reschedule without hassle.\n\nCons:  On several occasions I had long waits before being seen.  Over an hour. The Dr. did apologize without me bringing it up and it felt sincere.\n\nMy interactions with Dr. Bigler were all positive.  Call it bedside manner, he conveys confidence and explains clearly balancing quantity of information with your ability to understand.  You can tell he has presented the same information many times, but it is not rushed and he is looking for you to show you understand.\n\nMy surgical experience, this is no longer part of the review.  I am writing this about 6 weeks after surgery.  My injury required removal of 15% of the outside meniscus, which I gather to be one the easiest to recover from.  Once I decided to go ahead with surgery, they schedule a pre-operative meeting.  A nurse went over day of surgery scheduling and what to expect, lost of paperwork.  Dr. Bigler had previously explained the surgery itself, what to expect as far as healing, etc.  The anesthesiologist contacted me the day prior to surgery to go over questions (can't remember his name but he was very good, an ex-motorcycle racer).  Don't eat night before, day of surgery.  Surgery itself was almost anticlimactic, I just relaxed as much as possible and let the team move me along.  It was almost a relaxed environment, everyone knowing what they needed to do.  Bam I was out, then woke up in recovery with a very bandaged knee.  \n\nBandage can't get wet, and it was 3 days until it was removed.  Good luck with the sponge bathing.  During this time extremely little pain.  I stayed on crutches for the first 3 days, although I could put slight pressure on the leg.  Icing helped a lot and found that I continued to use ice during the next 6 weeks.  The bandage hid things, but there was substantial swelling which is normal.  I took one pain pill the first night as I went to bed as a precaution, but after that just the occasional Tylenol.  After the bandage was off, I would use one crutch as a kind of cane to get around.  It might have been possible to do without the crutch but I was nervous about putting on too much pressure.  For much of the first week the leg was elevated and when possible iced.  I stopped using crutches after the first week, but as mentioned continued icing which really helped.  \n\nI started physical therapy the week after surgery, going twice a week.  In my very specific case, twice a week was wasted.  The first day of real therapy you go through a bunch of exercises that are outlined on a printout, mostly using your own weight with some supplemental rubber resistance bands.  These are very simple exercises that you will continue to do at home.  So, when I went back for the next therapy session, almost all of the time was simply doing the same exercise I was doing just fine at home.  At the end of the session the therapist came by to evaluate my knee, so there is value in that.  I have access to a gym and with the printout felt comfortable reducing therapy and ending it earlier than planned.\nThe first 3 weeks the swelling was very noticeable.  Once I started therapy in earnest I had discomfort but no real pain.  Icing helped a lot.  I lost about 3-4 lbs of muscle on the leg.  The biggest challenge was getting into the car; the ability to bend the knee was very limited.  I also found driving two footed worked best.  I could do a 20 minute walk the dogs, but that was my limit.\nFrom 3-6 weeks progress seemed more rapid."
2,"After seeing a huge sign on their building stating $0.99 tacos and drafts on Tuesdays and Thursdays I knew I had to check it out. Three awesome things... cheap prices, Mexican food and beer!\n\nWe arrived right before the Pirates game and the place was pretty dead. We decided to sit at the bar and the bartender/server gave us the remote to put the game on. Cool! Obviously we wanted to get right to drinking. I noticed there was probably about ten different drafts available. I decided to get a Blue Moon but figured I'd check first to make sure that BM was included in the deal. It wasn't. Only Bud Light, Coors and YL. Still a decent selection, but if I didn't ask I would have been upset at my bill at the end of the night. The beer itself was okay. It wasn't super cold and they serve it in a glass that's clearly not meant for beer. It's probably big enough to fill just a little more than a regular 12 oz. can of beer. They're $0.99, though. Can't really complain.\n\nThe tacos were decent. They are hard shells (no soft shells with the special) with an average amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and cheeses. The meat was better than I expected as I thought it was going to taste like fake Taco Bell filler considering they were $0.99. They also filled up our chip basket twice and the salsa is very yummy!\n\nService is so so. The server was away from the bar probably half of the night. The drink specials only last till 9, so my boyfriend was waiting for her to come over to get him a new one. Time kept ticking and she was nowhere to be found. At 8:57 she comes over and says the \""special is over.\"" No, it's not. We showed her our phones and she agreed to give him two more beers. \n\nI think the place is worth trying, especially considering how cheap their specials are. However, nothing screamed at me to want to return."
4,"Had the Lunch buffet, best Indian I've had on the west side by far. I've had 8 other Indian restaurants, and none of them have come close to being this good. \n\nFirst positive sign, everyone in the place was Indian. Second positive sign, all the food was spicy. Had to ask for a Masala Dosa for my daughter so that she could eat.\n\nDelicious. Will be back soon.\n\nThere was a TV that was too loud. I really hate having TV on at places, let alone with volume on. Someone asked they turn it down, and they I think didn't understand the English well enough to comply.\n\nCould be an issue going forward."
1,"I took my cousin for food at this place. To be honest is was subpar. We both got a burger ( i got a double, which was under a 1/4 lb), fries and a shake. The total was $18 little pricey for a fast food restaurant. I personally thought the burger fast like Burger King. Def nothing to write home about. The service was very nice. They were very helpful. The honey mustard dipping sauce taste like sweet yogurt with salt lol (not tasty, even to the nickelodeon teenager). The inside was very cool and old fashion layout. Just something I would expect a old fashion burger joint to be setup like. I enjoyed the ambience feel. Just can't recommend it for flavor-value ratio. If you just want a quick shake worth a stop. Could use a drive thru at this location."
1,"This is solely about the restaurant.\n\nWorst hooter's wings I have ever eaten.  Ordered hot sauce and it wasn't even medium hot.  Coating was thick and not particularly crispy.  Not yummy taste.\n\nService was pretty good....and they had $3.00 shots of Crown Royal.\n\nLounge band was all female, bass player was really talented, lead singer was tone deaf and substituted volume and  shaking her groove thang for talent.\n\nAwful experience, will never go back and sorry that I went in the first place.\n\nDid not bother gambling."
0,"Lousy scratched up car. 20k miles on it. No USB port. But it was clean and ran well. \n\nThe shuttle back to the airport was hilariously bad.  The guy sat I'm the lot empty for 10 mins, them proceeded to wait until he was sardine full before he left event though two other shuttles were there. Traffic was horrible and he inched along. A guy pleaded to get off and walk due to tight schedule but he refused. Twice."
2,I stayed in the Harrah's casino so this place was just next door.  I found it near the end of my stay and wish I had found it sooner as I love a good Korean soup after a night of drinking and gambling.  And this place is open 24/7!!! The food was as decent as I've ever gotten for Korean in LV but didn't have to take a cab to get to it.  The waitress was very nice and the food was very authentic. Prices are as expect for Korean and fair for Japanese although I haven't tried anything other than Korean yet.  I will go back next time.
1,Not good to me they messed up on my order the food was okay but not all that. I don't think I will go back there nice place I don't think I will go back there nice place that the food wasn't that great but  the food wasn't that great
1,"Cons:\n\n*Pretty damn expensive, considering what they offer ($32 for the weekend brunch)\n*No crab legs \n*Food temperatures range from lukewarm to ice cold\n*Every meat item was dry as hell\n*No crab legs\n*Everything tasted pretty bad\n*There are better buffets in vegas for under 10 bucks \n*IT WAS OVER $30 AND NO CRAB LEGS\n\nPros:\n\n*The line was pretty short (It was almost empty at lunchtime on a saturday, go figure)\n*They have cotton candy"
0,Would give a -star if possible. The woman that works here does not know how to read or treat first time customers with any respect. Did not get to try the over priced food. The door says open till 9 pm but tonight she was closing at 6:45pm. WTH
3,"We've been in three times for lunch in the past month and ordered the same thing each time. The sweet and spicy edamame is amazing!  We've also ordered the Caterpillar and Capt Crunch, both wonderful!  While we did not order alcoholic beverages with our lunch, their iced green tea is refreshing. Friendly server remembered us when we came back the second and third time. \n\nPrices are reasonable and we will for sure keep going back to help keep this neighborhood joint in business...it's been 4 different restaurant in the last 12 years.\n\nRarely give out 5 stars as there is always room for improvement but consider this a 4.5 review."
0,"I'm so glad this place decided to treat my friends and I like scum, I love that! \n\n-Waiting 20 minutes for simple food? Check!\n-20 minute wait for any type of communication from the waitress? Check!\n-Attitude from said waitress? Check!\n-Giving us the bullshit fake line about the Credit Card minimum? DOUBLE CHECK!\n\nThis was basically the visit from hell and assured that our weekly happy hour meetups will no longer be taking place here. Congrats Kerry's! You have lost yourself steady business."
4,"Best pizza this side of Brooklyn!!!  We love the NY Round but the square pie is also excellent. Great atmosphere, clean, and friendly excellent service. The calamari was tender and flavorful.  Definitely our favorite restaurant in Vegas."
3,"Yeah 3 1/2 \u00e9toiles! C'est un peu un pot-pourris comme resto asiatique. On y sert les classiques mais aussi du Ph\u00f4, du General Tao, des nouilles, etc..Vraiment beau bon pas cher. J'ai bien aim\u00e9 mon pho aka Soupe Tonkinoise sur le menu au boeuf et tendons. Pas exceptionnel mais pour 9,00, vraiment pas mal du tout.  Rien de wow compar\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto ou certains autres endroits de Montr\u00e9al mais vraiment potable."
4,Came here to eat on a random day I had sushi and my gf had a salad. The sushi was great and my gf really liked her salad plus the service was very good. This location is new ans the inside of the restaurant is amazing.
4,"The staff here are extremely personable and friendly. The room was big enough to accommodate my 7 family members and was really comfortable. The goodie bag was filled with lots of great stuff too! Overall, we were extremely pleased with our experience and recommend it to anyone looking for a great ultrasound place!"
0,"Getting worse and worse. Has definitely changed in quality and personality since last year. We were so excited about this place when it first opened. Blackened Tilapia Caesar salad was one we craved. We loved the man that was there too, I think he was/is the owner.  We haven't seen him in months and the staff has seemed to change.  Not only has the waitstaff got to (BLEEP) but the food too.  The blackened tilapia is no where near as delicious as it was before and there is some funky too sweet for a caesar salad going on. I could probably go on and on about our waitress who didn't seem to have much screws tight in her head at all.  How about be happy about your job or dont rub your bad day on us.  If you have nothing to do all day and want to wait on your waitress, go here. If you have a life and dont want to waist hours on hours then definitely do not go here.\n\nRevo Burrito down Camelback is WAY BETTER than this place"
1,"They really focous on the grill part. The meul is full of griled chicken, meat and a fish item. There also are pizzas and pastas.\n\nMy main grip with this place i having highly adulterated dishes, go to italy and fettuccine Alfredo means, noodles and sauce, no chicken. The theme is carries out thought the menu, in a poor attempt to seem original lobster, sausage or chicken is added to most traditional dishes.\n\nThis left me a vegetarian with only a few choices, I went with the Grilled salmon (no sauce) with the garlic mashed potato. The salmon was a  standard farm raised variety and typically over cooked for my tastes. The potatoes were decent as enough garlic and butter can make anything good. ($17)\n\nI did like the bread here but that is not enough of a reason to get me back. A long wait for mediocre Salmon at a less than stellar price."
4,Great place! My spray tans have always turned out even and the color is natural looking.
4,"I am such a sucker for this place.  Don't let my check-in count fool you -- I used to be here at least once a week, usually more.  I just didn't have the Yelp app (shame on me).\n\nOld Navy, H&M, Sephora, Juicy Couture, MAC, Victoria's Secret, Teavana... oh man, the reasons to hang out at this place for hours at a time.\n\nYardhouse is a great little spot to eat and drink, the movie theater is now owned by AMC I believe (I hated Rave, so this is a huge bonus), Kabuki serves up some stellar sushi and there is even a little boba tea place tucked away by the bridge in the middle.\n\nThe atmosphere here is always happy and energetic, so sometimes I just like to walk around aimlessly and soak that in.  Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf can assist in your caffeinated fix to do so, too!\n\nThey hold several events here throughout the year; I've been to a few and they really give a sense of community.\n\nI almost always make my out-of-town friends come here because damnit, it's awesome.\n\nTalking about it makes me want to go...but I certainly know better to NOT go on Christmas Eve...ha!"
4,Went here twice for breakfast -- huge variety and quite tasty!  Almost all buffets I've been to have bland and boring food since they have to mass produce the dishes.  This one was delicious!  Highly recommend!
3,Personally I love this place ! The pizza is actually good ! The 18' pizza which is HUGE is a decent price in my opinion ! The staff is very friendly and they are close with each other ! There very organized and the environment is very cozy ! I have been going here since they opened and there hasn't been one time where I had horrible experience !
0,"Please don't waste your time or money!  Absolutely horrible, it taste as bad as the building looks! HORRIBLE SERVICE TOO!"
0,Way overrated! Other than the raw oysters and stone crab everything is pretty salty and normal. \nSave the $63 and go to wicked!
0,"All I could keep thinking about was Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares-- It's a nice enough looking restaurant inside...but on a Saturday night, the restaurant was 1/2 full--\n\nMany of the previous comments have hit the nail on the head-- uninspired entrees-- Mac & Cheese shows up twice on menu as an entree and as an appetizer size-- mixed with lump crab your'd expect a nice dish-- It was bland penne paste with an alfredo sauce and parmesan cheese baked on top--- I have made better mac & cheese at home--\n\nA friend ordered \""fall off the bone\"" ribs....not exactly falling off the bone.\n\nFood needs a \""Kitchen Nightmares\""  makeover....or Regions will be history"
0,"It's a dump, but I've done so many bad reviews of this place on so many other sites that I don't have the passion to rant about it anymore. \n\nI will say this though: If you want to be stuck at the very south end of the strip, in an ugly casio with idiots and thier ill-mannered kids, have a crappy room and experience terrible customer service, then by all means, book at stay here. \n\nDon't say I didn't warn you."
0,"I totally agree with Brandon's review. The place does like nicer than other Korean buffets because it's brand new. As for the food and service it was not so nice. All the marinated meat was overly sweet, after having a few pieces you just had enough of the same taste. The cooked stuff does look and taste a bit old as if cooked a head of time or maybe a day in advance. Had the fried rice and chow mein noodles and they were dried and chewy. As for the service they were super attentive to begin with maybe because the dinner crowd hasn't arrived. The staff kept coming to our table every 5 minutes to ask if everything ok, if we needed more drinks and helped us clean the non-stick cook top but after 30min. into the meal and the crowd started piling in it was hard to flag them down for service. I feel sorry for the waitress having to service so many tables but they give their patrons a false sense of good service when they cannot maintain it. We were perrie dogging at our table trying to flag down any waitress that walked by but they were too busy to look around. The owner notice us but he just stood there at the cashier and brought us the check and we weren't even finished with our meal. The (old Korean lady/owner) was such a phony... she'll walk by your table as ask if everything is okay while she's continuing to walk so by the time you want to comment on something she's like already 3 booths down. And on top of that I had a really bad tummy ache right after and I hate to mention this in the comment because it makes it seem like I'm  really dis-crediting the restaurant but for the sake of my fellow yelpers. I hope you won't have a bad case of you know what because I have warned you. I don't think I will come back. No thank you!"
2,"I heard about Cabo Fish Taco from a friend who lives in the NoDa area. I was so excited because I absolutely love fish tacos. The first time I visited, I ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and the Cabo Fish Taco. The ingredients were fresh and the tortilla was delicious but there was nothing spectacular about the flavor profiles. I visited a second time and ordered the same dish to give it another shot and I was again left wanting more. The side dishes also leave something to be desired. I would be willing to visit again and try something new but definitely no time soon. It is also incredibly loud which is somewhat of a downer if you want to actually talk to your dinner companions."
4,Best choice of ingredients and selection of toppings I've seen in a pizza joint. Spotted goat is great but what's really great about this place is a vegan actually has options on this menu.
3,"This is the one mall out here that I like. Its got a lot of the stores that I frequent (Sephora, VS, Banana Republic, Forever 21, Body Shop etc.), and a movie theater. They have misters in the summer, since its an outdoor mall. \n\nParking is pretty hassle free. The only thing I don't like is how In and Out is across the street. I guess its not upscale enough to hang with the other food establishments on this side of the street or something stupid like that."
0,"NEVER AGAIN!\n\nTook 1 of my cars here to get the annual state inspection.  Told the guy behind the counter that I know it is a very old car, probably a lot could be done on it, but the KBB is just over a $1,000, and that I did not use it very much at all.  Just wanted it to pass inspection so I could keep it and use it to haul stuff.  After about an hour wait, he came back and said if failed inspection and he had 3 sheets of print outs of what needed to be done.  I confirmed with him that everything on the print out needed to be done in order to pass inspection.  He confirmed and I told him I was going to decline as I knew it wouldn't be cheap.  A neighbor recommended I try his place, so I went there, told them my situation and left him my car.  He called the next day and told me it needed $16 worth of parts in order to pass.  All told, it cost me $60 to pass inspection.\n\nI then went back to AAA on Independence and asked them for an estimate on my work order.  Total estimate was right around $1,100.  I, once again confirmed with him that it was all necessary in order to pass inspection.\n\nIn the politest way I could, I told him my situation and that I was showed him the Passed certificate for the inspection and that it only cost $60.  He gave me some typical responses as I knew he / they would:\n -  \""We at AAA really don't like to do State Inspections.  We know that other repair shops see the inspections as 'cash-cows'\""\n-   \""There is a lot of 'grey areas' when it comes to the inspections\""\n\nI was ok with everything that he said until he looked at the date of my visit and said \""I wasn't here that day, otherwise I could have worked with the inspector to see about 'just getting it passed'\"".  Problem:  he was there that day, b/c I asked him a question about the other car that my wife brought in to get inspected!"
4,"Le McKibbin's Irish Pub est sp\u00e9cial pour moi. Situ\u00e9 \u00e0 un coin de rue de mon boulot, il arrive r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement que j'y fasse un tour en finissant de travailler.\n\nParlons tout d'abord du b\u00e2timent. \u00c0 lui seul, il vaut le d\u00e9tour. \u00c0 sa vue, nous ne pouvons qu'\u00eatre charm\u00e9s. Une magnifique maison traditionnelle que l'on imagine sans peine dans un petit village Irlandais.\n\nLe sous-sol est utilis\u00e9 en tant que restaurant, qui vaut aussi le d\u00e9tour, particuli\u00e8rement pour leur fameux Fish & Chips. C'est cependant l'\u00e9tage principal qui nous int\u00e9resse. En passant la premi\u00e8re porte un \u00e9criteau nous accueille en nous signalant que la bi\u00e8re est tellement plus qu'un d\u00e9jeuner. On passe une seconde porte et on entre dans le bar.\n\nQuel endroit magnifique. Tout en bois avec des citations et des plaques de l'Irlande, quelques publicit\u00e9s de bi\u00e8res, Irlandaise, il va sans dire, mais surtout la ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nale quantit\u00e9 d'alcools, pour tous les go\u00fbts, derri\u00e8re le bar. Les serveuses sont sympathiques, les prix plus que raisonnables et l'ambiance magique. Apr\u00e8s deux minutes, le sentiment de d\u00e9paysement est complet. Ce n'est plus qu'un bar \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, c'est un voyage en Irlande. \n\nEn v\u00e9rifiant leur site web, vous pouvez choisir vos heures de visites en fonction de la pr\u00e9sence de musiciens. Il va sans dire que c'est une excellente id\u00e9e de planifier ainsi sa visite. Je n'ai jamais \u00e9cout\u00e9 de mauvais musicien sur place et ceux-ci nous abreuvent de chansons rock traditionnelles brass\u00e9es \u00e0 la sauce Irlandaise. \n\nJe ne sais que dire de plus. Ce Pub est unique et il vaut la peine d'\u00eatre visit\u00e9 dans les meilleures conditions possibles au moins une fois."
2,"The Mac Shack has a menu that lets you have countless combos of pasta, sauces, meats, and veggies as well as regular menu items that they came up with. It's not fast food but you don't have to wait long for you order. They even bring it to the table for ya! \n\nI had the Crazy Alfredo. It had one jumbo shrimp, chicken, bell peppers, mushrooms and jalapenos. I opted to add roasted garlic for 50 cents more. All of the dishes come on a biodegradable plates made from banana leaves. I thought that was a nice touch being the eco-friendly person I am.  Every thing is prepared fresh when you order it. The kitchen is open for all to see whet the cook is doing.\nMy main gripe and the reason for only 3 stars is the cost to portion ratio. I could have eaten 2 meals but I really didn't want to take out a loan for it. The total bill for two people with two drinks was like 25 bucks. I never understood why pasta places charge so much for so little. But I don't run the store so I have no clue what the operating costs are.\n\nI recommend every one tries it at least once. I'll go back but I think it's a bit pricey for me to be a regular"
0,"Other then the milkshakes, there is nothing about Burger Bar that would make me want to go back.  Service was pathetic, we waited 15 mins just to get drinks and place our order. The food was nothing special. Aside from a variety of toppings to choose from, I've had better burgers from Five Guys. Even worse then the experience we had at lunch, my husband got sick and spent the remainder of the day and night running back and forth to the bathroom to rid himself of his lunch.\n\nSave your money and go elsewhere."
1,"These guys don't seem to be able to keep staff or standards consistently. When we walked in, the young lady behind the counter just looked at us and didn't say a word. She just continued shuffling bagels from one spot in the display case to another. After a couple of minutes, the only young man there, finished texting on his cell phone and came over to ask what we wanted. The food was not bad, just average for any Einstein location and our order was correct. The restaurant itself was in bad need of cleaning, despite there being only four customers there in addition to us. There were dirty tables, dirty floors and when I went to the restroom, I wanted to puke it was so disgusting. I think we are done here. (See Photos)"
0,"BAD. AWFUL. THE WORST.\n\nOne of the worst dining experiences of my life that I keep trying to forget, but I just can't. And I have to share my experience so that some other well-meaning tourist does NOT give this place a try. \n\nIn February, my man and I were visiting his family in the area. We drove to hike at the mountains, but ended up stopping for lunch instead. Our party of 5 arrived at 12:30 on a Sunday. When we asked if they were still open, the waiter replied, \""I guess you'll be the last table\"". Umm, your hours say that you are open until 2pm on Sundays. In this economy, I don't think it's smart to turn business away, but maybe that's just me. This was the first sign of a problem and we should have walked out, but I try to be agreeable and go with the group. It was one awful thing after another: the waiter argued with our drink orders after we told him he brought the wrong thing, it took over 30 minutes to bring our chips & salsa for appetizers and the portions were insanely small. If chips and salsa cost money, you can at least give me more than 25 chips! An hour (yes, 1 hour) after ordering, the food came out 1 dish at a time. The veggie burger was just as ordered and bowl of soup was fine. The sandwich my boyfriend's nephew ordered was with the wrong meat and cheese. We heard a whole bunch of yelling with curse words and couldn't tell where it was coming from, but quickly realized that it was the cook in the kitchen. The cook seemed to be pissed off at what we ordered and didn't want to make it. My chicken sandwich came out next.  I cut it in half to discover that the CHICKEN WAS NOT FULLY COOKED. Seriously disgusting. My boyfriend's trio of \""sliders\"" came out on 3 plates with the beef, pork and other meats partially charred (not in a good way) and the bread haphazardly thrown on top. I don't think it was supposed to be \""build it yourself\"". We heard more yelling from the cook and then heard, \""I'm f***ing done with this place\"" as the cook threw off their apron and stormed out. The waiter was clearly ashamed  and apologized for the cook. After some convincing, he reluctantly removed the chicken sandwich and sliders from our bill and we tried to leave as quickly as possible.\n\nOnce again, I would like to say that I hate writing bad reviews.... But if I had read a review similar to mine, we would have never come to this horrible place to \""piss off\"" the cook so much. Lesson learned!\n\nNote to the staff: It would be better to turn business away than give your patrons horrible service and be pissed off yourselves as well."
4,"Marcellino Ristorante is a truly excellent Italian restaurant. There are many options especially in Scottsdale for fine dining, especially if one craves Italian cuisine. However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant."
3,"Brightly painted in reds and yellows this not your typical optometrists office. There is no corporate feeling here. I'd like to think its hip and chic especially when it comes to us four-eyes. \nThe front desk staff (Jaime and Denise) are awesome. You don't have to worry about that cold \""sit down and wait for your doctor to see you\"" attitude you normally get going to any physician or specialist. \nI'd recommend letting them help you pick out the type of frames that work for you. I told Denise that I didn't like metal or rim less frames and that I only wanted plastic frames that were square. Within about 5 minutes I had an awesome selection to choose from. She did try to sell me on some goofy looking Ray Bans but clearly I'm not a Ray Ban kind of girl. With my glasses picked out (black pair of Candies and some really fun all white ones) I was ready to make my appointment.\nIf you're shopping around for a good optometrist Dr Burke is super awesome and extremely friendly by the way!"
4,"My first time paint balling, OMG i am such a FAN.  I think its like $25 or $26 for 500 paint pellets, Girls get FREE protective gear. (Girls have to their \""girls\"")  Before you walk to the back area where the 2-fields are located you are provided w/ safety and instructions of paint balling.  \n\nOnce behind the doors, there's a sitting area where you gear up and practice shooting your gun.  It's a warehouse w/ two separate rooms, all the staff was super helpful and the regulars even let us jump in on some of their practice runs. \n\nOUCH! indeed, those paint balls hurt like a MUG, we were bruised for about 2wks.  Even with the bruise, I will be back. Call me crazy, but this is a good place for a a 1st date hahahhaahaa\n\n\nbut, this is only my opinion, try it out for yourself and form your own opinion of Bonehead Paintball"
2,"I dropped a few weeks ago, early on a Saturday evening and split prior to the place going all W/S disco (WESSSIDE!). The place certainly lacks charm, to say the least. You can tell that the daytime hours are just filler before the meat market, ho's/bro's auction begins. \n\nWhat I can say is that the food was surprisingly good. Just the typical bar fare but everything was super tasty; burgers, fries, mozzarella sticks, wings etc. were all great. They have no beer on tap but a decent selection of domestic, micro and import bottles. The service was very good as well. Can't say I'll be rushing to return, but I'd meet up for lunch at someones request just for the food."
3,"Von au\u00dfen wirkt das Caf\u00e9 Journal doch recht unscheinbar, bietet dann aber doch mehr Platz als man glaubt. Zu gewissen Zeiten sollte man aber dennoch zeitig kommen, um einen der begehrten Pl\u00e4tze ergattern zu k\u00f6nnen, denn das Cafe Journal ist eine Premiere Sports Bar und zu Bundesliga-Sendezeiten ist das Cafe schon recht voll besonders wenn der KSC spielt. Leider wird dann auf die Konferenzschaltung verzichtet und nur der KSC gezeigt, was mich als Nicht-KSCler doch sehr st\u00f6rt. Fu\u00dfball schaut man entweder auf der gro\u00dfen Leinwand oder den beiden Gr\u00dfbild-Fernsehern.\nDie Auswahl an Speisen und Getr\u00e4nken ist relativ hoch und die Speisen sind auch sehr lecker und sie sind reichlich und machen satt, auch zu einem angenehmen Preis. Man beachte aber, dass nicht immer alle Speisen verf\u00fcgbar sind.\nDie Toiletten haben ihre besten Zeiten sicherlich hinter sich, aber man ist ja nicht daheim bei Mutti. Hauptsache ist, dass es sauber ist. Die Kneipe an sich ist recht gem\u00fctlich, aber verdient eher den Titel eine Kneipe als eines Caf\u00e9s. Ich l\u00fcmmle mich in der Regel am Tresen. Die Kneipe hat keinen Raucherraum und so m\u00fcssen die Raucher raus auf den Geh weg. Nachteilig ist dies, weil sie die Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger behindern und es ein st\u00e4ndiges rein und raus gibt."
2,"My husband and I headed here for a night out with a group called EVFN.  I love casual restaurants but I just was not overly impressed with this one.  The place was \""fine\"" but just not amazing.\n\nWe had wings (HUGE WINGS) and fried mushrooms.  The wings were fine...not amazing but not horrible.  We ordered hot barbecue and hot teriyaki but neither one of them were at all spicy...and the mushrooms were just okay.  \n\nThe service was good (she had, like, fourteen separate checks!) and the beer selection was awesome."
3,"Durants is a great option for a nice dinner or to celebrate a special occasion. I have to say that I enjoyed the look and vibe of this old school, romantic, mobster-ish joint a tad more than I enjoyed the actual food.  Had to go with the prime rib, which was good and large so come with an appetite!  You definitely want to make a reservation but luckily I was able to get in same day (during spring training) So that was much appreciated. \n\nTip-have a martini!"
1,"Soo.... where do you go for break up eating ... anywhere with PIE. \nMy friend Susan and I , had gone to see Le Reve and after we were a little hungry.  We stopped in at Marie Callendars (see aforementioned break up eating for PIE) \nI was a little concerned about the funky smell when we entered the door ... it smelled like a backed up sewer or grease trap that was over full... (bleh)\nI ordered the Cheesy Potato Soup so that PIE would not be a big deal . \nI ordered an Ice tea to drink which our waitress.. whom I do not know her real name ... but she should really find another job because... really... I would have rather had someone who enjoyed their job serving me. \nShe seemed offended that we needed extra time for decisions and drinks took forever.  NO REFILLS ... she didn't even check ... (WTH)\nI was furious! \nI had to ASK for glass of water since she wouldn't refill my tea.  (grrr)\nThe soup... was ok.. \nThe pie was ... ok .. .but I think I should have ordered chocolate not strawberry. \nTotally disappointed as break-up pie was needed. This is what girls go and do when they are sad... and it only made me sadder (lol)\nI don't think this is Marie Callendars as a whole.. but this location ... for sucked!\nWill not be back to this location at all.. the waitress REALLY left me feeling like I was not valued as a customer. \nshe must not value tips either.\nok enough about the waitress.... \nthe only other thing I noticed is that Marie Callendars has cut their menu down ALOT.  The pie selection is not as great as it was.. and I think that if I am going for pie ... I will go to CoCo's next time."

2,"Food is meh, especially compared to stars like Culinary Dropout (this may be the weak link the Fox chain). Plentiful outdoor seating is nice, but this meal left something to be desired."
3,Why is oxtail one word? That's something I'd like to know. But the only thing you need to know: Market Street Cafe has absolutely the best Oxtail Soup I've ever had. There's a reason the lines are pretty much always out the door at this place. Slow service? Possibly. Amazing Oxtail Soup? Most definitely.
4,"It is not easy to find a vet who handles reptiles and is available. I have a Jackson's chameleon with a lip infection. I arrived early in the morning and my chameleon was checked out and treated within an hour - without an appointment. Now, that's what I call excellent service! Dr. Snead knew what he was doing and the front staff was friendly and helpful. Thank you Camino Al Norte Animal Hospital!"
4,"I am a recent Food City convert. I used to only go when I needed hominy in bulk and couldn't find it in the grocery store. I now shop here on a much more regular basis for 2 reasons.\n\n1. Cheap ass produce. Seriously 8 cucumbers for $1 and 3 pounds of roma tomatoes for $1. Ridiculous. Food City has 80% cheaper produce than any other grocery stores in the state.\n\n2. Cheap ass spices - I recently made Puerco pibil and needed Anchiote, I found it for $2 in a small bag. The only other store I found that carried it was charging over $12, no lie.\n\nSo I can't vouch for the rest of the store, but if you need spices or produce the is THE SPOT!"
0,"WOW!!! Review pending. Go anywhere other then this 'Hospital'\nMy husband and I decided that he needed to go to the ER to get assessed because he woke up in the morning with these large bumps on both of his legs just beneath his knees. His legs swollen, tender, and very red and hot to the touch. He began to develop raised bumps on his chest, back, and arms. It seemed to progress pretty quickly. My husband never complains about anything and absolutely avoids Dr's and would never dream of an ER visit unless he thought something was seriously wrong. I am a Registered Nurse and specialize in med/surg and after monitoring him throughout the day we decided to go down and be seen. I'm not positive but I thought it may be Erythema Nodosum, but I cannot diagnose of course, that would be up to the Dr. \nHe checked in and was triaged very quick and then brought back to one of the beds. A male nurse came inland asked what was going on and we explained his signs and symptoms and gave a detailed report over the last 24 hours. The nurse was not paying attention at all while we talking. He did not do anything other then a quick glance and then exited the room. \nNext the Dr came in and paid even less attention then  the nurse. Now the Dr just stood for a minute and she did not assess my husband or even slightly exam the affected areas. Now my husband had flu like symptoms over the last few weeks and had generalized fatigue. The Dr did not ask for any history, did not do an exam, and turned and left the room without saying one thing to us or even give us an opinion as to what it could be.\nI never mention that I'm a nurse when I go to the Dr or clinc or wherever  as that could work against us.Wells a few minutes later the nurse came back in with discharge papers and an Rx for two antibiotics ( Keflex and Bactrim) as well as a oral prednisone.  No information, no exam, no review of history of other acute symptoms and he was handed his paperwork and said we could go. My husband was so mad because he was given no information and no medical advise at all. We asked the RN if we really were being released and the nurse said \""what would you like us to do\"" Nice bedside manner you uncaring idiot. \nWe left, husband very upset and \"" we need your $125.00 co-pay\""\nEven if it was something minor we should have at least been educated and given a rational for the antibiotics Now anyone in the medical field with direct patient care knows how important education is. Had we been just two people  with no medical back ground, we should have at least been informed on the importance of taking the antibiotics as prescribed, even when you are feeling better. Wow! Medication such as antibiotics have to be completed properly and many patients do not know this. So much for quality care and we will never use this \""hospital\"" again. \nAbsolutely horrible service and care. \nHopes this helps even one person if they have a choice where to receive care."
2,I recommend the garlic chicken sandwich.
4,"It's been a while since I last Yelped.\n\nIt's not for lack of trying, it's just that .... well, none of the new places that I have tried out have really moved me enough to even bother to click a few buttons to give a mediocre rating to.  Yeah, it's been that kind of a ride for me the past few months.\n\nBut, like all slumps, this one had to end and boy, what a slump breaker it was!  Creamed spinach in my teeth, BBQ sauce all over my face and my hands smelling like I had been tending a bonfire all night.  It. was.GLORIOUS.\n\nHere's the breakdown: (what we ordered tonight)\n\nMe - Beef Trio (2 Beef Ribs, Brisket and Tri-Tip)  The brisket and tri-tip were both very tender, very juicy and practically melted in my mouth.  There was even a moment when I had a slice of brisket at the end of my fork and I was trying to pick up some of the dry rub off one of my ribs with it and it practically disintegrated.  It was THAT tender, yet very lean and not fatty at all.  \n\nCreamed Spinach - You can tell that it's made fresh, not thawed out from a frozen glob.  My wife hates cooked spinach, but she LOVED the creamed spinach here.  It had a homemade/handmade quality to it along with everything else.  I don't know how to describe it other than \""Down-Home Gourmet\"" \n\nGarlic Mashed Potatoes - Very VERY flavorful the whole way through.  You can also tell that it's hand-made, not powdered, with skins and all, just the way I like it.  BONUS!\n\nSweet Potato Fries - With Honey and Cinnamon! it's almost a dessert! This is the only place I have found here in Las Vegas where the sweet potato fries are crispy and not soggy, definitely one of my favorites. BONUS +2\n\nSweet Tea - One of the staples (Brisket is the other) that I HAVE TO try out at every new BBQ joint and weighs very heavily in my final tally of how a restaurant ranks because I down these suckers non-stop and Adam's did not disappoint.  It may be a little too sweet for others, but it's exactly how I like it, with a noticeable taste of brown sugar to it.  Another Bonus, these guys are just hitting me right where I live.\n\nPulled Pork Sandwich - (According to the wife) \""It wasn't greasy or fatty, it was just pure tender, juicy meat with a nice soft bun\""\n\nWe actually got a chance to speak with the Owner, Adam (Who also owns the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy) and he was very friendly and informative.  He introduced us to their various sauces and their incredible dry rub.  The regular sauce was a little too sweet for me, but then again, I never do regular sauces and always go for the hot stuff.  Their hot variant \""The Slow Burn\"" is not an in-your-face kick you in the teeth super-hot insanity sauce.  Think of it more as a fine Sake`, deep subtle flavor (Very flavorful) with a slow burn that gradually builds at the back of your throat and catches you unawares, kind'a like the way good Sake` creeps up on you and then BAM all of a sudden, you're drunk.\n\nThe Dry Rub though, was definitely the star of the various condiments.  According to Adam, it is salt free (I believe he also said that they try to use as little salt, if any, in all of their dishes) so you can pile it on as much as you want and not feel guilty about your sodium intake.  The flavor just made my mouth water even more  it was so subtle, yet complex.  It was the perfect complement to the Brisket and tri-tip.\n\nLook, I can just keep going on and on until my fingers get worn down to nubs, but here's the skinny.  I like me some BBQ and I definitely LOVE me some beef ribs, DRY (No sauce) Since that's the way to really tell how good a restaurant's dry rub is.  Lucille's Smokehouse taught me that and that's how I've been judging my ribs ever since, by how they compare to Lucille's and I'll be brutally honest, I like Adam's ribs better than any other BBQ place that I have tried in town, yes, even Lucille's and CJ's.  Everything we tried just tasted home-made  and not like it came off an assembly line.  These guys put a lot of love into their cooking and it shows.  Just give them one chance, you may just find yourself a new favorite BBQ place like I did."
3,Good food Good prices and Good crowd. Will be going there again soon.
0,"False advertising!!! RUN!!!\nI'm not a cheap person.. \nBut when you advertise something to a customer I believe you must be truthful about the product/service you offer... \n\nThe advertising stated $20 but it was really $35/hour \n(I normally go to Bali Foot spa I pay 20$/hour for a full body massage) \nBut I wanted to try a new place out... \n\nThe massage lasted 48 minutes not 60 minutes...\n\nThey were:\nText messaging while they were giving us massages... \nAnd her phone would go off every other minute \""Bing..

Not a really big thing...)\n\nAnd when it came to payment I told them to charge the credit card 45$ even. They we bargaining to add more tip! They didn't swipe the card till I told them \""You choose 35$ or 45$?!?!\"" \nI believe that I offered them a generous tip even though the service was not so great... \nAnd you try to hustle more money out of me? \n\nThat was just ridiculous! \n\nI left the place more stressed than when I came in...\n\nNever going back to this place.\n\nThe only positive thing about is: It's clean and they offered water / hot tea...."
2,This place was ok.  I'm not going to say I'm a huge fan nor am I not a fan either.  If I didn't want to walk further down or up the strip I'd eat here again.  There is a good variety and well very decent place to kill any hangover too :-)
2,"Currently I am on a diet called the Paleo diet or in simple terms the caveman diet. While trying to order my strange burrito bowl without beans and rice the person who made my burrito bowl was pretty disrespectful.\n\nAsking for half chicken and half pork he placed just a smidgeon of both meats into the empty bowl and just said okay is that all you want? After having another employee chime in by saying that's clearly not enough, i had to ask for more meat without stressing the option of paying extra.\n\nOverall I'm pretty sure the employee is only used to the average status quo of a burrito. I enjoy Chipotle but probably wont come back to this one."
4,"My wife and I had been racking our brains to try and figure out a good activity in which our three year old daughter could get involved.  We thought about dance. We contemplated martial arts. We couldn't decide on either. \n\nSo, instead, we picked both! \n\nWe searched the internet for different capoeira locations. Most of the sites said that the activity was more suited for children four and up. Capoeira Brasil said that children would be taken on a case by case basis. So, we decided to see if our daughter was up to the task. \n\nThe first instructor we met was Mr. Fogo. He was very patient with Mackenzie. He put her through some basic moves, stretches, etc. Mackenzie LOVED it!\n\nUltimately, they said that she could keep coming back for classes if she wanted to. They also mentioned that they were just really restarting the children's program. So, for a few months, it was one-on-one instruction. What a fantastic learning opportunity!\n\nIt has been 6 months since we starded bringing Mac to capoeira classes. She has shown amazing improvement thanks to the wonderful instructors at the school. \n\nMy wife and I are confident that we have begun our daughter down the pathway to a healthy and exciting life because of her instruction at Capoeira Brasil Tempe!"
1,"It is more expensive than the cheap London Chinese buffets, so I expected a bit better quality. Alas, the food was of the low quality greasy fried \""Chinese\"" (none of my Chinese friends cook like that) that you expect to find in the cheapest places. At least the place looks good, is spacious and there is all you can eat ice cream! Not particularly good ice cream, but all-you-can-eat ice cream does count for something.\nI had quickly read some good reviews on my phone, while walking by it and decided to go in, but it seems a lot of people have no idea what a decent Chinese buffet is like. No, it should not be just deep-fried stuff."
0,"I will NEVER  return to The Golden Steer.  \n \nI am a local resident, and had visited The Golden Steer only one time before, many years ago.  After my first visit I was convinced that I had eaten at one of the finest restaurants in the world.  The food, the ambiance, and the service were impeccable.  Could it be that when Thomas Wolf wrote 'You Can't Go Home Again' he was referring to restaurants, as well?\n \nOn Tuesday evening, December 20, I revisited The Golden Steer with my partner.    The ambiance on my first visit had been that of a Fine Steak House, elegant and tasteful.  On the Tuesday that we visited it was more akin to a Denny's in a depressed area.  Even though the room was nearly empty, we were seated next to a large corner booth occupied by what was obviously a family.  That would not have been a problem, except that shortly after our seating a young girl, about 5 or 6 years old, began singing the one partial verse of Jingle Bells that she knew - over and over.  Again, not so bad - until she started jumping up and down in the seat.  Then a \""Hostess' or some female employee came over to their booth and encouraged the little girl to keep it up, sing louder; and even joined in with her for a few more rounds of the same 8 - 10 words that she knew.  I could have asked to be reseated, but I let it go.  It was the Christmas Season, after all.\n \nMy guest ordered a dinner salad without tomatoes.   They seemed to take forever to arrive.   They finally arrived via table side cart.  They were finished and placed on the table.  There were tomatoes on both salads.  We told the server, and he took the incorrect salad away on the cart.  Nearly 10 minutes later he returned with the salad plate in his hand, and plopped it down, very unceremoniously, in front of my guest.\n \nThe entrees arrived.  I had ordered Prime Rib of Beef (36 oz), baked potato, and creamed corn.  My guest had the Top Sirloin, steak fries and broccoli.  We both asked for our entree to be cooked the same way; medium to medium well.   My prime rib was overcooked - to the point of being DRY.  Fortunately, the au jus was there to make it palatable.\n \nMy partner's steak was closer to cremated.   There wasn't even a tinge of pink to be found in that steak.  We have both had meat that was a little too done on the outside edges, only to have it turn out to be fine as we got closer to the center.  We both kept eating, hoping for a tasty outcome.  Unfortunately, that was not the case that night.  \n \nAfter reaching the center of the dry, tough steak, the waiter finally wandered by.  We pointed out how overcooked the meat was.   He made a production of inspecting every aspect of the half eaten steak, flashlight and all, trying desperately to find even a speck of pink.  Unable to do so, he offered to replace it, although he felt it necessary to point out that nearly half of the meat had already been eaten.  We declined his embarrassingly disingenuous offer.  He left, returning a few minutes later to say that he had spoken to the management who had graciously taken half the price of the steak off of our bill.\n \nNothing was right that night.  The corn was way too sweet.  The baked potato, while big,  was absolutely unfit to serve.  Nearly black on the bottom, it had about one half inch of dark brown, scorched flesh on the inside.  Fortunately, it was large enough that I could salvage some edible parts from the top half.  The broccoli was the opposite, both undercooked (to the point of being hard)  and COLD.  A dab of butter put on top in an attempt to make it palatable,  just sat there, unmelted, throughout the meal.\n \nWe asked to have the remainder of our meals wrapped to go.  I specifically mentioned wanting the au jus for my prime rib, since it was inedible without it.  I was absolutely stunned and actually embarrassed when they brought out our take home package.  Cheap Styrofoam clam-shells in a generic plastic bag!  Even Denny's has more class than to present their guests with such a cheap, inelegant farewell.  When I got home I found that the waiter had forgotten (?) to include the au jus.  My dogs appreciated The Golden Steer.  That night, they ate prime rib for the first time in their lives.\n \nThe prices were very high, on par with what one would expect from a steakhouse that actually serves good food.  The service was poor, and any sign of ambiance must have fled after Sinatra's last visit.  This is NOT \""Old School Vegas\"".  This is just an establishment that  'jumped the shark' many years ago."
4,"Gambling on the strip without the pretension? Yes, it can be done..O'Sheas is basically a dive bar casino, so right up my alley. $5 tables for those who play lower black jack tables and $50 tables for those who like to gamble a little more.  Beer is ice cold and cheap, they have beer pong which I thought was a bit interesting, but brought me back to college for a minute. Love this place though"
1,I was very disappointed! It's not reasonable in price for what they give you. The portions are small and I couldn't even see the meat in my taquitos. I think business would be much better if they went down on their prices and gave you more. For what I spent there I could of spent less somewhere else and got way more food for my money.
0,Came on a Saturday afternoon. 1:40p... it took them over 45 mins to get my cold soba and salmon sashimi dish. . Im still here waiting and at this point I don't think I will come back.  Slow service
0,The cashier asked me if I wanted my receipt for my credit card purchase. Duh! Yeah! Went there last night and ordered a take-out X-Large MegaMeat. Got home and it was on thick crust which I didn't order or like. The pizza was super dry with minimal sauce and cheese. It was awful. Oh how I wish RoundTable Pizza was in Mesa.
4,"I've been going to this place with my friends before school and we absolutely love it! It's a small, family owned business that's a little far away from my school, but the donuts are high quality and for good prices. My friends always get the donut holes, which are really cheap. I also really like their giant donuts and their croissants!"
3,Good stuff! but they need a better A/C system. We went in there during the summer and it was uncomfortable.
0,"You may be familiar with the term food porn. That's when your little buddies post pictures of restaurant dishes on Facebook. Food at the Sao Paulo cafe at the Rio definitely falls into the snuff porn category.\n\nNone of my friends were able to finish the food, because it was so horrible. We only ate there, because we had a conference meeting in the hotel and no time to look for food outside."
1,"This place is just down the street from my house, so we finally made our way over here to check it out, as my partner and I both love a good brunch.\n\nI don't think either of us will be back. The wait was only a couple in front of us, but took almost 25 minutes to be seated, and the way the restaurant was laid out, we had to basically stand in front of the door while waiting.  Also, I had to chase down the waiter to even get on the wait list.\n\nOnce seated, I opened the menu, ready to get the black bean burger I'd seen online...their only non-egg vegetarian item.  I had purposely scouted the menu online before coming in, since they didn't seem super veg friendly.\n\nYeah. Apparently, they no longer serve veggie burgers. Nope.  So when I asked our server, as a vegetarian, what I could get, she told me there was some sort of dish that one of the servers made with cottage cheese, mushrooms and avocado.  I had no option but to ask for that.\n\nWhen it came out, after a good deal of time, it was a small cup of oily mushrooms, a plate with half an avocado on it, and a small cup of cottage cheese.  Um. Gross.\n\nI stole a piece of my partner's toast, mixed in ketchup with the mushrooms, and put it on the toast with a little avocado on top. It was ok, but I could have made it better myself, and for less than the almost $7 they charged me for my \""meal.\""\n\nAdd to that the homophobia and transphobia we felt, plus the coffee refill guy walking past my partner's empty cup not once, not twice, but three times, and we'll not be back. Which is too bad, because my partner love love loved her Denver omlette and hashbrowns.  Folks, it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant."
3,Our whole group was surprised at how much we liked the show! I almost always go for cirque de soleil but this was s real crowd pleaser. And he is seriously buff
3,"After a traumatic experience last time I had my eyebrows waxed, I decided to let them grow out. So, when I walked into E.D. Nails I had some fuzzy caterpillars on my face in dire need of cleaning and shaping. The facility was clean and simple. They had nail stations and spa pedi chairs. I signed in at the front for waxing as was greeted by Ly (pronounced Lee). She pointed at a black office chair in the corner. As Nathan D. mentioned, the setting was a bit weird. Don't expect a nice, serene waxing room. They should at least invest in one of those padded massage tables for their waxing area. Aside from the setting, Ly did a great job. She listened to my concerns and did a great job cleaning up my eyebrows. She kept a nice natural shape. The price was right and the job was done well. I'll be back!"
2,"It's the cleanest filly\""b\""s around. Soda was a bit syrupy and the bathroom was just cleaned. As a result of the bathroom I think my lungs have permanent damage. \n\nThe food was good overall. About what is expected of fillibertos."
4,"They change it seasonally, a great space for a stroll.  I highly recommend it."
1,"After all the hype and excitement about this place I gave it a try.... not impressed.  Expensive for an average burger.  The only thing that was cool was the free peanuts but then again, not a huge fan of peanuts with hamburgers.  GO TO SMASH BURGER INSTEAD!!!"
3,"I stopped in with my Dad for a quick beer after dropping my wife at the airport. As we entered we were greeted by an excitable fella who enthusiastically invited us to join him for a brewery tour. The tour was $5 and it included a beer in the bar and a tasting during the tour. The brewery itself is an impressive operation, and you know how the beer tastes. If you go on a Sunday I recommend taking the tour.\n\nAs for the place itself. Yes, it's large, and the atmosphere is as \""restaurant/bar packed into a warehouse\"" as it looks, but the people were friendly and the seating in the upstairs lounge was super comfy. If you have time, check out the Ale Asylum for yourself."
0,"Was not impressed. Confused why there is a wait and the place seems to be popular. It was dirty, service was impersonal and the food was second rate at best. The shrimp was undercooked in both the appetizer and entr\u00e9e that we ordered. The sauce for our fried calamari was right out of a can. We tried two appetizers, four dishes including pho which was watered down and under seasoned. There is no love in this food."
4,"I have always been a coward when it comes to dental work of any kind. My wonderful regular dentist referred me to Dr. De Andrade for a periodontal consult. It was decided I needed my bottom four front teeth pulled and implants done. I was a mess with fear. Dr. De Andrade explained every step while his office staff comforted me and explained everything from appointments needed, payment options, medications and driver I would need. I was still very scared. When my husband and I walked in for my surgery the office staff was wonderful. They explained everything to my husband and took me to a massage chair to relax. WOW. I was still expecting pain when I woke up or at least by the time I got home. I was wrong again. I had NO pain. I never took any pain meds that were prescribed and never experienced any pain. Two weeks later I went for a follow up and a minor problem with a rough edge was corrected and Dr. De Andrade was so wonderful with an upbeat attitude. I look forward to seeing him in three months when my healing has taken place and permanent teeth are ready to be placed."
3,"I've been coming here for years! Way before the whole renovation to make it look more upscale. I kinda miss the old ways. When they had the fish tanks upfront and you get to pick your fish/shellfish. This place has become the official sobering spot for nightlife people. Food is always good and service is that typical of asian restaurants. Get your food quick, eat it and get out so they can turn that table. They also raised the prices. supply and demand right? Overall, I will keep coming here for good food and they're open 24/7. Don't expect friendly service but fast and efficient. works for me. after a \""pho kim long\"" night drinking...nothing beats a large bowl of pho."
4,"This really is the best frozen yogurt place there is in Surprise.  It's always spotlessly clean, every flavor is worth trying, and the selection of toppings has a nice mix of healthy and not-so-healthy options."
4,"I needed a good gynecologist and I found the best one ever when I went to this facility.  On my first visit, I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff.  I was seen by Dr. Dombo.  I found her to have a warm and caring personality, a thorough approach to my healthcare, and accurate answers to all of my concerns.  The office is clean, modern, and very nicely decorated, and the staff uses the latest technology to record patient information. This doctor is a keeper for me!"
3,"I've been to Mimi's before, but had a really nice experience at THIS Mimi's.  I took my mother in law to brunch.  We were seated by a window in a small-ish room.  We hadn't spent time with each other in a long while so we slowly ordered our eggs benedict and coffee (both excellent).  What was best was that the waitress figured out that we needed some good catch up time and while she was very attentive, we never felt rushed or like she needed to turn a table.  I've never closed down a breakfast place before but we managed to and it was just what we needed.  Relaxing and perfect."
1,Don't go...lot of filler in rolls and two of my rolls taste like mold.  They said the mold was the ginger mixing with shrimp.  It want my first rodeo and shrimp and ginger does not taste like mold.
1,"If you can find the place... Avoid it.\n\nIt's a tiny hole in the wall of a bar; which is acceptable, considering I live in Chicago and tight bars are our specialty.  I went with friends to see our friend Lola perform in her drag show of the evening.  It was fun enough as money and props flew around the bar's open floor 'stage' area.\n\nHad it not been for the somewhat under attentive bartenders and the overwhelming amount of cigarette smoke I would have had myself a fantastic time.\n\nNot being a smoker and living in a city where smoking is prohibited in bar and within 15 feet of a public building; I must say... It made me appreciate the Chicago law even more so.  If I were management; I'd figure out how to give your smokers appropriate areas to enjoy their death sticks, away from those of us who'd rather not die as a result of their desire to do so.\n\nIf you're looking for a good night out, somewhere you can let loose and enjoy yourself... You may want to venture somewhere else."
2,"Rev is a solid place for good za, and a great beer selection.\n\nI have been here MANY times, sometimes after work at the bar alone with a Red Oak and a personal pizza, other times on the weekend on the patio with a bunch of friends. \nUsually good service, sometimes it can be a bit slow, especially on drink re-fills and such. \nPizza is always good, build your own with some unique things you don't find at most pizza joints. I always get the fresh mozz, and basil makes a huge difference, in addition to whatever protein I decide to go with on the pie. Careful, those little toppings add up quick and could make for a pricey pizza. \n\nA great go-to spot in the neighborhood!"
1,This Walmart was very sad.  The area isn't that great (not dangerous just not super nice) and although I was able to get everything I need and not have to wait in a long line I probably wouldn't go back.  The store looked very old and definitely needs some sprucing up.
2,"Having been dragged to vegas pre-21, I've had the privilege of watching a lot of the shows in vegas. I have to say this one was not all that impressive compared to others. \n\nThe things I did like were; \n1. The circular stage. I thought it was nice that anywhere you sit, you get a good view of the show. \n2. If you stay at the Wynn or Encore they give you the $125 tickets for the $99 price. \n3. Some of the acts were pretty cool. Some of these performers have to be so incredibly strong to do what they are doing and it's impressive (although u can see similar things at cirque de soliel shows)\n\nThings I didn't care for:\n1. The story was really bad. Basically there was no story. It was really difficult to follow and it let me wondering half the time, what are they trying to tell us?\n2. Besides some impressive stunts, the overall show was only blah. I didn't leave there thinking WOW that was AMAZING! Sometimes I thought there was too much going on and would of been better if they did less. I think whoever put this together got too caught up with the concept of... this is vegas so the show better be big and glittys and more is better. (sometimes less is better!!)\n\nOverall I probably wouldn't go back to see this show again. I don't think it's worth the money a second time. If you haven't seen it though, it might be worth checking out. I did have a few friends that did enjoy the show but I dont' think anyone was blown away by it."
1,"The price ended up being double what I was quoted from another table installer.  Plus he lied about the cost of 30/30 felt costing him $425.00, I can get Simonis felt for half that price.  I feel the company took advantage of my wife's good nature and trust in people when making the deal. Plus I had to call back the installers and have them redo the slate due to bad pocket alignment, the pockets on the rails was not even close to centered on the slate pockets. I also ordered a cover from them and was promised delivery but if I wouldn't have called I'm sure the cover would never have arrived.  I ended up requesting a refund after two weeks of waiting. Due to the cost of installation, the rework and the failure to deliver a purchased product I wouldn't use this company ever again."
4,"I love how customer service oriented this place is. I went in last thursday and they were having a wine tasting later in the evening. I ended up recieving a complimentory truffle to account holders. It was a sweet gesture and the truffle was really pleasent. \n\nTheir flavor of the day roast that they have been doing ::Pumpkin Spice:: is absolutely a hit with me. The flavors dont taste at all artificial and it is so season appropiate. I love their Kona and Guatamalan blends they occasionally have. \n\nGreat Coffee shop, wonderful place to chat the day away."
4,"I found Ashley (ABA) through Yelp. She had 5 stars across the board and it's easy to see why. I've had eyelash extensions before, but they always began falling out after only a few weeks, with Ashley, they lasted so much longer! My lashes look so lush and full I don't think I'll ever go back to my natural lashes! \n\nAshley's work space is clean and tranquil, making for an amazingly relaxing experience. She's very steady handed and will explain to you the steps of the process as she goes through, warning you of any possibly oddities you may feel (like a slight pull or tug when making sure there wasn't any extra/stray glue). Not to mention how friendly she is! It totally feels as though I've known her for years. \n\nNow that I found ABA, I don't see myself going to another place for lashes in the future. I 100% recommend Ashley for eyelash extensions; you can certainly tell that she takes pride in her work with end results."
3,"I made a similar comment about the Meadows Mall in general, but the same applies here: This is a retro style Disney store.\n\nAnd when I say \""retro\"", I mean \""good\"".  Disney stores popped up in the malls during the 1980's/1990's, and were a good place to get Disney related movies, games, books, toys, music, collectibles, and whatever else the \""House of Mouse\"" was hawking at the moment.  Then the stores started closing out, then made something of a return.  But what came back wasn't as good in comparison.  If it wasn't the creepy \""sterile\"" feel to the revised stores, it was the total lack of variety in items.\n\nThis is an old-school store, whether it stayed open all this time, or Disney realized that their new look was awful.\n\nIt's a great store for the Disneyphile, and largely better than the hit and miss (and increasingly \""miss\"" as time goes by) store out there by the outlet mall.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful, and have either been really knowledgeable about what they sell, or very helpful in trying to track something down or simply get answers.\n\nGranted, it's a little weird seeing Iron Man and Spider-Man in the store as a result of the Marvel/Disney merger a year or so back, but hey, more variety.\n\nPrices are a little lower at regular stores such as Target or Toys R Us, but the Disney Store is selling more theme park related collectibles now, and those are DEFINITELY cheaper here than in Anaheim or Orlando.\n\nMileage depends on how much you like Disney, but it's a fun store to browse around in if you're about the Mouse."
3,"This place was really good, and not to pricey for the quality you are getting. The white Ceviche was the best I have ever had.\n\nThe stuffed peppers were great also."
4,I am in love with this pizza. I love the crust! I can't eat cheese or meat so I ordered a veggie pizza without the cheese and it was heavenly! I wish there was one closer to where I live.
0,"I wanted a Mohawk Combover Fade and I got some garbage skunk tail on the back of my head.  I was so upset I left and went to great clips to repair the irreversible damages.  I even showed a video of what I wanted- I don't understand how much more clear It could have been. I'd give this place a 0 if I could.  My hair is now decent after my 2nd haircut today, but the cuts from their razors on the back of my neck is another story.  I sure hope that blade was sterile.   If you want a traditional old fashioned haircut, I guess this is the place to go.  Not for me.  I also asked for advise from the 1st barber I approached to recommend the individual who could do such a cut, and he obviously steered me wrong.  Not everyone in there is as great as he made it out to be.  Absolutely a horrible haircut, my neck burns, waste of time and money.  Absolute garbage."
4,"loving the chicken. loving the waffles. loving the grits. loving the trough of tea.  lo lo's has it all!  apparently yesterday got a bit insane, but for sunday (today), they've brought in extra help.  super nice staff, super tasty food.  kid friendly.  i don't know what's in the waffles that makes them so good, i don't know what's in the chicken breading that makes it so good.  i don't care!  it was tasty as all get out, and luckily, it's within walking distance from us!  hopefully, this can help our area get some more foot traffic, and also help some of the lovely other eateries in the area (like the noodle ranch).  \n\nyum!!!"
4,"I swear by Korean cold noodles when the temperature rises over a pit-drenching 30 degrees not including humidity. When my style is crapped and am unable to ride with the windows down and the sunroof open, then it's way too hot. Ask for the spicy mustard sauce; it's a mix of dijon and vinegar that adds a completely different level of awesomeness to this cold noodle dish. That sauce is usually used for another cold soup noodle dish, but it works with this one as well.\n\nIf you noticed, Korean cuisine is all about textures in bite and complimenting and contrasting flavors. Some people might be apprehensive of such a party-pack of flavors, but you'll just have to try. If you're courageous, then take a dive off the deep end and challenge your comfort zone and try something new. You never know, you might like it... Unlike my nephew who only eats chicken nuggets, french fries and my mom's egg fried rice."
2,"After being in the sun and pool all day, Hunger pangs set in. So our group popped in here on way back to the room. I really enjoyed the freshness of the food. The portions size on the apps here nice. Just enough to fill in the gap before dinner. The 'rita's were taste also. I have to try again when not so tired and the place is open for full menu."
2,"I felt like a total traitor coming here due to my love affair with Lifetime Fitness. However, my friend needed to work out and this was closer. \n\nFirst off, compared to Lifetime this place is crap. It's hideous purple color and these \""no judgement\"" signs are bull.\n\nNow putting my snobbish Lifetime sensibilities behind me I actually enjoyed this gym.\n\nEverything was super clean, from the machines to the bathrooms. And that's difficult to accomplish when everyone is sweaty and needing to poop after a good workout.\n\nI also like the wall of keys, I have forgotten my keys so many times at the gym that I can really appreciate a wall to store keys while working out.\n\nAnd I love their little \""quick 30 minute workout\"" area. It is a totally genius idea and I adored every minute of it.\n\nHowever I've been spoiled by the endless supply of clean towels at Lifetime and at Planet fitness they give you cheap brown paper towels and spray bottles instead. Such a cop out.\n\nSo I would come back for sure, I might even jump ship because it's cheaper and more convenient - only if they replace the crappy paper towels with some real towels!"
1,Pharmacy service sucks. Takes FORVER to get your meds. The staff seems really unorganized. Not writing anymore. They took too much of my time up already.
1,"The location is nice, nice new building, clean, had the makings of a nice BBQ joint but a 30 minute wait for a pulled pork sandwich? Really? \n\nA bun that was burnt around the edges and soggy in the middle. The sandwich was pretty tasteless even with their watery sauces added. The meat tasted like it had been boiled and was extremely watery as well. Fries are nothing special either. Makes me wonder, did Bryan's just do an extra good job at promotions and public relations to get these magazine reviews and plaques on walls? Now, I haven't tried their other selections, which are supposed to be very tasty but I am not sure I will give it another shot if they can't pull off a simple pulled pork sandwhich.\n\nI miss Tony Romas!\n\nP.S. I'm not a jerk, just straight shootin' ;)\n\nP.S.S. I just upgraded it from a 1 star to 2 star for their large portions. I was stuffed."
2,"This place was fine...not great, but not terrible. The staff is lovely, and I like the cool Thai items (crowns and art and religious-looking stuff) that adorn the walls and hang in display cases...but the food is just ok. Thai is in my top 3 kinds of food, so I kind of expect a lot.\n\nI've been twice now, but both times have kind of let me down. I've asked for \""5 star spicy\"" both times, and I get back something pretty insipid. The food is fine, just not so spicy, and not like the party in my mouth I expect from Thai restaurants..."
0,"Be very careful with your bill!!! Check it and check your change! Three times consecutively I have come here grabbing pick up delivery after work and the same guy always seems to \"" accidentally \"" add something to my order and \"" accidentally \"" short me $1 from my change... Really?? Mind you I'm coming to the restaurant at 3-4am... I have a feeling he can get away w/ this since most people eating at this time are drunk or w/large group of people. A dollar here, a dollar there.. That adds up. I feel like he's trying to tip himself.."
2,"My first visit to Picazzo's is not what I had hoped it would be at all.  A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  \n\nSince I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says \""Lunch Specials\"" and where it says \""Sandwiches.\""  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  \n\nInstead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  \n\nMy husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  \n\nAll in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  \n\nMy husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for."
0,Hey Nina my name is Amy & I have sent you a friend request. Apparently I'm being accused of creating your account to slander Kiana because I am a former employee of salon cielo & spa. If you could accept my friend request so we can further this conversation that would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry for your hair. There are amazing stylists that work there like Lisa for instance that can fix it. Dont let one horrible apple spoil the bunch!!!!
0,"What the hell is up with this place? Gave it yet another try and this time it was kind of scary. Our server should not be waiting tables or working around food period. The food is overpriced and just not good. All sauces were watered down and tasteless. We don't need 100 tater tots and watery toppings. How about 1/3 of the amount with quality toppings? I feel for whoever is losing money on this venture, but it's obviously time to bring in someone with a clear vision to save this place."
4,"This is my second visit to Bouchon, and like the first time I came here, it certainly didn't disappoint.  My husband and I were in town for a work conference and decided to stop by for dinner.\n\nFor this visit, we decided to skip wine and just order cocktails.  My husband had the absinthe, which is served the traditional way with a spoon, water, ice and sugar.  I had the Bee's Knee's cocktail, which had gin, honey and UP.  Both were pretty potent.  \n\nTo start off our meal, we decided to get the foie gras terrine.  Although somewhat pricey at $50, this can easily serve 4 people (we decided to indulge ourselves this time).  And out of all the different preparations of foie gras I've tried at different restaurants, Bouchon's foie gras is easily my favorite because it's not seared and doesn't have a lot of other accompaniments.  The waitress suggested having Sauternes with the foie, and we had a glass each.  The one selected for us was waaay too sweet for us - even for a dessert wine.  \n\nMain entrees were the lamb for him (only slightly gamey but was nice) and the short ribs for me.  The most delicious part of my meal was the deep fried marrow that came with my entree - so yummy!  We didn't have dessert this time because we were so stuffed, but I remember their profiteroles being pretty good.  \n\nAlthough it probably can't compare to French Laundry, Bouchon is perfect for a nice, romantic meal in Vegas."
4,"All you can drink beer and wine made this great buffet even greater. I love the salmon salad,  the Korean BBQ short ribs. They were so great.  I will be back!"
0,"My family and I visited this place yesterday to celebrate a birthday.  Let me tell you that it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The fish was horrible and the shrimp taste like it came straight from the freezer section of the local grocery store...actually that's giving them too much credit, because I've had frozen food from the market and it taste 110% better. Not only was the food inedible, but the entire restaurant had a strange smell...that should have been our first clue.  A couple of people in our group had the Gumbo and I wouldn't recommend that dish either.  My son had something as simple as a hamburger, and that was just barely edible. Everyone had stomach issues immediately after leaving the restaurant.  We are all from Los Angeles and have had our share of good fried fish all over LA, so we know good food. All I can say is don't do it, unless you like giving your money away. Let me make one thing clear, they are only receiving 1 star, because I don't believe have any other choice to select lower than 1."
3,"Since moving out of state, I haven't had access to those cheap Chinese foot massages that are all the rage in So. CA now.  On a recent visit to Vegas, my friends and i decided to take a break from gambling to get one.  We have been to numerous Chinese foot massage parlors all over the world, including in China. This was one of the better ones if you don't mind putting up with a little chaos. \n\nI called to make appointments for four of us about 45 minutes ahead of time.  When we walked in, we were the only clients and everything proceeded very nicely for a while.  They set us up in comfy lounge chairs, then soaked our feet in hot water while Peter massaged my neck, shoulders and scalp (I was seated on the ottoman facing the chair). The neck and shoulders was heavenly but the scalp was basically just scratching which didn't do anything for me.  After about 15 minutes, I was instructed to sit on the chair with my feet on the ottoman and he began to massage my legs and feet. Tea was offered, which was nice and I really began to relax.  But it was not to last. A family of 5 plus two kids walked in without appointments and that is when everything went haywire. All four of our masseuses got onto their cell phones to dial desperately for reinforcements.  Peter seemed to be in charge because he spent the most time on the phone.  After a while, I told him just to stop massaging my leg and finish his calls because he was using one hand to hold his phone while repeatedly rubbing one leg as he talked and I didn't feel he was focused. He apologized repeatedly and got up to finish his call.  He also gave me a couple of extra minutes at the end to make up for the time he was away.\n\nAfter the feet, he massaged my arms and hands a bit before sliding out a 2nd ottoman, thus extending the chair into a bed.  After covering the bed with towels, he had me lie down on my stomach with my head hanging off the ottoman and my feet on the chair.  He then proceeded to massage my back and OMG it was wonderful!\n\nI'm sure there was more to the massage, but this is what I recall.  Despite the chaos, everyone was very nice, very professional and I would definitely go again next time I'm in town.  Everyone in the group enjoyed their massage and we all just sort of laughed and accepted that this is the price you pay for an inexpensive massage.  Angel, the owner, showed up (as part of the reinforcements) and was very friendly.  \n\n$38 for 60 minutes, we added on $7 for tip to make it $45/person.  I took off one star for the chaos.  By the way, don't expect authentic reflexology here.  I've done that and they are VERY painful.  These places say they offer reflexology, but it is really nothing more than an excellent massage by a skilled amateur.  Still feels oh-so-good, though!"
0,"Horrible!!!!  We went as a large group,  men and women. The hassle and hustle begins at the door and does not stop till you leave. The place was nearly empty,  but they hasseled us over tables and crazy minimums till we just threw in the towel and left. We had hotter chicks in our group anyway. We'll neeeeever return. 2 thumbs down  for this spot."
2,"The food was pretty good. I had a salmon and kale salad, and the bf had the pizza. Only complaint, my salad came out a few minutes after we placed our order and then had to wait at least 10+ minutes for his pizza. I don't understand when people come to an establishment to dine together they can't aim to serve the food at the same time. It's just awkward.  Other than that, I was pleased with my meal."
4,"I have to admit, I am a sandwich fanatic. I'm most likely to order the token sandwich/burger at any pub, restaurant, or bistro. Discovering Cafe Raymond was like a pilgrimage to the sandwich holy land. \n\nOwner Ray knows exactly what he is doing when he builds those beautiful masterpieces between fresh bread. The menu may seem standard, but the sandwiches are anything but. My favorites include the Club, and BLT. Both sport fantastically thick slices of bacon, and irresistible homemade mayo. \n\nBe sure to stop by on Thursdays or Fridays. Every Thursday, Ray makes a limited quantity of specialty hamburgers. The patties are a beef, bacon hybrid, and rival the best local burger joints. Friday specials tend to be grilled cheeses lovingly tucked between pillowy slices of brioche. Just writing this is making my mouth water. \n\nCafe Raymond also serves breakfast on certain mornings. I've never made it down for that, but legend has it the fare is delightful. It can get crazy in there around standard lunch hours--I recommend stopping by a little before noon or after 1 if you want to avoid the crowd. \n\nFrom the outside, it may look like a standard sandwich shop tucked in the Strip, but I highly recommend it."
0,"Terrible food. Long waits. Overpriced. Don't believe the other reviews! Avoid this dump and you'll save money and eat better.\n\nFries were soggy and cold, totally falling apart when I tried to eat them with my hands and then turned into mush when I gave in and used a fork. The burger was completely lackluster - it was literally the worst burger I've had. Every fast-food place I can think of makes a better burger. The fake cheese completely enveloped the tiny burgers, the bun was paper-thin and flavourless, and their \""all-dressed\"" toppings were practically non-existent. I was literally given a single three inch strip of onion, to put this into perspective. The orange drink was okay, not anything special, and definitely not worth the price they charge. \n\nI went at lunch so there was a bit of a line, but that doesn't explain why I  stood there waiting 10 minutes before ordering. They charged me $1 extra for the bacon on my burger, which is fine but follows an inconsistent logic: their cheeseburger comes with bacon, the double does not. When I got back to my office to eat it, I discovered they had forgotten to put the bacon on the burger at all. \n\nThe whole meal cost $13.30, which is about double what it would cost for better quality frozen food from any of the other dozen fast-food burger places around."
3,"Very good, mostly inexpensive Mediterranean food. Compares well with some of my favorite Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants in Chicago (though a few of those still hold an edge). Definitely my favorite falafel and hummus in Madison. I've had several of the entree options in various forms (on a plate, in a pita) and they're all delicious. They have about half a dozen solid craft beers to choose from.\n\nA few things aren't stellar. Side orders are expensive for a pretty small portion. Like, you pay $4 for what seems like about 3/4 cup of rice or couscous. Also, I've eaten there at least 20 times by now, and I almost always have my order taken by the same few people, but they clearly still have no memory of me (or just don't show it). After a while, this kind of makes a guy feel unimportant."
2,"Went last Friday to try the famous fish fry.  Arrived at 5:50pm and was quoted a 25-30 minute wait, which I found acceptable.  We were not called until 55 minutes later, and this only happened when I brought my two young sons and sat on the floor conspicuously in plain view of the host stand.  At that point we were offered the \""quick alternative\"" of a table downstairs.  Where was this option earlier?\n\nLook, we knew going out on the first Friday of lent would result in a wait and we brought a myriad of distractions along to kill time for our 4 and 2 year olds.  Those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids.  Maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host.\n\nOur server was very attentive and the food was good.  We tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish.  We also had baked potatoes and french fries as well as salads.  Overall, this was not the best Madison has to offer.  We may return, but would only due so as a just a couple or as a family if we could arrive before the rush."
2,"Did a search for Turkish food in yelp and the various places that I ran across did not sound right, this place did. Sadly, it was not turkish food.\n\nThere were also no hot servers, matter of fact, there were no women.. all guys... smallish kind of place, clean... felt family run, of your family was all guys. Definite weird kind of \""I've got a deal for you\"" vibe once I walked in.\n\nHow is a beef shish kebob platter like $24, but the one size down version is $14? I mean a $10 difference means I better be getting some really hot chick to deliver it to me, or at the very least put something on the plate worth $10 extra dollars.\n\nThe food was good, but I think it was more of a kosher food place than a middle eastern place, which I know is difficult to identify, but it was definitely not a place that I would have found myself in unless I was looking for something like that. I was under the impression that it was something else, but I did not come out of the experience scarred or hateful, rather, I am probably not going to go back because of the prices."
0,"Wow, I just had a very pleasant lunch right up  until I receive my bill. the menu price for my lunch with 799, and the finish bill ended up being 12 dollars and 50 cents. when I ask if the tea that I ordered cost 4 dollars the woman behind the counter told me no, the tea was include with lunch. We looked at the bill and not only was the Tea not included,  they also charged me for an eggroll. I then asked them to correct the check and they refused. I asked the man when did I ever order an egg roll? and his reply was I asked you if you wanted an egg roll. when I tried to explain to him that I didn't know that there was a cost involved he compared it to as if he had offered me a beer. in the end they made 12 dollars and 50 cents from me and will never see another penny of my money. buyer beware"
1,Steak has potential. Too salty. Too much pepper. You can scrape it off
3,Crunchified.  Enough said.  You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the burgers here this way.  Absolutely delish.
1,"I was disappointed. \nWent with a large group of 14. The waiter recommended family style, which is fine. We gave him carte Blanche to bring food out. \nEverything was just ok.\nThe  high lights: just the rib eye. Absolutely positively amazing. The service - awesome.\nThe low lights: the grilled shrimp? So over cooked - way to dry to eat and believe it or not the foie on crostini... Simply because it wasn't a crostini at all, just a cold piece of Italian bread, not crunchy, still soft.\nYou couldn't cut through it. \nAnd again everything else was just ok, . Nothing to write home about. \nIt just didn't live up to my expectations of a Batalli place."
4,"I was referred to this shop by my running group and I thought it was like any other store..and I was very wrong. The moment I stepped in, their service, approach and listening to my problems with foot was great. I have had lot of issues with blisters and they have been very helpful for giving solutions and trying different things to ease my pain.Joe, Flash and Karen have been very helpful and I highly recommend this store for any running/walking needs."
0,"Service was terrible! Soup was just o.k., my boyfriends plate was great, his also looked really good."
3,"Great bar located right inside the mall in front of the entrance to planet Hollywood.  What makes this a great bar?  The bartenders!!!  Both of them were on it...and they were extremely friendly and funny.  Perfect place to grab a drink prior to whatever you're about to do.  Haha.  \n\n$5 shots, $10 long islands, cheap beer.  \n\nMy only complaint?  No draft beer...poop."
1,"Since writing my initial review, I have been in conversation with a representative of Ellis Island who has offered to make things right during my next Vegas trip. Not sure when that would be but they did reach out and make the offer, so that's something anyway. Shows that someone there is concerned with how costumers are treated so maybe next time......."
2,I like this place and will try it again.  One of the biggest portions of pho I've ever tried to cram down my soup hole (mouth)
2,"This Fry's is indubitably in da hood!\n\nThe parking lot has carts and dodgy cars everywhere,  but it has most of the things that you are looking for.  The service is decent and the prices are hit-or-miss.  I've been spoiled with a brand new Fry's that has a sushi bar, chines kitchen, tortilleria, larger liquor section, gas station, self-serve check-out lanes, and no homeless individuals begging for your money as you unload groceries into your car.  \n\nSo, it makes this Fry's seem a bit outdated and ghetto in comparison.  But, it does have most of the necessities."
2,"The ramen isn't amazing by any means, but it's pretty decent. Good fix to satisfy your ramen cravings!"
1,"Starting Off The Night.... They forced me to return to my hotel room...not at The Belagio, Back at Bally's More Than A Quarter Of A Mile away....for not wearing pants instead  of wearing dress shorts. They offered me a pair of their own pants(which in and of itself seems like a violation of the health code. Who knows whose been in those pants) This declined my party of 9 to a party of 5 until me and one other member of my party could return to the restaurant 30 minutes later at which point everyone was starving and contemplating dining here. \n\nThe food is average nothing really stood out, the price is centrally based on the contents of each dish. \n\nThis place only earned two stars. I recommend walking another few yards. And eating at FIX."
1,"Went here for the first time, because of the high rating.\n\nI decided to compare the California burrito to Senor Taco's version.\n\nThe burrito Pancho serves is smaller, but slightly better.  I wasn't very impressed with the carne asada or how they made the burrito.  Maybe burritos are not considered authentic Mexican food?  I don't know.\n\nI'll probably order something different next time.\n\nThe horchata I received was also smaller than what Senor Taco offers.  I love horchata and always want A LOT OF IT!\n\nOverall, a decent place.  It is run by nice people who appear to be genuinely concerned about your experience,"
1,"Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I,m not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor, just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .\n         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars."
2,"Epic Thrift is a bit lower priced than say, Goodwill or Salvation Army.  Not as bad as Savers on the overpriced \""antiques\"" either.  A thrift store is a thrift store.  It depends on your personal shopping style or preferences.  We are rehabilitated-rockabillys so we only search for Eames era vintage items.  I could only tell you that it doesn't matter which thrift store you go to, the antiques are sparse and spread out now a days.  Epic is a breath of moth-ball dingy thrift store air!  I like it."
1,"Went with a buddy to check out the AYCE.  You must sit at the sushi bar for AYCE.  The menu is very limited compared to most AYCE places in the valley.  They do have some appetizers that other places do not - like steamed pork buns!  The fish was very fresh and the staff was courteous.  The few rolls they did have were average at best - we tried 5 rolls between us, and didn't find any that we had to have again.  Even the nigiri sushi selection was limited.  Neither of us felt the menu was special enough to come back."
1,"Showed up around 1. The door guys were great, no hassles, showed love, yay. Went inside, The place was a zoo. I mean it was crazy moving from end to end, the bar was hard to find, and it seemed to have more guys then usual. I met my friend, we had a drink and bounced. I put most of this 2 star on my no sleep for 3 days mood so I feel compelled to give it another shot, but from what alot of these other reviews say, I'm kinda spot on."
4,"F\u00fcr jemanden wie mich, der permanent nah am Wasser gebaut hat, ein wahrer Alptraum ;) Auf der Fremont Street muss ich st\u00e4ndig v\u00f6llig and\u00e4chtig und ergriffen heulen.\nDas liegt zum einen am Charme des alten Las Vegas, an den zum Strip vergleichsweise moderaten Preisen, an der gigantischen LED-Decke, an der Zip-Line, an der man sich unter eben dieser abseilen kann, an den B\u00fchnen mit Live-Musik... besonders gerne wird hier Classic Rock aus den 80ern gespielt und Rockfans kommen bei all den guten Bands voll auf ihre Kosten. \nAuf besagter LED-Decke werden st\u00fcndlich Konzertausschnitte von Queen, Bon Jovi, den Beatles etc. gespielt, dazu fahren die namhaften Casinos, wie das Binion's, das Golden Nugget, Four Queens etc. ihre Beleuchtung auf \""zero\"", so dass man die Show in vollen Z\u00fcgen genie\u00dfen kann.\nauch aktuelles Tagesgeschehen wird schon mal an der Decke in Szene gesetzt. So konnten wir 2012 miterleben, wie am Todestag von Neil Armstrong alle Besucher der Fremont Street feierlich ihrem Helden gedachten. Wenn dann durch die lange Stra\u00dfe hallt \""\""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind\"" und alle das Wasser in den Augen stehen haben, dann m\u00f6chte man mitweinen.\nInsgesamt ist die Fremont Street chilliger als der Strip. Ein Besuch an Halloween lohnt sich, hier trifft sich die freakige Gemeinde, man wei\u00df gar nicht, wo man zuerst hinsehen soll.\n\nPS: unbedingt den Pool im Golden Nugget besuchen!!!"
0,"Horrible Horrible customer service. I also bought the living social. I called and made an appointment, however, when I showed up at my appointment they told me they had no record of an appointment under my name/phone number. They did not offer to reschedule or even apologize. Very very disappointed in this salon and I will never ever return."
2,"Being from LA perhaps I'm spoiled. \n\nThe spa looks pretty posh when you 1st enter. The receptionists are all nice, spending plenty of time explaining how you should enjoy the spa. \n\nI've been here twice both times with gift certificates. This place is pretty pricey for what you get.\n\nThe locker room is clean and fairly well stocked with clean linens but you won't find any warmed or scented wash cloths here. \n\nThe 1st time here the showers were ice cold - and you are suppose to shower before the baths, massages, and after massages and baths unless you wanna smell like chorine or sweat. When I mentioned it at check out they said it was because the spa was busy so the water heater couldn't keep up. Needless to say ice shower then into -20c weather isn't so relaxing. \n\nSo the baths is pretty small the pics and the map makes this place look large but it's really pretty small. The steam room wasn't warm at all since so many people were coming in and out- the pool was packed and difficult to find a space where you weren't touching someone. \n\nThe rest areas were also packed and seeing as everyone is in and out of the cold shower/bath. All the seating bags are damp and uncomfortable :(\n\nThe juice bar has very limited options but the 2 I've tried were both tasty (1 smoothie each visit)\n\n1st massage was pretty good got the sore spot in my shoulder and was relaxing \n\nThe 2nd one the therapist was a little more chatty it was way more interactive then I was used to more like assisted yoga. It was a different then I was used to not as relaxing but good stretching!\n\nThe second time I made sure it wasn't a busy day which helped but the seating is still damp and uncomfortable :(. Although I've been here 2 times I don't think that I would come here if it wasn't a gift. Too pricy a little overhyped  for what you get!"
2,"I found this place quite by accident. I went to Tanzy and this is right next door. I didn't realize that is it a whole concept and they are related. Salt, iPic and Tanzy. As a treat for my husband's birthday I got 2 premium plus seats. When we got to the theater the server gave us newbies the rundown. She said popcorn would be served all through out the movie....all they gave us was one bag.  A little bag. So I agree with the other reviewer that said you need a button to push for service because you pay enough to get more than one bag of popcorn. And a disappearing server..."
2,"OK, I know! Its Applebees. Corporate America Grumble Grumble. Having said that, allow me to say this: This particular Applebee's is not so bad. Happy Hour Deals are good & all the bartenders are my age! That's a good thing. I love that I have something more in common with my bartender than Booze! I grow weary of young cocky \"" I am God\"" bartenders so it's quite refreshing to have a bit more to chat about. \nAs I said earlier, the Happy Hour deals are good. My husband & I each had 2 Stella's & we shared an order of wings. Our bill came to only Twelve Dollars! Not To Shabby, I will Go Back Again!!!"
3,"I was sure I'd reviewed here, but maybe I've been reviewing in my sleep (again). Sleeping - now there's a nice segue to my review of staying at Hotel du Vin.\n\nI'd stayed here previously, and was definitely tainted by that experience as I'd been upgraded to a suite. I remembered the breakfast was delicious, the bed was comfy and there was a massive claw-foot bath (which I didn't have time to use, but it was nice to look at). \n\nThis time I was in a standard double room and the difference was noticeable as the room was quite a lot smaller. There isn't really too much else that's different though, there's still a bath (with the shower) and there's a desk if you need to get some work done. The beds are massive and you wouldn't find yourself short of a pillow. On my first night's stay I was in a room on the first floor, behind the bar and was kept awake all night by a weird plumbing noise in the room, and could also hear the person above me moving around their room. Thankfully, getting moved to another room wasn't a problem and the lovely lady on the front desk had it sorted for me in a short while. \n\nThe room I was moved to was on the other side of the hotel, but sadly had the same plumbing noise -\u00a0possibly the air conditioning? I can mostly sleep through anything (e.g. Olympic football matches) so it was annoying to be kept awake by this noise. \n\nMy only other grumble was at breakfast. On the first day, they were able to oblige my gluten free request and I got a bread basket of GF bread as well as GF bread with my eggs Benedict. However, on the second day they were out of GF bread, and still hadn't restocked on the third day. That made me a little sad as with such a fancy hotel, you'd think they'd join the dots and get some bread in. \n\nOtherwise, my stay was pleasant and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the barman in the evening happily kept me going with pistachios which was very kind of him. The staff were really helpful when I asked to move rooms, and I enjoyed being able to sit in the bar of an evening having a drink before going to bed."
1,"Could be better.  I would like to give it a higher rating but just can't.  The food is mostly tasteless and sloppy.  The price is right, but I've noticed whenever I've been there that the staff is stand-offish and unfriendly.  I won't be going there again...."
0,"DON'T FALL FOR THIS SCAM! Customer service is non existent. When I did reach someone, I was hung up on twice because the guy couldn't handle a frank critique of the terrible service. Only help they offer is to charge you for extra services. \n\nMy room wasn't ready until after 4pm and the hotel couldn't do anything about it because it was booked through Jet. They room was filthy and once again the hotel wouldn't do anything about it. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE HOUSECLEANING!! Try to find where it says that when booking. \n\nYou may get a cheaper price, but you get ZERO service or help from the hotel because they have nothing to do with Jet. Jet will give you zero service or help unless you want to pay for extras."
3,"I was here for the Christian Audigier opening night with Nick Cannon.  I actually saw a few celebrities there.  Mike Tyson, Damon Wayans, Jaime Pressly, and an undercover Fergie who didn't want to get mobbed by the fans.  The place looks the same but has a more masculine feel than tangerine did.  I've been to a few venue openings such as Jet, Seven, etc...  This one turned out pretty well considering it's named after the fashion designer himself.  I like the Diesel and Von Dutch clothes myself.  Still wondering about the Ed Hardy line.  I was initially denied access because I wasn't on a list even though we were VIP guests of Treasure Island Hotel.  The lady wasn't trying to hear me so I came back with the big guns and rubbed it in her face while she was holding the clipboard and walkie talkie.  The rest of my night there was solid and didn't really pay attention to some of the nonsense going on around me.  I even took a thank you gift back to the room with me.  Thanks Christian, love ya man!"
3,"Showing some signs of age, but still a great spot for lunch or happy hour- with delicious food of above-average quality and presentation, and well-poured drinks.\n\nSo, sometimes the menus are sticky from not being wiped down thoroughly, but the cute and kind female servers make me quickly forget about that minute detail. \n\nIf you order a salad, ask for the house vinaigrette dressing. If you go for lunch and order the Chicken & Chips, have someone to share that plate with because it's enough for two people."
2,Came here with my boyfriend because we wanted to have a nice & romantic date night. This place definitely has a romantic & fancy vibe to it so expect a pricey dinner. We ordered the calamari & escargot for appetizers & both were very yummy. Then shared the lobster pie & side of ham Mac & cheese. Lobster pie was good but was small & more like a lobster biscuit to me. Came with a whole piece of lobster sandwiched between 2 thin flaky biscuits with a typical pot pie cream sauce with peas & carrots. Mac & cheese was pretty good & it had a smoky taste to it cuz of the ham but I wouldn't say it's the best Mac & cheese I've ever had.
3,"Just hit this place up after reading some of the reviews on here.  Great place if you want a local hangout with decent music and food.  I had the \""Sweet Meat\"", aka, the burger that has a donut for a bun and candied bacon.  The meat was prepared perfectly and had great flavor.  The bun and bacon just put it over the top (in a great way).  The music playing this evening was Jazz and was pretty good for a local spot.  The bartender was great to talk to and definitely loved the place.  Lots of micro-brews and an expanding Scotch/Whiskey selection as well."
1,"Hello again my fellow Arizonians....\n\nI am back and ready to review GANDOLFOS Deli........\n\nI will start by saying the Pastrami is pretty darn good!  \n\nThe meat is seasoned well and does have that NY Pastrami taste.....however..... (and I know you knew that was coming)....\n\nThe price for the amount of meat they give is just ridiculous!\n\nI have read the reviews and if I had a groupon maybe I would have been less dissapointed.\n\nOk, a plain ole pastrami sandwich on their marble rye...which I must point out is NOTHING like good NY rye...the bread is thick and really tastes very little like rye...\nis $10.00.... and is supposed to be served with a pickle slice....didnt happen!\n\nI can only compare it to other local deli's such as Chompies, who charges the same price but the same sandwich but has twice as much meat.\n\nA REAL N.Y pastrami or corned beef sandwich is so thick with meat you can barely bite into it and just half a sandwich satisfies the biggest of appetites.\n\nThe experience started with a call to the restaurant to request they fax a menu which they were unable to do.  The young man I spoke with was not too helpful or friendly.\n\nI had to ask 3 times..... How much is a plain ole Pastrami sandwich....\n\nI asked if the cole slaw, which not included, was creamy or more vinegary...he didnt know how to answer that....  am I asking a strange question here?\n\nThis is supposed to be a deli....cole slaw is typical deli fare.... if I ask what kind...tell me, describe it to me... I am not there and cannot see it, nor did I have access to the internet to look.\n\nSeveral of us from work ordered together and none of us got our \""complimentary\"" pickle slice nor did they include the other condiments we requested.\n\nWe're talking 10 bucks for a regular sandwich....I deserve the darn pickle! lol\n\nI didnt bother to call and have a little chat as the person who had the priviledge of picking up the order mentioned the \""old man\"" we are guessing the owner? Was a grump and not the friendliest of people....so..... here I am, sharing my experience with others.\n\nI do not mind paying $10.00 for a sandwich but that sandwich better be packed with meat....or 14k gold shavings!\n\nOk, maybe it was lunch time and busy....or maybe someone was in a bad mood...or maybe the young kid just started and simply wasent fimilar with their product.... I dont know, nor do I care .....\n\nI am not getting what I paid for and that SUCKS!\n\nSo here's the 25 thousand dollar question....will I return?\n\nNope...not a chance!  \n\nI can get around the unfriendly employees and the lack of knowledge of their own menu but I will NOT pay $10.00 for a sandwich with 1/2 the meat that should be there.....\n\nI will find another good pastrami sandwich or I will wait until I visit New York again.\n\nThere may be some die hard Pastrami lovers out there who simply must have good pastrami regardless of price and to them I say... \""go for it\"".\n\nBut not this girl!  I feel I should get what I pay for and this was NOT worth the price!\n\nAgain, I can only compare it to other Deli's here in the Phoenix area or since they advertise it to be \""NY pastrami\"" I compare it to a Pastrami sandwich you get in ANY N.Y deli and GANDOLFO's looses.\n\nSo, with that being said...give it a try and see what you think.....and until you do.....\n\nBon Appetite'"
0,"The selections of dishes offered have minimal variety, especially compared to the other buffets. \n\nThe quality of the food is basic :/. At best, it tastes like good cafeteria food. \n\nHowever my biggest complaint is that both my sister and I got food poisoning after eating there for brunch/lunch. I think it was the crab legs (which were dry and salty) :( :("
3,"Mosaic was such a pleasant surprise!\n\nYou know that sinking feeling you get when you walk into an expensive restaurant only to find pounding music and a crowd more worried about style than substance? That's what I was expecting when my husband told me we were going to some 'fancy' place in \""Scottsdale.\""\nBut I was totally wrong.\n\n This beautiful restaurant, surrounded by the desert and Pinnacle Peak, was quiet, romantic -- and yet laid-back. \n\nFirst, let's start off with the wine list. It was enormous, containing   wines from well-known wineries, as well as from smaller ones. It notes wines that are organic or grown using sustainable agriculture, etc.\n\nIn addition to meat and fish entrees, the menu offers a wonderful vegetarian dish for each course, which included choices like a potato, saffron and parsnip soup and a salad that had fennel, endive and olives.\n\nFor our main course, my husband had some entree of kangaroo loin and ostrich. While I, personally, couldn't really stomach the thought of him eating a kangaroo, he said it was delicious. I was surprised to see they actually had a tofu dish as an entree, complete with barley, gourmet mushrooms, veggies and a great sauce. Did I feel lame paying nearly $20 for a tofu dish? Yes. But was I pleased to see the chef was considerate enough to  remember vegetarians? Yes.\nFor dessert, we shared a citrus-almond cake. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious.\nI'd highly recommend this place. It's pricey, but with it's slow-food focus and its creative meals, it's one of those rare places that you feel is actually worth it. Also, the food was very healthy, and we left without feeling uncomfortably stuffed."
1,"I came here for a wedding, and at $300/night, I had high expectations.  Wouldn't you?  The \""resort\"", if you can even call it that, looked like an apartment complex.  Maybe it's just how things are in Arizona, but I was not impressed with the architecture or design of the \""resort.\""  Pool area was probably the nicest area.  Rooms were spacious and clean, but had obvious signs of some wear and tear.  There was a mini fridge.  Nice balcony area with some patio chairs, but without any view really.  Electronic key cards was a disaster.  They kept getting deactivated and we always had trouble opening the doors.  It usually took a few tries.  They need to update their system.  \n\nFood was mediocre.  I've had better at other weddings that weren't as expensive as this place.  I usually finish my food because it's delicious, but I barely ate half at this place.  They only filled our coffee cups once.  \n\nStaff was friendly; nothing remarkable.  They tack on a mandatory cleaning fee ($3/night) and bellhop fee ($6? or was it $9?).  They charged me for a candy bar ($2.50) which I did not eat; they promptly took it off.\n \nOverall impression.  NOT IMPRESSED especially for the prices they charge.  I was expecting something more, but was disappointed."
3,"I went here with an old girlfriend a while ago and I will always remember the food, and the ambiance. It is a great date place, the service makes you look smooth as heck and the food is romantic in style and flavour. No messy plates or warm food that should be hot or cold salad that got caught under a hot lamp. We had the crab claw cakes with sweet chili sauce and wonton soup. Flavour profile was there without tasting like a typical asian style soy based soup. The meal was great if I remember correct my girlfriend had the peanut butter chicken and fried spinach and I had the vermicelli with beef skewers and sauce. All food was hot and had chopped peanuts to make it salty and crunchy, added with some fresh cilantro and coconut flavor --- yeah it was a great night."
3,"Yeah, Jack in the Box, 4 stars...So, where is my Assclown tiara? I intend on wearing it all day for reviewing a corporate giant like Jack in the Box. However, where does one get a real ice cream shake from an independent in less than 5 minutes? Maybe not the best testing criteria, but I intend on winning the argument because it is my review!  \n\nSeriously, Jack in the Box has maraschino cherries and real whip cream on their luscious chocolate milkshakes. I can't speak for anything else on the menu but if you are craving a chocolate milkshake with real ice cream- hey, they came through with the cherry and whip cream, I have no reason to believe its not real ice cream and not some strange milk solids and it taste like bliss. So, blow through drive thru, treat yourself to some real whip cream and a cherry!  \n Truth in advertising alone is well worth 4 stars."
0,"I had a plumbing issue with a sewage smell coming into my house through the shower drain.  Service One Home Warranty sent this company out to troubleshoot.  The guy they sent (dark hair, surly) was rude, disrespectful and dishonest.  When he discovered that there was no easy access to the plumbing, he told me to pour bleach down the drain.  I told him that I was interested in RESOLVING the problem, not masking it.  He answered every question I posed to him with a shrug and an \""I don't know.\"" and was very flippant.  He then went outside and called my warranty company and told them that everything was fine and there was no odor.  When he came in to have me sign the order form I refused because he misrepresented what he had done.  He just wanted to get his $55 service fee and leave.  Anyway, I eventually got the problem solved with a different company but had to pay ANOTHER service fee for them to come out.  Don't patronize these jerks."
2,"After reading a bunch of good review about this buffet, as a buffet fan, I decided to give it a try when I come to Vegas on my 21 bday. This craving is good with lots of food culture areas. However, honestly, I am kinda disapointed about the food tasting here. It quite so so but the cocktail is sooo good. Not bad for a try."
3,"The short story: Excellent ambiance: Very old school, dim lighting, chandeliers, dark bar. Lovely Christmas decorations, greenery, black and white feather Christmas tree. Tile floor, lots of cougars. Yea, I don't know why that's relevant, but I thought I would mention it. \n\nDrinks - extensive menu. The chipotle pepper margarita was awesome, REALLY spicy. I had the kale and orange salad, which was good, but not as outstanding as all the reviews on this website would lead me to believe. W side of white beans, which were yummy also. My date had the steak tacos, which he thought tasted like salted cardboard. But I didn't try them so can't say. They looked good. Anyhow, I am looking forward to going again but next time will try the guacamole and the squash tacos. Oh and the bread pudding."
4,"Fast, healthy, affordable, delicious! I'm addicted. The people are friendly and it's all so fresh. Parking is easy. They do breakfast, lunch & dinner. It is a must try!"
4,"Just got home from a three night stay at Red Rock and I can honestly say that I will never stay on the strip again....\n\nKeep in mind... I've been staying on the strip two to three times a year since I was born.... my parents were big Vegas fans. For the last 20 or so years, my wife and I always book a suite at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. We decided to switch it up after reading so many great reviews of Red Rock on Yelp and Trip Advisor. Besides, Bruce Hornsby was playing Red Rock so we thought... \""Why not?\""\n\nOne of the best decisions we ever made. Here are some of the things we enjoyed at Red Rock that we never could get on the strip...\n\n Beautiful suites with a stunning view of Red Rock Canyon, Friendly, caring staff everywhere we went, Cheap great buffets ($4.99 for Breakfast, $6.99 lunch $12.99 dinner), the latest in gaming equipment, an ultra cool 72 lane bowling alley, 16 screen movies, food court with actual good food, great restaurants, great music acts in a lounge that holds maybe 300 people for $20(!), 19 hiking trails of different difficulties, mini fridge in our suite and locals a plenty. Most of the people at the casino were locals.\n\n Such a different vibe then the strip.... totally relaxed. Whoever hires and trains the staff is doing a stellar job. I can't emphasize enough how cool everyone was. When I asked a bartender why every staff member we encountered was so cool he thanked me and said it was because no one wants to be fired and have to go back to working on the strip or downtown.\n\nOur new favorite place to stay. We didn't visit the strip once.... no need to. Everything you need is right here."
2,Cheap Chinese food
4,Close to home... First time trying Sushi and it was excellent!!! Small place but worth it..\nTo go is just as good as well!!!
2,"Wir hatten nicht reserviert, und so mussten wir an der Theke eine Viertelstunde darauf warten, einen Platz zu bekommen, denn es war Samstagabend und ordentlich was los. Die Wartezeit verk\u00fcrzten wir mit einem Ale, das wir allerdings nicht \u00fcberzeugend fanden  Geschmackssache! Weil wir original schottisch essen wollten, bestellten wir Haggis, ein Schafsgericht mit Innereien. Leider wurde es nicht in der traditionellen Form, n\u00e4mlich im Magen serviert, da war wohl unsere Portion zu klein und auch wenns nicht schlecht war, das Gericht wird es wohl nie \u00fcber Schottlands Grenzen hinaus schaffen ;) Was auf den anderen Tellern war, sah aber sehr gut aus und roch noch besser, ich w\u00fcrde also fast sagen, dass man sich an Meeresfr\u00fcchte und Fleisch am St\u00fcck halten sollte!"
0,EXPENSIVE! not only it was expensive but it wasn't even that good.  the sashimi wasn't fresh either. BLEH! Good thing my friend bought a coupon from restaurant.com for $7.50 (normally its $15) for the $25 gift certificate or else it would have been really expensive.  \n\nWhen we got there it was empty! We waited for someone to get us seated and we showed her the $25 gift certificate that we had.  She told us that we had to order $25 and up for the coupon to be valid.  There was 5 of us so we decided to order 3 dishes and split that.  We ordered:\n- Mandalay Bay Roll (one of their special rolls) - $18.50\n- Dragon Roll - $17.50\n- Yellow Tail Roll - $9.25\n\nThe rolls were nothing special. Each rolls had at least 8-10 pieces.  The cutting of the rolls were sloppy.  The way they cut the Yellow Tail was in chunks.  POOR FISH! So i was eating a chunk of fish than a slice of fish.  \n\nWe really regret coming here.  We should have bought the $40 all day buffet pass.
2,"This place needs to get on their game. They are located where the old Salty Senorita's place is in Old Town, and although it is very different inside, the reputation of shitty service has stayed. \n\nMy husband and I have been here two times now, and the first time was a much better experience than the second, but that might be because we knew the bartender, Colby, and he treated us very well. The second time we were ignored for about ten minutes at the bar even though I could count the number of people in the entire restaurant on two hands while watching 3 or 4 servers go back behind the bar and then back to their own section. Not even as much as a \""Hello, has anyone helped you yet?\""\n\nHaven't had the food yet, but heard it was pretty good. Their drinks are a little expensive for that part of old town, but that's just my opinion. Had a good selection of beers though! Although, the glass cleaner was broken, and someone had informed us that it had been broken for over a week already...huge waste of water to just keep it running and not have it fixed right away, and that may have played a part in my opinion. I mean, they haven't even been open for 6 months and there are already problems that are obvious to customers that aren't getting fixed. Wonder what would happen if it was a problem where customers couldn't see, how long would that take to fix?! \n\nAnyways, we will probably go back to try it a third time when we are in the area, but would never intentionally go out of our way to go there."
4,Love Chino Bandido's! Great food that you can't find anywhere else! The combination of Chinese food with Mexican food is truly genius. And the fact that you get a snicker doodle cookie with your meal is a plus! My favorite is the jade red chicken burrito and jerk chicken quesadilla.
1,The grand canyon is a wonderful place. But it gets boring fast.
2,"Really good place to enjoy tacos. It's was a little confusing on where to go when you walk in especially if you never been, but the food was great and the corn on the cob was best it's a must try !"
4,"Came here for my 5 year wedding anniversary and it was amazing.  The decor is upscale, yet somehow casual and inviting.  The staff was amazing, not just our waiter but even the head chef (who given the space is like 10 feet from you) and the manager who were just awesome.  Food was spectacular, one of the most correclty prepared pieces of medium rare beef i've been served and although it sounds simple, the mashed potatoes are the mashed potatoes against which all others you ever eat in your life will me measured, and all others will be found lacking."
4,"Came for breakfast here Saturday while in town visiting my dad. Everything was awesome. The banana muffins are the best I've ever had. Our server PK was awesome. He's originally from Hawaii and had this cool vibe. Food was on point, service was on point. Would definitely come back especially because my dad lives in anthem and this is the best place for breakfast up there! Request PK for sure also too."
0,"bleh \nnot only did the food taste bad but the service was just as bad! I thought a restaurant with such ambiance would at least do good in food and service! \n\nWe were sat outside of the dark lit restaurant so that we can people watch, and a table mat where you can color on, well that would be the extent of any positive experience at Lombardi. \n\nOur waitress didn't come to our table until 15 minutes later, we had these nann bread to suppress our hungry tummies. When it came to finally serving us she brought us our menu and walked away, she didn't come back until another 15 minutes later..I ordered the gnocchi and when it came out ..i swear it was like little puddles of orange balls..unappealing and unappetizing."
3,"I've stayed here three times. twice in the winter and once in the summer. The hotel rooms are always nice and the rates always a steal! All the rooms are suit sizes so it's perfect for big groups to be comfortable!\n\nWinter trips: this hotel is perfect for winter trips. It doesn't matter that it's off the strip because its too cold to walk around outside anyways. and rates during the winter are so cheap. I just got back and only paid 70 bucks a night!\n\nSummer trip: A hotel on the strip would be better during summer but this is a nice alternative. The pool is really nice, didn't realize the private pool area was topless but its all good! The pool is definitely the best part of the hotel, a lot of fun!\n\nGood hotel! no complaints !"
4,"Everything was simple excellent.  The food, the ambiance (we ate outside) and the service.  One of the best southwest flavor meals I have had in the Valley.  I had the seafood enchilada.  Two for one margarita's on Monday!"
2,"Stopped in for dinner tonight and it was good, just not amazing.  I had a soup and an appetizer and the food arrived in a timely manner and the server was friendly (but does Canada not have unsweetened iced tea anywhere?). The food was tasty, but nothing special. Overall it was a nice dinner."
2,"I review usually if my experience does not match my fellow yelpers. Those that complain about clubs common man....that's not what your here to review!!!! How was the bus, service, value etc!!!\n\nSo I'm no novice to Vegas or clubs first off this saves you waiting in line at a club. Waiting in line sucks!!!! That's our primary purpose.\n\nOrganization was good. Friendly host easy to find. Sweet bus!!! \n\nNow the bad. The \""drinks\"" in the bus taste like a mix of Thai fish sauce and rancid hot cough syrup. \n\nAlso the bus was a total sausage fest!!! Later in the night my sexy wife was having fun on the pole and 2 bachelor party groups had their tongue hanging out. I mean ok I understand but dude... Come on. Seriously they need more girls on that bus!!!!. Some that started dropped off at first or second club. \n\nPositive =sweet bus and no lines\nNegative = gross drinks and need more girls!!!"
2,"We went to Atlas for dinner during restaurant week.  The pre-fixed menu was amazing and had plenty of options.  I was truly impressed with the food and would have easily given the restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't for our server.  I'm not sure if he was having an off day, or was annoyed that it was restaurant week. He was pompous and arrogant and did an awful job explaining the menu overall.  My date was interested in trying the fish and the server pretty much pushed her in to taking a dish she did not want because she had questions about the presentation of the fish (skin on vs. skin off), he left her feeling confused and uncomfortable.  The rest of the evening he pretty much ignored us and disappeared by the end of our meal leaving us with another server,  who was actually pleasant.  Not happy to write a review like this considering this restaurant is the owners passion but feel obligated to share my experience."
3,"Great space and atmosphere with the exception that it can be a little loud and difficult to hear (on a weekend night).  The food is usually excellent, the \""West of the Andes\"" sandwich with tenderloin melts in your mouth!  However, the service can be inconsistent and indifferent."
4,"I never miss coming to this buffet every time I visit Vegas. Among the 6 or 7 buffets I tried, the buffet at Bellagio remain to be my all time favorites! \n\nWhat I love about this buffet is varieties, varieties, varieties! Not just varieties, but the food are in good qualities and most importantly freshness of the food they served. \nThe yummy dessert they served is always the added bonus!\n\nI get this place a \""Go,\"" it doe get pricy so best time to come is lunch in my opinion!"
3,"The only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was crowded and really, really loud (yeah I'm an old fart...what of it).  Honestly, this place is pretty awesome.  I was there with a party of 10 on a Saturday night.  Walked right in (no big lines like the pic on their site suggested).  The bar itself is pretty awesome - LED lit plex all the way around, big screens above the bar to play console games on, decent beer selection for a little bar Newcastle, Arrogant Bastard, Stella and a few others were present).  Killer selection of old school games here...Tron, Star Wars (yeah the killer OG vector graphic, blow up the death star one), Gauntlet, 720 and more...they even have Dragon's Lair.  Seriously, this place is pretty awesome & my friend that lured me up here said that on non-weekend nights, its a much more laid back place (see 5 star in my book).  If you like old school games, booze and people watching, check it out.  There is something satisfying about bellying up to a bar with a friend, getting your beer and a PS3 controller and playing Mortal Kombat while you drink...and this place nailed it."
0,Worst customer service EVER. Thank god I spend my 10k somewhere else. Glad they only got $250 out of us for my ring.  Could not care less that we were customers.
2,"So I finally went to XS after like 2 years of saying I would go! I'm soo tardy for the party I know, I know!  I wanted to see what the hype was about since it's been dubbed the hottest, best club in life ever. I went on Christmas Day with my sister. There was a line that was relatively short for XS. We got in line and surprisingly right when we got in line the guy was already checking ID's to go in. Overall between going to the back of the line and stepping foot in the club it was about 10 mintues, not too bad, I was expecting longer. We each paid $20 (grrr) but I guess it's pretty standard for this club that even girls have to pay, which sucks. They lie and say they only have guest lists for Sunday and Monday even though in the past I was on a guest list on a Saturday but I didn't actually go to the club though, so I know that they do have guest lists through promoters.\n\nAnyhoo, the club is like Tryst x10. Very beautiful of course. The music was mostly house/dance type music that I wasn't too fond of even though there was a sprinkle of hip hop which made me happy. The club was packed even on Christmas Day, so it made me feel better that I was clubbin on what is basically a family holiday! But heck, my parents were in bed anyway!\n\nNot sure if I would go back, because in essence I just wanted to see what the hype was about. I prefer Tryst personally and would rather go there since it was free and I like the music (Top 40/hip hop mix) better there."
3,"1 star - friendly and attentive service. \n2 star - large portions at a decent price.\n3 star - all of the food tasted great.\n4 star - I really had an excellent time enjoying my meal there even at 2am.\n\nI had the steak frittes here and damnnn, it was the best tasting steak I ever had!!!"
3,"Build it and they will come, wasn't that the advice of the voice over narrative in Field of Dreams? This is how I feel about the downtown Phoenix area. As I drove through downtown (I got lost) trying to find the the Ruby Room, I wondered \""where the F is everyone?\"" I have driven and walked through many cities on a Saturday night, but Phoenix was a ghost town. I know there are major plans for the downtown area (light rail dreams) but I just can't wait. (Insert Ruby Room Here)  So I found the Ruby Room, and it is completely obscure and somewhat intimidating as you walk in. I paid the 5 buck cover for the bands to a bearded doorman with a kick@ss CJ jeep, and entered a dark, candle lite bar with deep red paint on the walls. the place was dead except for 3 people at the bar and the bar tender. It was about 9:45pm. I thought., ok should I go?  I said what the hell and sat down. I am glad I did. After paying 3.75$ for a Guinness (amazing price) I started chatting with the same door man (who looked pretty tough) about the difference between Ren & Stympy and Pinky and the Brain. We debated what is a better show and why, and discussed the influence of the Ani-maniacs on modern day \""adult swim\"" like cartoons.  The bartender was cool and very attentive and the crowd (wid ranging) was mellow. The place filled up quickly and as Vic Masters performed. I would say this guy was a cross between Jay Bennett (Wilco, Minus 5) and Buddy Holly and Robin Williams. He did a musical performance act that told a story of his visit to the sun and meeting Nostradamus (basically a large white wig on a stick). It was funny, entertaining, and musically excellent. He actually had record albums he would just launch into the crowd as part of the show. I totally enjoyed this. I have to say this place has potential. If you like the art scene, dive-esque, musically oriented places, this place is for you. Drop your pretentious at the door, open your mind, and enter the Ruby Room. This is not a Scottsdale bar.  It is somewhat hard to find, as Central Ave is a one way and could be deemed as a questionable neighborhood. The fact that someone keeps stealing their 50 pound cigarette astray that is outside (a large concrete object with sand in it) tells me, don't leave your car here overnight, but during the show they have a well lit parking lot, and the previously mentioned lover of Pinky and Brain Door man, watching over things. He even warned me of the one way street when I left, and told me where the cops were. Now that is service ;)"
1,"Returned for another cut and at least this time, the stylist was able to hold a conversation while sharp implements were whizzing past my head. All good.\n\nI noticed later that my credit card had been charged $20. Is a $7 tip appropriate on a $13 cut or does the $15 at the bottom of the slip make more sense? Anyway, I'm done with this Great Clips. I will not return."
0,"Terrible Customer Service.\n\nAs I was driving past the store I saw a huge sign in the window advertising \""buy 1 get 1 free\"" on wiper blades.  With my wipers falling to pieces and monsoon storms looming, I thought it would be a good idea to buy some.\n\nAfter I picked the specific brand up and declined on \""upgrading\"" to the performance blades (that were not but 1 get 1, funny enough) I was informed that the buy 1 get 1 sale was not in effect until tomorrow.........\n\nHaving worked in retail before, it is common practice for a misrepresented sale (most often from a sale display being left up too long -- this case being displayed prematurely) to be overridden by the manager.  The \""computer not programmed for the sale\"" is complete bullshit.  A manager can override anything.  His only solution was to come back tomorrow.  \n\nNo thanks, Wiper blades falling to pieces + Sudden monsoon storm = Danger \n\nI bought the blades at full price.  I will be back tomorrow to return and re-buy them just to mess with their daily merch return numbers.  But if a store doesn't take pride in taking care of their customers, I can't imagine they would take pride in much else."
0,Took my parents and Uncle here and was absolutely amazed at the not just bad but insulting service.  I travel and eat out for work all over the country and this experience ranks as the absolute worst.  Food actually was ok but I will never eat at another Mario B. restaurant or in this hotel again.
0,"Watch out for the bed bugs.\n\nHere for a one nighter. Less than 12 hr stay. Just a place to chill, sleep, and shower. Affordable price. Yes, parking is free, but limited. Expectations were already low to none after seeing the reviews, then I get the bed bugs.\n\nGot the itch driving back to LA and a few days after that. You have been warned!"
1,"Good beers, but... they're way too expensive for me, and the clientele seems a bit too posh and hipster-ish, which makes it a bit unpleasant to be in. It's always ridiculously busy, too."
4,Really good gyros... best I've had in Phoenix
0,"This place is awful!\nThe entrance is hard to find due to construction.\nWe arrived only to find the valet full...ok no problem. My husband decided to wait it out so he pulled in a waiting area with a few other cars while I ran in to check in. \nThe reason we were in Vegas was for a dance competition for my 6 year old...so we had her and our 12 month old baby in tow. I decided to bring my kids with me inside with me to check in. Since check ins are usually fairly simple I thought we would be in and out. WRONG!\n\nI cheerfully stepped in line only to have that cheer stripped away after the line hadn't budged for over 40 minutes. Steadily it got longer and longer while we waited and waited. I had someone hold my place in line to go try the \""express\"" check in...but wouldn't you know it...my reservation was not found. So back in line I went. They had about 2 workers working the counter and one worker servicing their \""rewards members line\"". So while there were about 150 of us waiting in line...the rewards counter never called any one of us. \n\nAfter an hour and a half I started to contemplate leaving. But then I saw a glimmer of light at the end if the tunnel. Another worker appeared. Hallelujah. This person then proceeds to go to the rewards section where there were a hefty 2 people waiting! What a joke! People were getting out of line to go sign up for the rewards program just to get out of that nightmare of a line.\n\nWe finally got to the front of the line 2 hours later...my 6 year old barely hanging on to sanity and her bladder by then. \n\nWhen we arrived at our room we called right away to get our bags sent up. 1 hour goes by...nothing. I call to find out what's the hold up. They tell me don't worry we're on the way. I leave to go get dinner for my family...come back to the room and still no bags! I asked my husband did they call or anything and he said no. Wow...really. 2 hours to check in then 2 hours to get our bags! By this time I needed my kids pajamas and my baby's diapers etc. So I decide to go down to the bell desk and find out what's going on. I am told that they had an \""emergency\"" and that my bags would be up soon. I ask is it normal for check in and bag delivery to take this long and I was told by a manger \""the bell desk has nothing to do with check in so whatever you experienced over there is their problem\"". WOW. \n\nAfter we finally get our bags...get our babies settled...we whip out our laptops. Time to surf the web...plan our itinerary...etc. No internet. WTF! They have the ever loving nerve to charge $13.99 a day for internet. This day in age internet is like air and water...it should be free. If I can wander into a random Starbucks and get free internet why the hell can I not get free internet in a room that I'm paying for???? What the bloody...sigh. Good thing I had an air car but still. That meant that only one of us could surf the web at a time. And to be honest...I think they were scrambling wifi signals in order to force people to buy the internet. Our smart phones were barely working...and my air card mysteriously kept dropping. Extortionists. \nThe website touted \""completely remodeled rooms\"". Oooh exciting right? WRONG. The room was far from remodeled. It may have been resurfaced...but by far no remodeling had been done. Just because you slap up a fresh coat of paint and buy a few new bedspreads does not mean you've remodeled anything. All the fixtures in our bathroom were covered in rust. The toilet paper holder was hanging out of the wall by one screw. The toilet barely flushed and the shower was more like a fire hose. I swore every time I took a shower a layer of skin was ripped off by the uncontrollable water pressure. Paint chips everywhere...around the vanity...on the back of the bathroom door. The shower curtain was dirty...it was all around shameful!\n\nThe buffet = gross and overpriced. Every last piece of food was freezing cold and I need to introduce their chef to a brand new invention that everyone is using...its really cutting edge...it's called SALT. I have never in my life eaten such bland mush. This was the first buffet I have ever gone too where I not only didn't want seconds...I wish I could have taken my plate back over and put every last bit of slop back on the buffet. \nThe pool was at least nice too bad it closes at 6pm. I have even more to add but there is a character limit! maybe I'll do a part 2"
3,"This is just the right place to go to if you need a pho fix! I was surprised when I saw this restaurant in Treasure Island. Of course it's not cheap and fast as a regular Vietnamese restaurant back in Cali, but it's nice to know there is one on the strip.\n\nAs for the pho itself.. I thought it was actually pretty good. The broth, noodles, and meat were fine. The portion they gave was reasonable. Over all it was satisfying, and I would suggest this place to anyone who has a huge pho craving at Vegas."
4,"Excellent Indian food, don't be scared by the looks of the building. I run a software company with 15 employees in Bangalore and travel there a couple of times a year, so while I wouldn't call myself any kind of expert, I do know when the palak spices aren't fresh or the nan was left sitting. Neither of those things happened at Mount Everest. Definitely recommended."
4,"Tried this place for the first time last week for a blowout because I had a Groupon. As a hairstylist with ten years of experience, I am super picky when it comes to my hair. (Why, you ask, would I pay to get my hair styled when I can just do it myself? Because I'm lazy, that's why!) So I scheduled the appointment kind of last minute and Katie B. did my hair. First of all can I just say, Katie is an absolute doll! She's fun to talk to and very sweet. More importantly though, she gave me one of the best blowouts I have ever had, hands down! It was exactly what I wanted: some volume in the crown with loose beachy waves but not frizzy (think Jennifer Aniston). She nailed it and the best part was that it lasted for 3 days! I will definitely be making this a regular thing- thank you Katie! :)"
1,"Average burger, average fries, moderately priced. For what it is its a little expensive, in addition the burgers are 1/8lb so a double burger is a 1/4lb burger?  Be warned, if your using the $24.00 recent groupon they do a weird math thing that deducts the tax from the ammount of your groupon????? So my groupon was only valued at 20.77 ????? and you still pay the tax at the end anyways??? I tried to convince them something was wrong for about 10 minutes and finally gave up. I had also ordered a double western burger which came out as a single burger, I guess they figured the onion rings would throw me off so I wouldnt notice? Overall, this is an average burger joint. I wont be going back."
4,"Just had dinner for the second time, the first was just after they opened early in the year. The first dinner here was awesome!\n\nThe second trip was even better! Porterhouse for 2! Awesome, delish, melt in your mouth good. Started with a unique caesar salad, just about the best in taste and presentation, followed by the steak, and potatoe gnocci! \n\nReally nice."
4,"Stable crew, good food, great air flow and physical environment, and gambling + alcohol! This is your neighborhood casino and mine too.\n\nDebbie in the morning makes a great Bloody Mary from her own recipe. Lisa in the evening keeps bar like none other. The whole staff here has been here for years (at least the four I've been coming here).\n\nFull bar. Great beer on tap (Newcastle and Budweiser products and more) . Lunch specials daily. Big screen televisions for sports galore. Player loyalty card with bonuses.\n\nTell them you saw my review on Yelp and if you see me, give me a wave."
3,This was actually a very cool place with lots of not too overpriced product and a good sales section.  We especially liked the line of recycled product from Coke UK and the 'Coke Around the World' sampler (which we didn't try) was cool.  Much better than M & M world.
2,"My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for over three years now and we still love the food...I wish I could say the same about the service.  More and more frequently we have experienced absolutely horrible service.  Ranging anywhere from inattentive service to incorrect orders being served and more often less than hot.  The thing that has prompted me to finally write this though was my family's most recent visit.  Some twenty plus minutes after we ordered, I had to alert the waitress to the fact that we still not been served any of our meals (even my son's salad), while the table behind us who had arrived 5-10 minutes after that had already received there second helping of all you can eat wings.  There didn't seem to be any real reason for this since the restaurant was fairly empty (it was before 6:00pm),  We soon got our food (my son getting about a minute for his salad before our entrees came), but there was no explanation of what happened or even an apology for what happened and the food was lukewarm to boot (even though the waitress cautioned my son about how \""hot' his plate was). \n\nI know not all the staff is so inattentive, but honestly it seems to be getting worse and worse over time.  If we could get the menu items elsewhere we likely would never return to this location...And yes, I plan on completing the 'survey' on their receipt with this same narrative!"
2,"I've been here multiple times over the past couple years withe different groups of friends or dates or solo...  And always with the same result.  I want to like them. It's great beer usually and I appreciate the look/construction.  But parking is atrocious. The service has been horrid on every occasion.  Whether sitting at the bar or at a table, it takes forever to get served or have orders followed up upon to put it mildly.  \n\nThe food is ok. Not great. Not bad. Just ok for the price.  \n\nI keep hoping the service improves, but it just hasn't. It has gotten to the point where I only stop in for rare beer events now. And even then I question if it's worth giving them the money given the lack of service/hospitality. \n\nRecommended.  But only if you're not in a hurry..."
4,"My girlfriend suggested we try this place and it was an incredible experience!!  This is a very fun and entertaining place to dine, the meats were very good and the service is off the charts. We are Las Vegas locals and we'll be back to this place."
3,Other than the food being a little greasy and the decor being unfinished this is a very good hole in the wall. My reuben rocked!!! The bacon cheese fries were an exercise in excess that made me exercise more after eating them! lol
2,"Decent place to hang out. The rooms are...aight, for the price you pay. The hotel has a sweet lazy river that I'm sure is the main reason people from out of town come here to stay. There are also plenty of great places to eat that are really close like Tutti Santi, Moto Sushi, etc. \n\nUnlike most places in the area there aren't too many yuppie scum running around, but you will overhear someone complain about something ridiculous if you listen long enough. \n\nLike any hotel/resort you should expect to pay about 10 bucks for a drink. That's just the way it is. I'd definitely recommend the buttes in Tempe if you're really looking for a \""stay-cation\"" type place, but if you have a groupon or something for this one, things could be worse."
4,"I always have a great time when I go to Xclusive Ultra Lounge.  Their bottle prices are the best in town and they give you the *true* VIP experience: you can book one of their private rooms to enjoy drinking with your friends.  This unique feature is one that you just don't see at any of the other clubs in town and, for people like me who like their privacy, makes the whole experience SOOO much better.  If you DO want to go on the dance floor, there are always cool events going on like Three Six Mafia and Too Short, but their VIP rooms are still my favorite."
1,"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nThe worst part is that the pizza here was recommended as God's gift to Las Vegas.  In fact, while I was eating, I can't remember exactly how many people drooled over me like hungry puppies and asked where it came from.  Confused yet?  Me too, because I didn't get the pizza.\n\nOh, but I dearly wanted to.  Unfortunately this establishment had something else in mind and sent me a calzone instead.  All I wanted was a Hawai'ian pizza to have an even playing field for comparison, but it was a pick-up order and not by me -- so I ate it.  As far as a Hawai'ian calzone goes, it was a first for me.  The all too uniformly, finely diced ham would probably be from a bag somewhere, and the pineapple from a can somewhere.  Actually, the pineapple I wouldn't have issues with if it had some of the caramelization typical of cooking atop a pizza pie.  Double-whammy for a mixed up order.\n\nFor a calzone as a whole, I've had some awesome ones.  This did not rank among them, but it was good enough to want to finish in one sitting.  It wasn't small either; quite a bonus.  Also considering that directions to this establishment were given out about half a dozen times just because of how good it looked should garner some respect."
0,"Absolutely horrible experience after MANY positive experiences.  I am not sure if they changed ownership, but I could have arguably just had the worst pedicure/manicure of my life.  If you are going to do a bad job because you do not have a lot skill, that is one thing, but my tech could have cared less about doing a good job.  LAZY, expensive and we waited almost 30 minutes just to get in.  This will be my last time here."
0,I am a seasoned buffet vet and this was the worst buffet I have ever eaten at in Vegas.  We went for brunch and it was so sad.
4,"We had a great time here picking out furniture for our twin boys Marshall and Mathew.  the sales staff was great and knew the product very well.  We always try to support the small business owner, and i would advise other people to use this shop because of the great individual service."
4,"This is one BADASS MOFO of a bar.  You'd have to go to the Double Down first to get a good idea of what kind of BADASS MOFO bar experience you're in for.  If the Double Down is too rude for you then you won't like the Fink Bomb at Frankie's.  And if you don't like the Fink Bomb at Frankie's then you're probably likely to enjoy one of those plastic \""Yard\"" margaritas over at the Mirage."
3,"This was our first time here and we really enjoyed it! There were many things on the menu that we had never tried before and we liked that. We basically asked the staff what they recommended and ordered that. I asked for mine \""hot\"" and it was at the most medium in spice. I have found that people don't usually take me seriously the first time I dine somewhere and request \""hot\"". That was a bummer for sure. But the flavors were great. We had the mini idlies and loved the different chutneys for dipping. We also enjoyed the vegetable pakoda which was done very well here. Probably the best I've had. For an entrees, we had the masala dosa which was really good! Very different, to me, as I've not had it before. I had the chole batura which was excellent. The portions are huge and easily made for leftovers and for enough to shared. I will definitely come back to try some different things. The menu is very extensive and prices were really good."
4,"Save your money...\n\n...don't gamble it all away! Instead, spend it at Buchon! Granted, even though our party didn't spend that much for lunch (thanks ML & TK for seriously hooking it up), it was still a sublime experience. Most memorable for me was the foie gras spread with crackers. That stuff is so money! For the main course, we each ordered something different, but we all envied the one who had the enormous bowl of mussels, steamed with white wine, mustard and saffron!\n\nTips: Go all out and save room for dessert. Don't try to compare it with the Laundry, you'll just be disappointed. Relax -- you're not at French Laundry. This is Buchon, a bistro."
3,"Everything was good from the start , hostess and bartender to waiter and busser !!! Food was excellent esp. my Veal Marsala . I will start sending people there !! I was there Mon. Oct. 22 2012"
0,Disgusting ass mexican't Burger king! uuhgg so gross!
3,"Some girlfriends and I came here for a late 'lunch' on Saturday cuz one of them swears that this buffet is THE best in Vegas. We arrived at 3pm and the line was long. I didn't realize so many people decided to also eat at 3pm?! We ended up waiting TWO hours in line. It was absurd. I already had a bad impression of this joint. At least it was dinnertime by now..\n\nHowever, once we were seated, everything made up for the long wait. The steamed crab legs were SOOO good. I like my cholesterol sky-rocketed that night. The six of us were devouring food like we hadn't eaten in days. Everyone was so quiet cuz we were busy stuffing our faces. The service was EXCELLENT! Our waitress, Choy, was a sweetheart! She was so attentive. I mean, it's a buffet after all. I was shocked. She got us everything we asked for AND with a smile. From oysters to prime rib, and their ginormous dessert selections plus espresso bar, this buffet was da bomb. \n\nPrice was $29.99/pp and it includes beer & wine. Maybe that's why this place is so packed. Note to the ladies: make sure to wear a dress, leggings/jeggings or yoga pants so you can pack more food in =)"
1,"Totally overrated! \nWe order green tea frozen hot chocolate, and it is not HOT. Isnt it supposed to be HOT? or am I just taking it too literrally? \nAlso for the strawberry sundae, it was meehhh. Nothing special, really. \nAnd their service is sooooooo slow."
4,"First of all, I should say I was starving. Pregnant and starving. So, I thought maybe my impression of this place was because anything would taste good. BUT, my husband, who wasn't starving and isn't pregnant, really loved it and he rarely likes my asian food choices. \nWe got the pho, which was good, but probably not my favorite, the spring and summer rolls, both of which were very tasty, the crab rangoons, VERY good and craveable, the orange chicken, easily the standout of the order (the sauce is TO DIE FOR...I'll be headed back JUST for this dish), and the kung pao chicken which, while good, maybe wasn't as spicy as I prefer. Also got the beef fried rice, which was great fried rice. Not too overseasoned or greasy. My kids really liked everything, which is usual. \nOverall, a great little find. I will go back again for the orange chicken and look forward to trying some of their other offerings. \nOh, and the service was SO nice. Kids waited with me and got lots of attention in the form of soda and fortune cookie while we waited. Delightful woman taking the order."
1,it was okay.....small place but the food was good....large portions....
2,Food was very good. Much more traditional than typical chinese take out places. Some very interesting menu options.  Big portions.
4,"As apart of our daily business, we value the workmanship of an Excellent Moving Company. We can always count on the guys to take care of our customers and their items. They are always prepared and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to moving the largest items in the tightest spaces! Whether or not the item is arriving to our store or being delivered to the buyer it is always wrapped for protection and safely stored on their truck for transport. We consistently recommend them daily and every time our customers come back letting us now how amazing their experience was!"
4,The most luxurious and decadent spa in Las Vegas. Facilities and services are first rate! Separate facilities for men and women. In addition to the hot/wet rooms there is one that is chilly and it snows. Several Roman Jacuzzis at different temperatures.
3,"Four stars for cheap tables, beer pong, and zero pretentiousness. They have some of the friendliest blackjack dealers and very low table minimums. That is a double edged sword in the fact that you love the dealer clapping for you when you hit a blackjack(even if its only a $5 bet) and want to wipe that \""sorry better luck next time smile\"" off of there face with your fist when they beat you four times in a row.  Its hard to hate someone that is taking your money and telling you that they didnt actually want to do it. The location is great, right in the middle of the strip across from Ceasers. When Im done losing $25 a hand and getting the feeling that $1 tip for the cocktail girl isnt enough, I head across the street to O'Sheas. If you have the very fortunate pleasure of getting Phil as your blackjack dealer, then you are in luck because he is the nicest guy in town, dealer or no. You dont get the theme or ambiance of the goliath resorts up and down the strip, but you do get genuinely nice employees and very friendly players at the tables."
3,"my favorite girls and i gathered here to begin my bachelorette party with a private wine tasting. we sat at the large kitchen table in bacchus, which was thoughtfully prepared with linens, snacks, flowers and more wine glasses than i knew what do do with. i loved that they didn't just give us a brief description and tell us to drink we also had a sheet of paper and a pen to take notes. it was a great take home so i would remember what i loved and why i loved it. suffice it to say our memories were less than stellar by the time we left.\n\nbacchus is a comfy place. i felt like our leader was extremely knowledgeable about wines. she answered our questions and suggested which snacks to pair them with. the tasting was really interactive, and the perfect place for 12 girls that all know me, but don't all know each other to start the evening."
2,"I've found myself at this library several times sp far this year.  \n\n Each time that I have been to this library, it has been for a meeting of some sort. The library may not be the first place that organizers think to host a meeting, but this happens to be one of the more perfect spots.  This library can be the perfect place for a meeting that might pull in people from all over the valley.  This library is in a very central location, it is on the East side of Central Ave and is just above the I10 and South of McDowell.\n\nI have been to meetings in the Pulliam Room.  This room is fairly large with a wonderful sound system and technical amenities.  My only problem with this room is that the required rental is 4 hours, but the seats are HARD wooden seats.  Not so nice on the bottom if you're sitting for 4 hours.\n\nI have also attended meetings in Meeting Room A and Room B.  Small rooms with no audio visual equipment, minimal amenities, and awkwardly situated in the same hallway as the restrooms, so there is a lot of traffic and noise right outside the door when your meeting is in progress.\n\nAll in all, this is a nice library."
2,"I don't pay enough attention to how much dry-cleaning and alterations \""should\"" cost.  So it's hard for me to compare.  But generally, I feel like this place does decent, yet slightly overpriced work.  But they're right around the corner, so I would rather pay a few extra bucks and not have to hunt down a different place.\n\nThey've never ruined or messed anything up.  Sometimes my alterations have come back a tiny bit shorter than I expected them to be, but that's not consistent.  I've seen the same guy over at Irene's, so maybe he does work for her too."
0,"Can I give a no star?  First and last visit!\n\nMy friends dragged me in on a Friday night right before 6:30 pm, something about 'Irish Nachos' and the experience was dreadful.  From the waitress with nothing to do who looked our way and fled in a different direction to the group of staff with the 'lalalalala...don't see you' expressions on their faces.  I kept looking for the people from Mystery Diners because really?really?!\n\nI wanted to leave right then because I really hate bad customer service.  My friends convinced me to tough it out for the first round of drinks but decided I was right when the waitress dropped the plate of  Irish Nachos to the table hard enough to make the food jump.  You had 5 customers who walked in the door with the intent of ordering drinks, appetizers, and dinner and you had 5 customers leave after 5 drinks and one plate of Irish Nachos at happy hour prices. \n\nI won't be back."
2,"We ate here last weekend.  We were definitely jonesing for sushi.  Unfortunately, we found it to be only mediocre here.  After  a couple \""okay\"" pieces of salmon, I tried the tuna and it was stringy/chewy.  It actually took about 20 seconds to  get it to the point where I could swallow it.  A second piece was similar.  A couple more and I started to lose interest.  Atmosphere and staff were nice, but wouldn't go again."
1,"Ate here, as we were staying at the Luxor.  My girlfriend and I split the wild game tasting plate. It had antelope, boar, and venison.  All of it was fine, but nothing special. I can highly recommend the beef carpacchio though.\n\nThe filet mignon (12oz) that my friend got did look almost perfect though."
2,"My gosh, it's been the $8 bowl of noodles streak... this apparently is the new price point when you go to newer joints with higher rents.  Had the wonton pho bowl, the individual ingredients were fresh and tasy but the broth itself was very bland.\n\nWe'll be back, but probably b/c more so of its location right across from the W. Valley Lee Lee's."
2,"I stayed here for 2 nights for a girls weekend with my mom.  I haven't been to Vegas in a long time and I wanted to relax by the pool and take in the sights. The beach and the wave pool were awesome!  The lobby has ice lemon and lime water, we wanted some before we trekked out into the hot weather exploring the strip, but they were out.  We asked the guy at the desk if someone was refilling the water, he said it was in progress. He just brushed us off like we were annoying him for free water and we weren't paying guest! 10 minutes later still no water, we gave up and went on our way.\n\n The room and bathroom were nice and spacious! After a long day my second night was sleepless, at 2AM there was a guy and a woman screaming and crying! The walls are paper thin, I stayed at Treasure Island and this wasn't an issue! The morning of checkout we called guest services to ask if we could have a late checkout like 1pm, they said no because they were fully booked! When we got downstairs to checkout at 11a the woman at the desk said that we could check out later since our flight was later at 6pm.  Here we are with all our bags and the opposite was being said! We did not want to haul our bags all the way upstairs and down the hallway, it was really annoying that we were told that we couldn't get a late checkout and then be told that we could have a later checkout!  The house of Blues was amazing, food was so good and reasonable for the strip! Large portions for a reasonable price!  \n\nAfter our brunch we went to the spa, I wanted to use my Mlife card to get points for buying the spa day passes, the guy said you have to go upstairs and go to the desk to add points, at the front desk the lady added the transaction to the card no problem! I spent $50 on the passes at least give me what I want!  The spa was nice free fruit, water, tea and bathrobes."
1,"Huge portions / poor quality.  Basically all of the buffets in the Rio are horrible and, of course, quite expensive.  You are better off eating at the Mediterranean or the Asia restaurants.  Not cheap, but excellent quality."
4,"Faith did my hair last night and I LOOOOOVE it! She is super nice and did exactly what I wanted. She took the time with me and really knows that she is doing. She is extremely knowledgeable and keeps up with the latest trends. She took the time to teach me different style techniques and things to do with my hair. I felt very comfortable with her and I have HUGE issues with trusting hair stylist because of incidents in the past. I will most definitely be returning! Thank you, Faith!!!"
1,"People there aren't very friendly.  People that ordered their food after me got their food first.  No remorse from the staff.  Only went once, will never go back.  Pretty pricey here too...about 25 bucks for one order of pancakes with chocolate chips, one order of french toast and two orders of 3 eggs."
2,"I used hotwire to get this hotel at a pretty good price. Originally, I wouldn't stay at the Trump. The pros: It is a suite. The Cons: valet parking only and no casino in hotel. \n\nWe stayed 2 days:\nWith no fancy car, we were treated a little differently that it didn't feel welcoming. I tried to tip at least $5 for valet. With valet, I only used them twice. We walked the strip most of the time to avoid dealing with their valet process that made us uncomfortable. \n\nIf only their valet treated us the same as everyone else, then it would have felt relaxing. I see it as business. You do your job no matter the person of dress attire or status. Your beliefs stay at home. Your job is service and customer happiness.  However, I didn't feel it here."
4,The sales were Amaze - Balls during black Friday.  So many selections and great items on sale. I couldn't even think straight.  The purses of all sizes were great. even the clearance was beautiful.
1,"I am amazed that this place has won the Best of Las Vegas multiple times and is currently ranked as one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas...\n\nThe service just met my expectations, not bad but nothing special. \n\nThe ambiance reminded me of an old fashioned diner. The decor was very dated and to be honest the place felt dirty to me.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered omelets, the Jamm's specialty omelet and the Ruben omelet both notated as favorite items on the menu. Maybe we just ordered the wrong meals as both left a lot to be desired. The home potatoes were inedible. It's a shame I was given such a large portion. The meals do however come with a \""pot o' bread'. You can choose cinnamon raisin or white bread. These reminded me of bread my grandmother used to make at Thanksgiving, just plain ol yeasty bread. This trip down memory lane gave Jamm's the extra star. \n\nTo be a good breakfast spot, the coffee needs to be spot on. This was another failing aspect of Jamm's. They use Illy coffee which I find to lack the robustness I love about coffee, almost watered down. I know many people love Illy though so this might just be a matter of preference.\n\nOverall, I will probably never return to Jamm's. I typically give places two chances to win me over but on a good day Jamm's could probably only muster one additional star out of me."
0,"GOT A GREAT DEAL TO STAY READ THIS!\n\nWe found a deal for $50 a night for a deluxe room. We wanted to stay where our 4 year old would have fun at pool. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!\n\nCarpets stained on 5th floor room and hallway.Elevators doors showing previous signs of graffiti gonna post a pic of that. Our AC in the room we got on this floor room 135 didn't work well. They brought great excuses. \n\nWe moved to 30th floor after complaining.  There was broken pieces of glass in hallway I complained about 3times never taken care of. Mold in shower, stains on carpet. Just gross !\n\n30 minutes in line to check in which looked like it only got worse\n\nTo many people at pool water looked very cloudy and gross \n\nWe are taking the loss and moving hotels today.\n\nI AM EDITING CAUSE WE ARE CHECKING OUT TO GO ANOTHER HOTEL AND I WANTED TO ADD TO THIS.\n\nNo blow dryer in bathroom! When we called down they were acting like we couldn't find it! 40 minutes before we got it.\n\nGLASS STILL IN HALLWAY AFTER TELLING THERE HOTEL STAFF ON 6 DIFFERENT OCCASION."
2,"If I had to choose between Garcia's, Macayo's, La Parilla Suiza (here in Phoenix) and Abuelo's... I'd choose Abuelo's before all the other places. Why? Simply because for a chain establishment, the food offered is quite good, and the prices comparable. \n\nI tend to go for the seafood choices of Abuelo's I've had the Pescado Guerrero and the Enchiladas de Cozumel. Both entrees are good, the Pescado Guerrero is a mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp,\nscallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced\navocado in a delicious white wine sauce. It's delicious, the mahi-mahi isn't fishy at all, and the accompaniment of the roasted peppers with the sliced avocado balances the dish. As for the Enchiladas de Cozumel, it is crepes filled with fresh guacamole, covered\nin a rich white wine sauce with a medley of perfectly seasoned\nshrimp, scallops, mushrooms, fresh spinach and roasted peppers, the dish is similar to the Pescado Guerrero hence why I like both. \n\nAnother plus for Abuelo's are its tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla are so crisp that they're quite addictive, and the salsa is not overtly spicy, and has a thick consistency. Something that I do enjoy. So, if you have a hankering for some Mexican, I suggest you try Abuelo's if there's a location near you, it's worth it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
1,"As mentioned on other posts, they have the wine list of Cowboy Ciao which is super extensive.  However, you would think, being a \""wine bar\"", the staff would have a better clue of recommendations.  We asked for a nice big cab that is less than $100.  You would think, that wouldn't be too hard for someone to make a few recommendations but they simply could not do it.  Pretty comical, especially for your Scottsdale scene.  We ended up randomly selecting a bottle and it was good but not what we were looking for.  Their food is great, especially the Stetson chopped salad.  The olive bowl is the best olive bowl in town if you're an olive lover like myself.  I love the atmosphere as well.  Again, too bad they don't know anything about their wine."
2,"This is a popular place so usually skip it due to a short wait list...just don't want to wait  for pizza and so many pizza shops in the area.  No wait on this Friday night.  Bado's has  all that you need..a good beer selection, neat atmosphere, and more than pizza..pub grub, lots of options here.  The wait staff was good and on the ball.  \n\nBut the pizza is what most people talk about so we ordered \""Bado's  Famous Pizza\""   (the traditional, Our most popular crust)\"" and the hot wings.  It did not take long and the pizza and wings came out.  The wings were hotter than most places and pretty good.  The pizza crust was a little thicker and nice flavor and chewy, good though I tend to prefer thinner crust.  All in all, a nice place, good beer, good service and food."
1,"Pizza is a little below average, I think.  The name of the place is certainly misleading. I have lived in NY and in Miami (aka the 6th borough of NY), and this pizza is far from NY style.  It was not bad food.  But it was not great food either.  And the price was very high for what I got.  I called in 30 minutes ahead, had to wait another 10 minutes when I got there.  Servers were friendly enough, but nothing extraordinary.  I will not go back because the pizza was bland and unmentionable ... and expensive."
1,"Just because a business is in a nice area.  Doesn't mean it's the automatic bees knees!  I hate giving low star reviews, I really do.  But boy oh boy, the trouble we went through to get to this place just wasn't worth it.  \n\nI've never been to the Scottsdale quarter, parking was horrible.  Do I really need to valet park to go shopping?  Really?  Anyways after driving around the thing 2 times we finally decided to park in a loading zone.  It said 5 minutes, well 5 minutes was all we needed.  I was going to get a smoothie so I figured the energy boost from my smoothie will give me the endurance and stamina I need to chase the car down the street if I don't make it back in time and it gets towed so I wasn't worried. \n\nThe place was nice and small.  It had a nice look to it that made it seem like we was really in for a treat.  I know it's not October but we got tricked instead of the treat.  I will admit I am being kind of harsh on the place.  The girl who helped us was very nice and informative of the drinks.  But like other Yelpers have said, they were out of a few things.  My girlfriend got the Weekend Warrior I believed. Which consisted of almond milk, vanilla, honey, and few other things.  Hers had a nice taste and even better aftertaste.  I should've got one of those.  Instead I got the Immunie.  And the only thing the Immunie was immune to was providing good taste.  It seriously tasted like very bad watered down orange juice.  I would've been more happy if they gave me a packet of Tang and said have it.  The drink was such a rip off at over $8.  Seriously, every time I took a drink I would just look at the drink with a stank eye and just wanted to punch the cup. Cause I felt like a idiot for continuing to drink this mugging in a cup. Every time I took a sip I said \""eight dollars!\"" I've never wanted to punch a cup before in my life until that day.\n\nEven after saying all that, I would try the place again. If I happen to be in the area.  I went out of my way to find the place.  I won't make that mistake again, cause it was not worth it.  I usually like to give a place a couple chances and try something else on the menu before I review it.  But that drink just mad me angry at how bad it was for the price that they charged. I think when I got done with that watered down orange juice and was about to throw the cup away it spoke to me. It said \""knock knock... Who's there? Orange...Orange who? Orange you glad I took your money?  No...I'm not.\""  That last part my have been a dramatization."
4,Excellent value for the price. Probably the best way to introduce Filipino food to people. The selection is big and the price can't be beat....
1,"This restaurant has deceivingly beautiful decor. Looks like a nice restaurant, comparable to The Keg, but the cheap prices of their food matches the quality. I got their shrimp scampi jn lobster sauce and it literally was like a frozen dinner meal. I've had lean cuisine meals that were better quality. Fine service but the food leaves a ton to be desired."
1,"I was really excited to head out to Harlow's for the first time. The parking lot was packed but the wait wasn't as bad as I expected (for a group of five). Coffee was fine nothing special.\nService was really good. Our waitress was very attentive and the food came out super fast. The two stars come out when I saw my plate. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (with sausage links) and it looked like the most unappetizing dish I've seen in recent memory. The biscuits were these tiny square atrocities and the gravy looked so bland with just a couple of micro sausage bits.\nI know it is biscuits and gravy, not always the most beautiful dish but the taste was pretty bad too. Everything tasted like it came out of a package.\nNow I realize this is a diner and the food isn't always the best but with the price premium on this stuff it is not worth checking out. The food was over $8 and the coffee was $2.55\nMy roommate had the chorizo burrito and enjoyed it but said it wasn't anything special.\n\nAlso, if you decide to go with a group of friends, bring cash. They won't split the check."
4,"So many options, so little room on plate! So happy they had Asian noodle soups. Was everything we chose delicious? No, but there were so many great things that the couple so-so things didn't matter."
4,They have 164 reviews & they have all 5 stars. They're obviously doing something right!\n\nI absolutely love getting my eyebrows threaded here. Everyone is always so nice especially the owner. She actually cares about her customers & is really good at what she does.\n\nI definitely recommend this place.
0,"The owner cancelled a group reservation yesterday that I had for tomorrow night, and proceeded to tell me that he didn't want our group in the restaurant. He wanted us to rent the private dining room and select group menus, but Open Table or the Mundo hostess I spoke to on Friday didn't tell me that. I told him that he could split us up in to multiple tables, but that it would be an inconvenience -- but he told me that we'd just end up 'taking it out' on his staff and didn't want us there. I've heard from multiple people that their service was horrible, but this takes the cake. It's too bad because their food is good and it is walking distance to the Smith Center. I was a regular customer before the shows, but I won't be returning."
1,I have to give 2 stars this time since our service was so horrible. Thankfully the food was amazing.  Our server was so flaky it was becoming a game with us. She never filled our waters..we had to get up and ask the hostess after they were empty for over 10 minutes.\nThen she messed up the bill.\nIt was 2 all you can eats..how do you mess that up? LOL\nWell she did. they fixed it and it was all good.\nGonna make the drive to Yama next time...
4,"Perla Capetillo is a hair magician!  Moreover, she has a heart of gold.  I found Perla through word of mouth and thought I would try her since I had been getting my hair done at an expensive nearby salon for years, and, quite frankly it looked like crap - so something needed to change.  Enter: Perla the hair magician. \n\n Now, you would think that when you spend $2k to get your hair done that it will come out looking fabulous, right?  Wrong! The girl that I went to at this other salon (NOT Bombshell, but nearby) pulled bleach over my regrowth line and BURNED EIGHT INCHES of my hair off!!!  This is the mess that I walked in with that Perla had to fix.  Not only was my hair fried off, but my self esteem went right along with it.  I was literally in tears about my hair being fried off and looked like freakin Rod Stewart!  I was a mess in all forms of the word.\n\nPerla was SO patient with me.  Admittedly, I am one of the pickiest, most high-maintenance nightmare clients on the face of the earth.  I want my hair PERFECT.  I know that I make unreasonably high demands about my hair.  But PERLA WORKED MAGIC ON MY HAIR.  She took her time, she watched my hair like a hawk as it developed so that there was no further damage incurred, she did a KERATIN TREATMENT which sealed the cuticle and made it SO healthy and shiny, then she installed a beautiful set of high-quality hair extensions, cut them, and styled it into pure perfection.  I walked into her salon looking (and feeling) like a nightmare, I walked out looking and feeling beautiful!  People always compliment me on my hair and say \""Wow it's so healthy and shiny.\"" The best part ... they don't even know that I have extensions!  \n\nIf you want beautiful, healthy, gorgeous hair - then go to Perla.  She is AMAZING!!!"
2,"This store has everything, but its a bit pricier than Home Depot.  One complaint I have about this store is that the register checkout is always really slow.  I'm not sure why.  The Ace Hardware at Missouri and 7th Ave is a much nicer and quicker experience, but this location does seem to offer better prices."
0,"Worst service I've ever received. The bartender was drunk and had no idea how to make any of the drinks or shots I wanted. He had to look them up on my phone and they still tasted nothing like they were supposed to. The bartenders and waitresses ignored us pretty much the entire night. When they finally took our order they told us they ran out of pitchers. I'm sorry, what? You're a bar and you ran out of pitchers? Wow!! Never again will I return to this bar, they give local bars a bad name."
0,"Food Poisoning:  I ate the \""Factory Chopped Salad\""  at Cheesecake Factory on March 19th.  I was violently ill that night.

0,"The Day crew in the Casino is flat out rude. I especially want to call out the nasty floor Lady who was working as a Pit Boss or Floor. I find it amazing that with that terrible New Yorker accent that she should be the last one to make derogatory comments about guests. I was observing her talking trash about the players to some of the dealers and then she goes up to them and asks them how they are doing. Very backstabbing. I really didn't care until she decided to start in on me. I told her I didn't appreciate it and she said \""Why are you listening in on my personal conversations?\"" I replied I wasn't and suggested she reserve her comments for the break room. She gave a fake smile, went over to the computer and did something. Probably screwed up my play rating. Whatever. Selling off my LVS stocks tonight."

1,"I had the Kobe burger n fries... The burger was so dry! I loved the fries though! Glad I tried it, but wouldn't go back."
1,"Finally moved out of the complex and I'm excited to be out of there. At first the place was great but about 6 months ago it took a turn for the worst. People bring ridiculous amounts of people to the pool that don't live there, dogs run around off leash, nothing is done about loud neighbors, people drive in the parking lot like its a race track, walls are thin, people let their dogs piss and shit on their balconies the sidewalks and breezeways, and random people come into the complex and dig through our dumpsters and nothing is done. The prices are ridiculous (my new apartment is bigger, has the same ammeneties, smaller community, and 2 blocks away for the same price of my 1 bedroom at palacio)"
0,"READ THIS IF YOU ARE A COLLEGE STUDENT - AVOID AT ALL COSTS\nI am a college student. I was moving in to my new apartment and a man nonchalantly offered me water and promised more free if I signed up for sparkletts. Being a college student I was suckered in at the promise of free stuff and someone being nice, not knowing the pain and countless hours on the phone with the \""people\"" in the customer service department. This place can't do one thing right - they could fu** up a cup of coffee -  from delivering too many water juggs, charging fees for ENERGY( I already pay a power bill, why do I have to pay sparkletts????!!!!!!!) but foolishly I kept the service, having hope in the human race. Unfortunately my hope has been destroyed, and my wallet has suffered, due to the incompetence of this company and its services. Every day I get water out of this stupid cooler, I kick myself for not buying a Britta. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!"
3,Excellent thin crust Brooklyn style pizza
0,"Mcgraths fish house used to be the worst resturant in this complex, but now that that's gone elephant bar is the winner of the worst. The pictures on the menu were like a dating site - easy to be mislead to expect something great to only be disappointed when delivered. \n\nTerriayki chicken that my husband described as being killed, beaten, finely choped, fried beyond recognition, and them being merrinated in soy sauce for a week. The veggies he compared to the left overs found on the stove When the grill was cleaned. \n\nThe Asian in my Asian chicken salad must have been left in customs. No matter how many rice noodles are piled on the salad, it just can't be improved."
2,"My friend and I dined there on Saturday night.  We were immediately seated after we walked into the restaurant.  The booths are very spacious and far apart from other diners.  I feel that the privacy there deserves 5 stars.  The restaurant is very clean and the service is absolutely wonderful!  The staff is very nice and will see to your needs/wants.\n\n\nShe ordered a seafood platter that she really enjoyed.  Her seafood was lightly breaded, but still had a nice crunch to it.  \n\nI ordered beef tips on top of rice and gravy.  Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the beef tips too much.  The meat tasted like it had gone sour.  The rice and gravy was okay.  The fried okra is delicious and the fried squash isn't too tasty. I am a person who does not enjoy extra salt in my food and this place really met that taste.  Their food didn't have a lot of salt in it!  You can always add on more salt to your food, so that made me really happy.\n\nWe also ordered a piece of chocolate cake that didn't make a smile.  The cake was dry.  The waiter offered to bring us another dessert, but we declined her offer.  My friend and I decided to play Jenga with the cake instead.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant isn't bad for the price and service.  Remember to tip your waiter/waitress well because they run their butts off and your bill won't be expensive!"
4,"5 stars handsdown. Everything is right about this place. From the decor to the boutique and the hairstyling. My girlfriend recommended this place to me since I'm new in town I had no clue where to start looking for a good hair girl. Plus I'm a picky redhead. \nThe boutique was adorable, I'm from Newport Beach and the style out here in Vegas is so not my style but the clothes here reminded me of home! They had all the spring colors and the prices were exactly what I'd expect to pay for cute clothes. ($17-$45)\nMy hair was a mess, I have extensions and my red was faded. Ali gave me a brand new look with amazing rich color and I was in love. She recommended a hair treatment for $25 that she applied and I'm glad I bought it cause my hairs been silky all week! But the big plus was I had an audition to go right after my appt and she styled my hair and curled it to look great and I nailed my audition! Thank you Ali!"
0,"Last Monday (9/10), I called my doctors' office to ask for a prescription to be refilled (that I have been on since 2002 for seizures and restless leg syndrome) called Clonazepam. I was told that the script would be called in to Walgreen's. It wasn't.\nOn Tuesday, Kylie, my daughter, went in to the office to drop off an update\nd Power of Atty and Living Will (for an upcoming surgery) and asked about the prescription, and was told that it would be called in to the pharmacy that afternoon. It wasn't.\nI called again on Wednesday, now three days without the pill, only to be told that it would be called in, and again, it wasn't.\nOn Thursday, I was told that the pharmacy had to send over a fax request to have the script filled and that the doctor would not be back in the office till this Monday, which means I would be without the med for a total of 7 (SEVEN) days!\nI was then put on the phone with a man claiming to be the office manager who told me that the message (which I have never heard, because if you are placed on hold, 623.298.4642, there is no message, just dead silence) would tell you that your pharmacy must send in a fax request...NOT! He refused to listen to my story even telling me that it was my fault and that he didn't care that I used to be a nurse and that he didn't care who screwed up that it was my fault. He yelled at me, wouldn't let me speak and told me that there was nothing he could do. Consequently, last night, I had a grand mal seizure that could have killed me. Google Clonazepam, and look up what happens when you suddenly stop taking this drug after so many years. I have complained to AHCCCS and will complain to Dr. Jeanette Cruz, of Estrella Family Medical the next time I see her. LAWSUIT? POSSIBLY.\nYou don't have to put up with the bull. I could have been told on Monday to have the script request faxed, and problem would have been solved. My daughter could have been told that on Tuesday or handed a script when she was there, but no. At no time were we told...This office dropped the ball, but it's my fault... I COULD HAVE DIED. I WANT HEADS TO ROLL AND PEOPLE FIRED. AM I MAD, DAMN RIGHT I AM MAD. I HAVE KIDS TO RAISE AND A LIFE TO LIVE. JUST BECAUSE SOME OFFICES REQUIRE A PHARMACY TO SEND A SCRIPT REQUEST, DOESN'T MEAN THEY ALL DO, AND I HAVE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS BEFORE!!\n\n~~ I got a certified letter today, 9/20, telling me that I have been fired.  That tells me that this office can't admit to their mistakes and that I am glad that as of October, I am glad I am no longer their patient.  I have alerted AHCCCS, the Arizona Medical Review Board and will be filing a Medical Malpractice Lawsuit as well.~~"
2,"I've done the vegetarian tasting menu twice now. My first experience (over a year ago) seemed elegant, with proper service and a no-trouble attitude about veganizing the tasting menu; the food was solidly \""good,\"" but not memorable. The second time (recently), it was a bit more difficult to squeeze the vegan knowledge and ability out of the staff, even though I did call ahead to ask if a vegan diet could be accommodated when I made my reservation. Our server seemed casual and inexperienced, though friendly and he did eventually come through with the information I needed to decide on my meal options. Again, the food was just \""good.\"" I do realize that Eleven is considered one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants and if I were weighing it against Pittsburgh establishments alone, I might add a star. But I feel that its reputation brings it into the major league, allowing me to unapologetically compare it to the world beyond Steelers Country. \n\nThe distinguishing features of Eleven, I think, are in the breads (try them all, best breads in the city!) and and wine pairings, which I believe are very well done. I've also attended a happy hour here, and I thought the cocktails tasted expertly crafted. You might also say that the architecture of the building is remarkable."
2,"Serviceable food, comparable to a decent \""roach coach\"".\nHot dogs are pretty good (better than Pink's on the Strip though) but not bun length, chili was o.k. but lacks in comparison to Original Tommy's and even Stagg's canned chili.\nThe fries were bog standard for a diner so nothing overly special.\nOverall decent food at a reasonable price but nothing to write home about or go out of your way for."
1,"MEH!\nSat at the bar because I am traveling alone on bidness. 3 people sitting here with 10 empty chairs and I can't get a water refill.\nStarted with the salmon app, don't bother, I thought it would be chunks of salmon but it was like a chicken salad all mushed together with no flavor. Caesar salad was soggy with no flavor. Needed something healthy like seafood so I ordered the sea bass. Has the cook ever heard of seasoning? It had ZERO flavor on a bed of rice & steamed veggies. I doubt I will come back here. Off to Tim Hortons for anything better."
0,"This was the worst nail salon experience I've ever had.  It's been months since I had my first and only visit here.  After my experience, I took the time to write some notes so that when I finally got around to it I could have these details for my review.  So here it is:\n\nI saw \""Crystal\"" I believe her name was.  Up to this point I'd had gel on my nails constantly for months so I wanted regular polish to give my nails a break.  Listen, when I go somewhere to pay for a service, I know what I want.  I don't need anyone to try and up-sell me over and over again.  So her constant questioning me, \""You don't want gel?\"" \""You sure you don't want gel?\"" was flipping annoying.    \n\nThe pedicure turned out fine although the massage was barely there. The manicure on the other hand was a disaster in the making.  Normally when techs remove your gel polish, they let it sit for 10 minutes so the acetone soaks in and softens up the old gel polish so it can be scraped off w/o damage to the nail bed.  This gal \""Crystal\"" lets my fingertips sit in a bowl for barely 10 seconds and then proceeds to use a Dremel sanding tool on me, sanding off the layers of old gel polish. I didn't realize at the time the damage she was doing.  There were points where it felt \""hot\"" on my nails, and I knew she was going at it too harsh but I didn't say anything because I thought this was a new technique or something (after all, she's the \""professional\"", right?).  I didn't imagine she was actually damaging me and SANDING OFF LAYERS OF MY NAILS!\n\nWell, needless to say the end result was rough, uneven, lumpy, full-of-grooves, thinned nails!!!  Which of course means weaker nails that split and crack.  Which is exactly what happened for the next course of months as I had to let them grow out.  She even tried to cheat me out of 2 coats of regular nail polish, since she wasn't pulling in the \""big\"" money with a gel mani.  \""There look, only 1 coat is okay!\"".  I said, \""Seriously?  No, I want two coats\"".  Who does that?!??!!\n\nNever again will I go there, and never again will I second guess myself when a technician pulls one of those Dremel sanders out."
1,"- Made reservations. Japanese guy answered phone. Didn't ask for name/number (meaning no reservation)\n- The place was nearly empty (reservation not needed)\n- Kitchen was resistant in accommodating my dietary restriction\n- Waiter kept coming back and asking why I couldn't eat certain items\n- Sushi was presented quite fancy but, in terms of actual quality, it merits a 3/5\n- Overall, I felt uncomfortable, unwelcomed and unsatisfied."
4,"I could eat here everyday for every meal.  We ate dinner twice in 3 days when we were Vegas last September.  We had the roasted duck curry, green curry beef, Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow, Kang Care, Sai Oua , and the Nam Prik Ong.  Fabulous!!  It's no wonder this restaurant is a James Beard winner and voted the best Thai restaurant in the U.S.  The kicker...the prices are not exorbitant.  We spent about under $50 for two people which included three dishes, dessert, and drinks."
2,"I think this deserves 3.5 stars & maybe more esp since I'm not a fan of fried food so I didn't try any.  That may be a mortal sin at this place but they still offer prime rib which I had medium rare with asparagus & spinach.  My hubs had the ribs with a dinner salad & side mushrooms.  Surprisingly, we went in at 5pm & the lot was full & it was essentially crowded due to (probably) the east coasters eating early since it's really 8 pm for them.  By 6pm, some were done & had left & even more couples were arriving for dinner.  I think we'll be back since Herb, our waiter had even mentioned that happy hour is 2-7 with 1/2 price drinks & apps so how could you go wrong?"
1,"A few different areas to review here.\nWe live in Phoenix and were running in the Phoenix Marathon and Half Marathon.  There were a total of 5 of us.  I had reserved two rooms, one with a king bed and the other with two beds.  I had confirmation #'s for both rooms and both rooms were in my name.  The day before our check-in I called the hotel to confirm and to ask them to put our friends name on the room that had the king bed in it because they were most likely to arrive before us and would like to check-in without me there.  As it turned out, we arrived together so we checked in together. \nI was first and was given the king room.  When I advised the clerk that I had reserved the double room for me he looked for the other room and I could tell from the look on his face that there was a problem.  He took my piece of paper that had our confirmation #'s written on them into the back office where we could see everything play out on the video screen that was at the front desk.  Soon a man came out that must have been a manager - advising me that we were suppose to check in the day before for a 3 night stay and when we didn't they cancelled our room.  I told him that that was a mistake on their part because I had booked the rooms at the same time with everything being the same with the exception of the # of beds in the room.  He again told me that the room was cancelled and that they were full for the night and there was nothing he could do.  I was getting pretty angry now and told him that it was unacceptable especially since it was their mistake and he had better find me a room.  Believe it or not but he found me a room!  Then when we made a joke about how lucky we were to have him solve the situation, joking that did you have to throw someone out, he told us that it actually caused him a lot of work to find a room for us!  Really, it caused you a lot of work??  Your clerked messed up my reservation, it wasn't my fault and you are complaining to me that this caused you extra work??\n\nThe hotel was advertised with having a hot breakfast for the runners which it did not have.  They told us that we could have a danish and coffee.  We also had coffee in our room which was fine.\n\nThey advertised shuttles for the runners. Yes, this was available but we did not use this service.\n\nOur room was old because the hotel was old.  The room was very clean but did have a smell to it.  I think the housekeeping staff does a fine job with what they have to work with.\n\nWould I stay there again?  No"
0,"We stayed here without realizing that they allow pets.  There was barking in the early morning, dog droppings on the carpet in the hallway near our room, and dog mess in the elevator.  When we complained to the front desk, the clerk was sorry, but not sympathetic, stating that she always takes her dog along when travelling.  We will not stay here again, or at any location of this chain that allows dogs."
1,"Dear Manager:  why are you ALWAYS understaffed?  I've been here 4x in the last month and each and every time it has been severely understaffed. And I mean on Weekends during football  games!!!  Today there are 40 customers  here ( I counted)  - yet only one food server  and two bartenders. Yesterday, Saturday, there was only the bartender to take care of everything.  .. Food/bar/bussing.  !!   It's complete nonsense. \n\nFood is average- typical PTs. And the one server today is great ( thank God) .. But I have to give it 2 stars for poor management.  \n\nBeautiful building +comfy chairs= 2 stars."
4,"Amazing food & the absolute best horchata that I've ever had! The atmosphere is great including the paintings inside and new calavera they put outside. The food is always fresh and there's a variety of different salsas to choose from at the salsa bar. Great little place to have around the neighborhood, great addition. :)"
1,"This was the first Dunkin Donuts I've ever visited.  I was sort of excited to try their coffee and food because their commercials make them look amazing.  Been here only a couple times for breakfast, hoping each time would be better than the last - nope.  The breakfast buns were very dry, and the flat, multicolored egg was tasteless... and multicolored.  I've tried both the hot and iced coffee, each seemed very watered down.  The only thing I've had from here with the most flavor was the salty bacon.  But I like bacon, so there's no complaining there.\n\nThe speed and quality of the customer service was on point for both the inside and drive-thru.  The wait isn't too long and the staff was very friendly.  I'll probably only return to try the donuts - those commercials are still convincing."
1,"Wouldn't eat there again.\n\nWe had tickets to Blue Man Group, and wanted somewhere close and reasonably priced. We made a 7:00 reservation. \n\nWhen we arrived at 7:00, the hostess was no where to be seen (the hour we spent there, I only saw the hostess go to the hostess stand once). We were finally seated, ordered drinks, appetizers and food.\n\nThe wontons were ok, nothing to write home about. The calamari was VERY good (the only positive thing I have to say). I ordered beef with broccoli, my husband the fried rice. It wasn't too long to wait for the food.\n\nThe beef with broccoli was not served with rice. When I asked, the waiter said rice didn't come with the dish???!!! I asked for him to bring me some.\n\nThe food was no better than what we get at home for the takeout place, but cost three times as much.\n\nSave your money. Go someplace else."
3,"I would definitely stay here again.  The location was perfect.  Close to the university and State Street.  Free Parking.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast (if part of your rate) was very good.  I don't think I want to stay anywhere else, when in Madison."
4,"The food is excellent, the servers wonderful. It gets very crowded on weekends, but the staff stays on top of things well. We always enjoy the food, and especially recommend the BLT, they serve very tasty bacon...Best new breakfast and lunch restaurant in our local area. A nice touch is their frequent diners' club: earn discounts on further meals by signing up (no card required, they take your phone number at the cash register). Very nice surprise to have an occasional ten dollars removed from the bill..just remember to tip the waiter on the whole amount...grins..."
1,"Boo! \nI really tried to enjoy the food and absorb the atmosphere because I really want the downtown area to become a local hang out and hot spot for great dining. I was disappointed with the overall flavor of the food and even more disappointed with the bill when I left. I don't mind dropping $150 on a casual dinner for 2, but I expect it to be memorable and delicious. I think the menu is 'trying too hard\"" to be hip and the ambiance is about the same. \n\nOn a good note: The drinks are fantastic and the service is GREAT!"
0,"STAY AWAY, spend your money else where. This place wrote the book on bad costumer service. Went there with the family and kids, and they had $10 cover, even for the kids, for a pay per view event. You could get food credit, so there were really trying to make sure you spent $10 per person. But the boneheaded manager would only accept cash to get in, and if you didn't have cash, you could use their ATM and pay a fee. They wouldn't accept a credit card, or even think of any alternative. So we didn't go in. So good luck in this economy, Mr. Buffalo Wild Wings owners, making do, with a crappy customer service approach and boneheaded manager. So we went to Elephant Bar instead and had a great meal."
4,"Los Olivos definitely takes the cake when it comes to car washes for me. Even though I live about 15 minutes away, I always bring my car here at least once a week to be bathed. The wash is cheap, well done and bonus that they are perpetually friendly. If you want a sub par wash that uses brushes and the employees couldn't give a crap about you, please, frequent the other 'cheapy places' closer to you."
3,"Great food, atmosphere, & friendly staff.  While it's not the best Italian out there, for the price around $10 average, it's one of the best."
4,Great place to hang out and watch Sunday Football.  Good food selection and excellent service.
2,"The food was \""OK\"". It has great reviews so we decided to try it out. We had some tuna with mash potatoe appetizer sprinkled with raw onions and a green sauce.  That was good! The steak and plantains were pretty greasy and it actually made my stomach hurt for a couple days. I don't think I'd recommend this just cause if the grease but if you can handle it then it's a must try."
4,I went there about an hour ago and i was happy with my results. I got amazing costumer service and the workers are very nice. The food is delicious and I'm actually eating some right now...yummy!
0,"No openings for anyone coming in for a weekend trip to Vegas.  If demand is that high, make room."
1,"Tried it three times, the flavor is just not there. Go to the Mission if you want to see how great a street taco can actually taste. \n\nI admit the pork belly tacos had a little flavor so two stars. Very weird attitude about salsa there - i.e. they act like it is a precious commodity.\n\nI also heard on 8/1/14 that they closed their doors."
4,Love this place. Friendly service and finally a place in LV that knows how to make a great burger and a great pastrami sandwich. Love the krinkle fries.
3,"First the food: Ordered the meatloaf special for an early (5 p.m.) dinner.  It came with a cup of vegetable soup and 2 sides - I asked for coleslaw and mashed potatoes.  The best vegetable soup I've ever got in a restaurant - probably too much pepper for lots of folks, but I thought it tasted great.  Meatloaf was very good, with a tangy tomato sauce.  Coleslaw was excellent.  Mashed potatoes were - well, mashed potatoes.  All in all, I was impressed.\nVery reasonable prices for what you get.\nService was OK, but I agree with other reviewers that the staff seems less than happy to be there.\nI had been there several times previously and was always satisfied with the food."
0,"If I could put 0 stars, I would.\nI'm pissed:\n\n1. The wait was ridiculous. Which is understandable because its LasVegas, but it shouldn't take an 1hr 20mins to get some damn fondue\n\n2. Most of the dessert menu items are inaccurate. None of the Ice cream waffles had icecream unless you add 1 scoop of icecream for $3 a scoop. But all of the pictures of the waffles had icecream on them.  So the menus needed to be updated.\n\n3.The Vanilla Bread and Red Velvet cake that came with Fondue were old and dry. \n\n4. When we got the check, we were charged twice for 1 scoop of icecream on the ice cream waffles. After explaining the situation to the manager, he made up a reason for the double charge but eventually took it off. But that's it.\n\n5. The server was rude, and after talking to the manager about the waffle debacle, she became offended  and threw the bill at us. (When we were gonna give her a tip because her service wasn't that bad) \n\nOverall, I'm never coming here again. Worst experience for a dessert-type restaurant. The only reason why this place gets attraction is because many celebrities have been there. But this is Vegas... celebrities have been everywhere, it's nothing special."
1,"I love new fast food concepts and when I saw an ad for this place I was so eager to try this place out that the BF and I went the same day...\nIt is right across Green Valley High School and is a cute little spot.\nThe inside is small but not tiny and very clean and neat - A star for cleanliness!!!!\nIt isn't as cheap as I thought it would be but we were there and if I really like a place I would pay extra.\nThey sell chicken strips,fries,drinks, coffee and Beignets.\nAhh Beignets- the Beignets were the real draw to me here- Beignets  are french doughnuts- sounds yummy huh?\nWell I am not the authority on beignets by any means but I thought they were just chewy plain dough fried so that they end up like pockets filled with air  with no taste other than the powdered sugar heavily sprinkled on top of them.\nI was honestly not really liking them...I guess I expected more.\nThe Chicken strips looked hellah good, we could see all the seasonings on the crispy coating....\nAfter taking our first bites I was let down again-No taste!!!\nI do think they should make their own dipping sauces because after  being offered  a few Paul Newman dressings I was turned off....\nThe fries sound great on the menu but you end up with skinny fries that you could buy at Cosco's that have hardly any garlic seasonings sprinkled on top at all....\nAy, I hope they change some things and maybe I'll be back...\nAlso, since their thing are Beignets they should sell them like in 3's,6's,dozens and price accordingly because the price for how they are selling them now makes it too pricey to buy alot...."
0,"It is with long consideration that I write this poor review.  The short of it is that a dispute over a copay could not be amicably resolved without an unpleasant discussion.\nI had been a happy patient/customer on and off for nearly 5 months. I tore my Achilles tender and calf muscle and was slowly rehabilitating my injuries. I have never missed a copayment during this period. Due to large part because Endurance rehab has a system in which the patient can not go into the treatment room without the door being unlocked. The door is only opened when payment is made. So, you can imagine my surprise when I was told that I had missed a payment.  I told them that I'm sure I made the payment but that I will check my on line banking account to make sure. I make payments with my debit card. Once home I check my records and it was clear that the payment was made. When I came in for my next treatment. I told them that the payment was made and their response was that I needed to have a print out of my payment history. Now I haven't done this before so I call my bank for help. Isolating payments to one retailer is not a minor task.  The statement has balance information and my husband didn't want us to share it with Endurance Rehab. After considerable time on the phone I got the payment history. But it had our checking balance on it. We were not willing to share that info with Endurance Rehab.\nMy next appt. I told them that my husband & I don't want to share banking balances with them. It got unpleasant from there. The woman at the counter said that she was done arguing with me and that she was going to take care of the discrepancy.  This had been going on for a week and a half. \n\nThe bottom line is that customer service is a problem with Endurance Rehab.  I can not recommend this Physical Therapy to anyone. There are too many to choose from."
3,"Had to bring my wife's necklace here to be repaired. Service was great, the pretty looking girls were very helpful. In all, we had a very good experience. Looks like we will be coming back soon. Wife had her eyes on something?"
1,I really tried to like this place. It is across the street from where we live and we tried it twice. Service is slow. Do not waste your money on the open faced turkey sandwich it is made with very processed cheap quality lunch meat and brown gravy..........the fried sandwiches are tasty though. I must mention that I bought a large amount of fudge to give out as gifts to clients and was very frustrated every time I tried to pick up portions of my prepaid order...The gift boxes that were presented to me were smeared with little bits of the fudge and soon after they tried to make me use old stock of theirs that just did not have the look I was promised. I would buy a small amount fudge for personal use but not for my office.
4,"We came across this place last Saturday morning as a quick stop before running errands.  I didn't have the highest of expectations, as I hadn't eaten here prior.  We were seated immediately, and greeted just as fast.  Our server Lindzy was cheerful, polite and very helpful in suggestions.  The coffee was strong and flavorful without being overpowering, and before we finished our first cup, our food was in front of us. Highly recommend the chicken fried steak, and the California Benedict was fantastic.  Great experience all around, will definitely be going back!"
1,"While we were circling Chandler Fashion, my husband called the Men's shoe department to see if they had a shoe in his size (Chuck Taylor's, size 14, black or grey).  The associate who took the call wouldn't even go check to see if they had the shoe in stock.  Instead, he immediately stated they didn't have any Chuck Taylor's in size 14.  So, I was frustrated, since we had bought many size 14 pairs from this Nordstrom in a selection of brands.  We felt they probably had the shoe and just were too lazy to check or weren't concerned by the little amount of commission they'd make on the $50 pair of shoes.  So minutes after the call, I went into the store, asked the men's shoe associate (Daniel B.) if they had any converse shoes in 14.  He asked what color, and I told him any color would do.  He went to go check, and brought out 2 pairs (black and white).  What do you know!  Look what a little effort can do!  I bought the black pair.  I left the store and called the store manager (Deb) to explain our less than stellar service.  She said all she could do was apologize for the bad experience.  I made a suggestion; she should discuss customer service with Daniel (or the gentleman) that answered our call.  All to say... if you are desperate for a pair of shoes, don't expect good service from this Nordstrom - go elsewhere!"
2,"Please note that this place should get 3 1/2 stars.\n\nThe food is very good here.  I find it way better than typical bar fare.  Their menu is better than good fo sho.  Good place to watch a game and throw peanuts around.  It is priced very well too. \n\n I would actually like this place alot more, but I always get a waitor instead of a waitress! I love waitresses and I love talking to them and having fun with them.  It completes my dining experience. (GO Ahead and make fun all you want)  Waitors are just not my thing.  If you are going to have a guy in a place like this put him behind the bar and let him make a stiff drink.  Leave the waitressing to the ladies."
2,"Treasure Island sure does a nice job reeling me in with their complimentary $50 dining credit. Unamused by any other venues in TI, we settled with Isla because 1) we heard they made a mean margarita and 2) they were airing the Giants' playoff game at the bar.\n\nStarted off with a complimentary tower of tortilla chips with 3 different salsas, verde being my favorite. Added the chipotle adobo guacamole w/ pumpkin seeds, which was a delightful start to our meal. The flavor was intense, yet refreshing on a hot summer night. I could have kept chowing down on guac for the rest of the evening. Of course, we couldn't leave without trying the masa cakes. My favorite was the beef, but only because the other 2 completely fell apart on me. Least favorite was the queso fundido with chorizo. This was just a hot mess. Thank goodness for extra napkins covering my lap or else my jeggings would have been soaked in grease. The rock shrimp ceviche was a huge disappointment - extremely bland and extra watery. I suppose for a practically free meal, I can't complain too much, but I would not come back out of my own willingness. \n\nI'll give them kudos for making one hell of a margarita that managed to give my brother a good buzz only after a few sips, which is an accomplishment."
0,"We stayed at TI on Wednesday night. Got a 2-for-1 cocktail voucher and we redeemed it there on Wednesday night. Big mistake! Very weak margaritas. The music was horrible to us; sorry, we are not into hip hop. We left right away. \""Glow night\""... I was expecting more like an 80s music type event, which we would've enjoyed, but nope. Adios Se\u00f1or Frogs!"
0,This old lady who is working 4/17/14 @ 11:13 am as a cashier gave me the worst service ever. I couldn't see her name on her name tag but she was rude VERY rude. Never coming back to this one. To be honest I don't even want to give 1 star but I did because I have to. She's lucky she's old. I really wanted to say something to her. Ugh.
0,"When I checked in, my room was not ready. I called the front desk and they said they would send someone up to clean it. An hour passes by and no one shows up. They offered to give me a smaller room. No thanks. I mentioned it to them again, and they accused me of leaving the privacy indicator on the door. I didn't. Avoid this place. Dated rooms. Awful service."
3,The buffet was amazing a ton of choices. This could be the best buffet I have ever been to. Will be back real soon
3,"The Grand Canal Shoppes is one of my favorite shopping and entertainment place in Vegas. I like this place so much, ''enchanted'' ceiling, We get to experience Venice without having to go to Italy, how cool is that! \n\nThere are so many entertainments there, live performance, celebrity chef  restaurants, hot nightclubs, up to the minute retail stores. whatever you want to do, just pick one!\n\nGreat place for shopping, dining and late night fun. Good place for a date day or night .:)"
0,Never again. Accidently booked by expedia. Will never book this airline again. Worst. Flight was delayed. Had to pay for baggage before and was way higher than the industry norm. Had to pay for seat. Had to wait even longer for bags. 3 hour one way flight turned into a 9 hour disaster.
3,A hidden gem. Didn't know about this place until recently. Brought an official guest here for dinner - it was a bit of a risk since I didn't have any prior experience with this place. But was very pleasantly surprised - great and very flavorful food. Didn't really notice the service because we were too engrossed in our discussion. But overall I have nothing but pleasant memories of the evening.
1,"not impressed. \nfood was lacking (cheese enchilada tasted like rubber and beans were over cooked) and service was mildly attentive. with so many great mexican food places here in arizona, i am glad that i dont have to be stuck with Serrano's."
3,"Stopped in quick on my lunch break because my bangs needed a trim so bad! I didn't have to wait long at all, considering it was a walk-in during lunch time. Store was clean and all the hairdressers were friendly.\n\nAmy gave me a quick fix and made sure that I liked how they laid. I was a little picky and she was more than happy to cut it the way I like them.\n\nI plan to go back for a full haircut soon!"
2,Awesome bar great bartender from my hometown works there love to visit this bar when I'm in town
0,Gave Danny's the opportunity to correct the poor wash job the did on my wife's Yukon and they weren't able to deliver.  Poor customer service and same poor results.  Never again!
0,"The kashmiri naan was bland and burnt. The service was crap. Was there for thirty minutes when our waiter came back (after we fnished the naan) and asked if anyone had take our order. I clearly said no and he took our menus and walked away. I gave him sometime.assun was coming back and then went to the rgister nd requested to pay my tab and left. The floors we're greasy ad slick. The bathroom is down a storage hallway. The pappadums we're stale. All in all, the enire place was crap. I guess I will never be able to find good indian close to home."
2,"The cycle of life has inspired me to again pursue a more fit lifestyle.  There are lots of discount options available through my employer, so after visiting some of the choices available, LA Fitness won the challenge of convenience, hours and price.\n\n$25 a month, first and last to start, no start-up fee.  The locations near home (about 6 blocks away) and near work (also about 6 blocks away), I can follow my mood and either swim in the morning before or in the evening after work.  \n\nToday, I visited the location by home.  It is the location I started my LA Fitness experience. \n\nThe locker room is big, ok sized lockers, tile floors certainly cleaner appearing than the carpet on Priest.  The benches are also cleaner.  .\n\nThis location has a clean pool, sauna, hot tub and steamroom.  The showers are clean and bright.  I did not see any standing water; while there, a work crew was replacing the door between the locker room and shower.  \n\nThere is one big water spot on the ceiling that disturbs me.  Since it is a lap pool, what I see appears to be due to a leak in the roof.  Another challenge...this location does not have the towel service that Priest does.  For $10 a month, why no towels at this location?\n\nI stopped in at this location when checking out 24 hour and LA Fitness.  The salesguy at this location reminded me of a used car salesman."
0,"Meh. I was so excited for the frozen hot chocolate that I was easily let down. \n\nNo takeout until 11AM unless you go to the bar facing he strip. Menu says $11 for a frozen hot chocolate, $10 with reward card but I was charged $13! Ahhh! Why did you charge me a different price? I didn't bother asking because I'm not giving any more business to the place after this experience. \n\nAdditionally, the frozen hot chocolate  isn't even good. Tastes like a bad version of blended Milo. No thanks."
4,"Love this place.  One of my two (Lotus of Siam, the other) favorite Thai places in the whole city.  Food is tasty and beautifully prepared.  They do spice on a 1-10 scale and are right on the money.  Not like others where the spices are subtle, here a 7 in spice is solid and did an 8 once and ate t but it was very much at that edge.  Lunch specials are awesome.\n\nIts sister restaurant on Eastern has skimpier portions and is good but not great.  \n\nAlmost every dish Ive eaten there has been spot on."
3,"Go for Sunday lunch when the carts are being pushed around like race cars.  Bring the kids and turn them on to different food.  Try the leek dumplings and the salt and pepper calamari.  Tasty little suckers.  Not quite like being in Chinatown in NYC but for Charlotte, it's as close as you can get.  They celebrate Chinese New Year the first Sunday in February and two years ago, there was this evil white dude sitting on top of the restaurant throwing firecrackers down on the performers.  What the ?!?  But I guess he knew the owners because they saw him and let him keep doing it.  By the way, you can get in and out of this place in about 5 minutes.  Everything is super fast.  It gets really busy at around 12 noon on Sunday, so go a bit early or on the late side.  And the kiddies get free lollipops after the meal."
4,"This is the best Thai place in Vegas.  Period.  End of sentence.  I've been all over country, from Udorn to Hatyai, and this place is just good old fashioned Thai home cooking and Bangkok street food.  I don't know where Food Network get off on Lotus of Siam (worst in town)."
2,"Bourbons is a nice place and I am going to comment only on the late-night atmosphere (bar only) because I haven't gone here during the day.\n\n(NOTE: I have already left a review and because it was slightly negative, did Bourbon's delete it?)\n\nWith that said, Bourbons is a pretty nice Chandler country bar. There aren't many country bars around but this one is right in Downtown Chandler. Yee-haw.\n\nI felt that the place was too small for it's britches in all honesty. When I go out for the night wherever it be the number one priority is to drink. To do this you need either people coming to give you drinks or to be able to get to the bar. This place failed on both of those fronts. There was maybe one server on the floor and the bar was packed.\n\nNo offense to the older crowd but the older crowd that is there up til 11pm stick to the bar like flys on cow-pies. They have all their chairs line up and cozied up to the bar and it is impossible to get to the bar to holler at the bartender. Most seem to be sitting there babysitting their drink for an hour. Even if you manage to tap someone on the shoulder (which you shouldn't have to) the chairs are heavy, bulky, and there are so many people packed in there that you can't move it over to access the bar.\n\nNow I may be 30yrs old, but I still like to occasionally go out and get hammered drunk. Because the bar is pretty much off-limits I pretty much find myself drinking one beer for 3 hours because I know it's an absolute bitch to get to the bar. My suggestion to Burbons (if you're listening) is to ditch half those damn chairs when you stop serving. If people want to stand by the bar then they can do that - I'd just much rather wiggle my way in between standing people than trying to catapult myself over the Great-Wall-of-Bourbon-Jack-Chairs.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty cool. I mean, it's country and I love country. It is a little loud in there though - and this is coming from someone who searches out where it is the loudest in a club because I like to *feel* my music. I guess I would rather my country music to be a little quieter. I shouldn't have to holler at the top of my lungs to talk to someone across from me... at the back of the bar.\n\nAlso, where are the drink specials?"
0,Holy Crap this place was BAD ! ! ! !\n\nIf I could give it no stars I would but I am unable to.  For the love of god people don't stay at this hotel for your sanity and for your health its best for you all to avoid like the plague. Here are a list of problems we encountered\n\n1) No swimming pool (Staff said it was posted on their website but could never find such a listing) (as a consolation they were willing to bus us to another hotel to use their pool)\n2) No hot water (was at best warm if you like that sort of thing)\n3) Toilet didn't flush\n4) Shower head didn't work (well it did about half the time we were there)\n5) Bathroom light didn't work (Same as the shower head)\n6) no plug for the drain\n7) No high chairs when we went down for the breakfast\n8) Room had a musty smell \n9) The hotel ran out of towel (How the hell does that happen)\n10) Saw a roach in the room \n11) Free Wi-Fi worked maybe about 20% of the time we were there and when it did it was horrible \n\nAll in all I guess the thing that really ticked me off is the staff did not give a flying F*** about our problems saying no refund and it was our fault for picking them to stay with.
2,"Chicago themed neighborhood breakfast spot that caters to local families.  It's tucked in the corner of the Smith's shopping center.  They offer a pretty wide/diverse selection of omelets plus some other breakfast dishes & lunch items.  Despite the name, we noticed that they had dinner menus there too.\n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10am, and there was a 15 minute wait for a table.  It has a family owned business feel; everything and everybody has a purpose.  There were quite a few families with children who were all well behaved.  Service was no frills and to the point, but it was difficult to get water refills.\n\nBf was super happy about his omelet, the #20 Polish Omelet that was stuffed with cheddar & polish sausage.  The ham & egg plate was better than it looked.  \n\nThe mentality here was one of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', so I highly suspect that they will thrive on with the same consistency of service, menu, decor, etc.  Will nothing was bad, nothing was overly memorable as well."
2,"I'd consider Daphne to be a Mediterranean restaurant with a few Turkish options as opposed to a Turkish restaurant. That said, I opted for a house special - the Daphne Panini. It was made with Surek - described as a beef pepperoni - which intrigued me to try it. Essentially, the panini was a spicy meatball sandwich.\n\nAt the time of this review, the cafe was understaffed; however, it is searching for new employees, so I expect that to change soon."
2,"I really want to love this place! \n\nThe location and concept are awesome- local, artsy, not-just-coffee shop. Great for a late night (or breakfast!) ice cream/gelato craving, which I have a little too often, & the peanut butter chocolate cookies are worth the trip alone. I have eaten here a couple of times, mostly because I was already there. Pretty good, local and made to order (so don't be in a hurry).\n\nHowever... I have yet to have a good flavored latte, and the past couple of times I have waited at least 10-15 minutes for a couple of espressos and lattes. Milkshakes can be very watery and no bueno, depending on the barista. It is also pretty noisy, and sometimes has random theatrical/musical performances. I'm all for supporting the local arts, but it doesn't make for a quiet, productive atmosphere to get hyped up on caffeine and knock out some homework. \n\nBonus- Wifi, and the single shots of espresso are basically doubles."
3,"Never had the pizza here, which is supposedly but they're known for, but I've had their alfredo. If you order the alfredo, you need to add the shredded chicken, it is amazing! Without the chicken, I think the alfredo would be your regular run of the mill alfredo. The chicken makes the dish a thousand times better and is so yummy! Their pizza cookie is the dessert to order. The negative is that they do not have frozen drinks. They have one frozen bellini but that is it as far as blended drinks go."
0,"I was looking for a new dentist and one call to this place was enough to cross it off the list. The receptionist sounds like she hates her life and is rude and unfriendly. She responds to all questions in a lazy I don't care manner, and when you say thank you, she said \""uhuh\"" and hangs up. No thank you back, no goodbye. I'm sorry but that kind of customer service is atrocious. I don't know how people like that end up getting customer service positions when they clearly have zero people skills. At this point no matter how good the doctor is, the receptionist's ridiculously terrible attitude is a deal breaker."
1,Hard to tell which was colder: my beer or my burrito. The service was non-existent. And had to beg for chips and salsa. Skip this one.
2,"As out of town visitors, we were glad to try something different.  I wondered if the empanadas (fried dough after all) would be heavy.  Not at all.  The chicken empanada was delicious with the sauce and so was the bean and cheese empanada.  Definitely add the green sauce to your whole meal- it livened up even the rice and beans on the side.  Great interior."
4,One of my favorite circle K s to watch for crazy things
3,One of the better pizza we've had.  The place small but clean.  Service is excellent and the food is above average.  If you want wine you must take your own glass and pay dollars for the glass.  We will definitely go back
1,"Typically my mark of a good sushi place is the quality of their fish in either the sushi dinner or sashimi dinner.  Nowadays it's too easy to mask the quality of fish in a roll that has a million other different things loaded in it. \n\nNeedless to say, fish was sub-par in taste and freshness.  I may yet go back just to try the rolls, because the service really was great and the restaurant itself was trendy.  But I wouldn't bank on getting the sashimi again."
1,Ummm I wasn't impressed. The burger was alright (not as tasty as I hoped) and nothing I would go out of my way for. The sweet potato fries were good but again I wouldn't go out of my way for. My coke was mostly carbonated water and I feel it was too pricy for what it was. I'd rather go to In and Out. There was sushi on the menu too so I guess that says something.  It was a lot of food but I didn't want to take it home.
0,Went on several websites to find a map that shows a baggage claim area location. There isn't.  Called several airlines they were unable to find anything. What's up with that.
0,It blows me away how many times I hear people rave about this place but I am not a fan.  Not even a little bit.  Every time I have been there the sushi has been warm- GROSS.  I have crowned this place the most over-rated spot in Charlotte.
4,"Last time was here, Yelp didn't cover Montreal. Now it does, so I can adequately express my love for Juliette et Chocolat. I don't drink alcohol but my friends tell me that the Mojito, etc. are very good. I had the chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream, fantastic combination. It's always crowded but we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes either time."
4,Delicious brunch. Great service. The owners are such amazing people. So friendly. I'm definitely going back!!!
4,"Got to say one of the best brunches I've had in AZ in my long search for such a place after moving from cali and being surrounded by gems like this one. \nIf you want quality fresh tasting food straight from the ground to the kitchen and then to your mouth this is the place. Brought my out of state mom for her bday she was in love, as a beach person she loves the outdoors and their outdoor dining did the trick for her. She even stated she would have never guessed she was still in Ph Phoenix. Between the 3 of us we ordered the monty crisco (my moms fav and so hard to find these days), the veggie skillet, and an omelette. None of us wanted to share! For the slightly urban hippie I feel I am meant to be I'm in heaven here.\nI will be back again and again and promise to try the bloody mary."
0,"beautiful Casino, decent buffet, Restaurant Ok. Mamagement worse than  when the Mafia controlled Las Vegas.  Phony promotions Play the slot, and get free gifts.  A lie from the  casino, A gift is not a few free entries where thre a millions.  False Advertising.  It is sad that management has to hceat people.  It is bad enough , thast the slots are not very loose in my opinion.   And when one swipes their card, the higher gamblers get a better shake. It certainlyis not random.   I should thiink that this is illegal, and should be investigaterd by higher aurthorites. Probably will not haappen, and Station Casinos will continue to rip off players.   A sad state  afairs.."
1,"Salvo Caffe looks nothing from the outside, and to be honest, it is not up to much on the inside either.  This cafe is situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, and so it ought to have a lot of custom from all the commuters, but on the times when I have been here, it has been completely empty.  \n\nSalvo Caffe is a pretty standard cafe, serving all day breakfasts, rolls, tea and coffee, but it doesn't seem to do this awfully well.  I ordered a bacon roll from here several weeks ago, and although it was well priced at about \u00a31.50, the roll itself verged on tasting rank.  The bacon was verging on being a tad undercooked and there was a lot of fat on it which I had to keep pulling off - not pleasant.  \n\nSalvo Caffe is also a gelateria, and to their credit they have a good selection of tasty ice creams available, but this is their saving grace.  \n\nI frequently find the staff quite rude and uninterested in their customers.  There are a few tables inside but most people opt to take their food to go. Salvo Caffe (or is meant to be Cafe???) is  pretty greasy greasy spoon that I wouldn't want to visit again unless if I was desperate."
3,"The hubby and I came here for an earlier than early bird dinner on a quite Wednesday night.  I feel like when all these reviews I missed a good portion of what this place really had to offer, still I had a great dinner.  Half the place looked closed down and the upstairs area was roped off.  The stage was closed down with a projected basketball game going on in the pub area.  We were seated towards the back in a little kitchy table that was one half love seat, one half dining table.  I loved all the stuff hanging from the walls.  While we were near the bar it seemed very cozy.  \n\nAfter a few late lunch crowd folks finished up we had the dining room to ourselves.  Hubby had the fish and chips and I ordered the Shepard's pie.  The server asked if I wanted the Irish cheese on top and even though I'm not a big cheese fan I said yes.  I'm so glad she asked because it was so good taking big fork fulls of the gooey cheese out of the little tin pot it comes in.  The serving itself was quite large and because it was so good I wish I could have finished it.  Even with the human vacuum cleaner with me, we still couldn't get to the bottom of it.  If you order appetizers, the Shepard's pie could be split and both people could be well fed.  I would definitely come back to this place just because of the pie.  Service was really great too.  It was about 60 bucks for the two of us, with tip and drinks without an appetizer.  Well worth the price."
0,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.\n\nDrive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!\n\nReally, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
4,"Excellent service, great food, beautiful restaurant. The waitstaff were incredibly friendly and professional. I felt like a queen. All the meat were soo good, I could not find anything to complain.  The fried bananas were so yummy and the flan dessert was to die for.  Definitely worth every penny!"
3,You can't go wrong with this bagel place. I come here to grab a bag a bagels and go! \nMany different bagels to choose from. You can't go wrong!
4,Krazy Fish is a great place to eat.  The tacos are delicious and have a variety of unique sauce options.  My favorite side item is the jalapeno cheese grits.  There is a brownie for dessert served in a large goblet with scoops of ice cream that is the perfect ending to your meal.  There is a nice large patio area for warmer weather.
0,"First sign of I should have left was no credit card machine. But they do have an ATM they charge you to $2.50 cents to use. Second I ordered the fish and chips and had to pay 55 cents for tartar sauce, I thought tarter sauce should come with a fish n chips meal. All in all very shady charges for a meal not very good. I will not eat here again and I Will tell my friends not to either."
3,"This review is for the rec center side only. It finally dawned on my why I love rec centers so much. While you may not get the \""expert\"" instruction that you get at a pushy gym, the overly aggressive pressure to continue going to class so that your bank account can continue to be leeched is nonexistent in the rec center setting. The teachers I've had here have been nothing but professional, fun and encouraging and because I always feel comfortable I want to come back!\n\nThe Henderson Parks & Rec system is great-variety of centers and classes-but Whitney Ranch has quickly become my new favorite because of its friendly staff and smaller volume of patrons. Most recently I took a Zumba class (with instructor Linda S.) and basic yoga (with instructor Billie). Both instructors were so amazingly kind and really into what they teach-I really looked forward to going to class every week and plan on signing up for both again. Linda S. is SUCH a hoot and takes all of the intimidation out of coordinated dancing and really makes everyone feel comfortable.\n\nThe center is very clean-someone is always cleaning-and barring a children's class letting out, it's generally very quiet. They have a small gym with your basic machines and TVs and also a kind of game room for kids which I assume they use for after school and summer programs.\n\nMy only dings for this place are the nonexistence of paper towels in the bathroom. I get we're trying to be eco-friendly, but it would be great if they could update to a more powerful hand dryer that didn't seem to have lost steam in 1989. Also, they don't have extra yoga mats which I guess isn't a requirement (they tell you up front to bring your own), but the Henderson Multigen Center has them and I guess I'm just kind of spoiled! However all of the good things really outweigh the (not so) bad here and I absolutely recommend this (and other centers in Henderson) if you're looking for fun and stress free ways to get fit!"
1,"If you're in the mood for overly-salted \""Italian\"" food crafted specifically for the purpose of an American tourist palate and appetite, then please, come to Maggiano's Little Italy. It's helpfully located in the Fashion Show Mall as to beckon the tourists who cannot afford or do not know what *real* (and when I say real, I mean decent) Italian food is. \n\nI ventured here with a $25 gift card for lunch. My intent was to have the following: a tasty adult beverage, a soup, and a main dish. Being that one of my favorite Italian dishes (Linguine Clams) was on the menu I knew I would order it. \n\nFirst off I arrived a la solo, which I don't think should be weird, especially for lunch these days. Of course, the hostess attempted to seat me at the bar, to which I declined politely and was lead to a table in the dining area. Impressions: at least it is well-lit during the daytime hours with plenty of windows for viewing the surrounding strip attractions. However, table cloths were rumpled, salt and pepper shakers had a waxy build-up on them. This comes from a restaurant wiping them down with nothing but a damp towel. I should know, I was a server in college. \n\nStarters - I ordered a Peach Bellini and my server brought bread. Sad, pitiful (but at least warm) bread. He did not pour my EVOO (which is on the table), nor did he offer me any balsamic. Yet, as I watched around me, servers plated EVOO and balsamic for THEIR tables. The Peach Bellini arrived in a martini glass. I was disappointed in that, and then even further disappointed that my peach Bellini was not garnished at all and it had no actual fruit in it. It was overly sweet, and not worth $9.  \n\nSoup ($3) - I ordered the Creamy Chicken Potato soup. It was salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. The vegetables were obviously of the frozen variety, and the presentation was horrific. The soup had spilled over the side of the cup and they hadn't bothered to at least wipe it. \n\nLinguine Clams with Red Sauce ($15.95) - This dish should be called Linguine with clams because there was barely a trace of sauce in my bowl/plate. There were so many noodles I thought the waiter had served me a portion for three people. I get it, this is a \""family style\"" place, but for lunch portions also? Also: SALT, SALT, SALT. The dishes here are obviously doctored to an \""Americanized\"" \""Iodized\"" diet. Hefty in portions and in salt. I could barely stomach my noddles and although the clams were decent, there was no \""seafood/brine\"" taste to this dish that SHOULD be there. Comparing this Linguine Clams to others I have eaten (mainly at Chicago Joes downtown), well I just cannot even compare the two. \n\nThey do not make lunch portions. The lunch is just a shortened menu of their dinner. You get ginormous dinner portions and you pay the same amount of money. it's honestly a tourist-trap rip-off.\n\nI am sure the better ratings of this place are coming from tourists. But being a local I can only offer this advice: there are much better Italian places in town. Find them and stay away from Maggianos.\n\nThank goodness I had a gift card."
1,"The food was good but took over 40 mins to arrive to our table; the food didn't justify the wait.\n\nThere were a lot of people there which says other good things about the quality of the food, but this probably didn't help how long our food took.  It looked like there was a single cook working a small griddle."
1,"Everytime i come here theres never bobba! And they take forever to make sandwiches :/ save your money and time, go to the one on eastern and 215."
4,My first two experiences with Chapman were AMAZING.  Having our Jeep serviced at Chapman was a breeze!  The staff is extremely helpful & their services are super fast!!
0,"My wife and I came to Charlotte for a nice dinner at Barrington's but we were extremely disappointed especially with the service.  The food was good but my wife's duck was not prepared as she asked and when we were finally able to get the attention of our server she said that she put the order in for the duck to be medium taking no responsibility for how the duck was prepared and served.  I have had better service at the Waffle House.  In addition the wine was served by over filling the glasses so that she would not have properly attend to our table.   \n\nAttention to detail is what makes a good restaurant great.  Barrington's has a ways to go when it comes to service and attention to detail.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you want a great meal and with great  service as we had expected.   \n\nIn sum, the food would be good if prepared as asked but the service is well bellow what one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber."
2,"pizza cooked at 800 degrees in 2 minutes. great service, atmosphere. reasonable prices but the flavor of my margarita  pizza was just Ok. kind of bland ."
2,"Affordable, close to where I live and has a variety of good pizza options.\n\nI generally go with my gluten-free friend and we order a GF Modesto pizza and an antipasto platter. (If you are extremely sensitive to gluten, I might not suggest the pizza due to cross-contamination.) While the GF pizza only comes in one size, it is enough for two hungry patrons. The antipasto platter is quite filling as well.\n\nThe wait for the pizza was a bit long (or maybe its just for the GF pizza?) the past few times I was there, but drinks are topped up consistently. Servers come by from time to inform us of the wait time / check in on us and they do not give us any hassle with our gluten-free requirements.\n\nThey have daily specials and whatnot, take one of their calendar flyers on your way out."
3,"Went here on a whim, looking for something good and relatively quick to eat. We'd already been to Otto, and the other Italian restaurant in the Square looked overpriced and outdated. \n\nContrary to other reviewers, I actually ended up with great service. The server was attentive, all I had to do was look at her and she came over. Drinks were never left empty, and silverware was replaced between courses. They even brought each dish out split onto two plates without us having to ask.\n\nThe crab cakes were light and fresh, and the creative mix of greens went well with them. The mushroom and leak pizza was good, a little on the salty/oily side but not overdone on the cheese, with a crispy yet light crust. The spring pea angolotti with pea shoots and maitake mushrooms was the highlight, the fresh peas were smoothly textured, the mushrooms added great flavor, great early summer meal. \n\nThe only downside that really stood out to me is the general atmosphere of the faux Italian piazza, but that affects all the restaurants in the area. The Venetian should really invest in improving the acoustics, it gets really loud and hard to hear the person across from you."
0,"I'm not sure if this is the same place... but how many places can there be just off of State Street toward the Capitol claiming a Chicago Style dog? Based on Richard's review maybe this place has new owners, because the hot dog I got there was an insult to my Chicagoan heritage. First, Chicago style hot dogs are made with real Vienna Beef hot dogs, NOT Kosher's Best. Secondly, the relish used at this place is of the Heinz out of a jar variety, not the neon green relish that should accompany a chicago dog. The bun has to be a poppy seed bun. Is it really that hard to do a real Chicago style dog folks? It's not that hard... or is it? Oh, and the girl handling my sausage (he he he), touched my bun (he he he), but really, there were two dogs in the tray, and i ordered one. She removed one by hand (the one she gave to me) after handling money at the cash register, without washing her hands. I wasn't gonna make a stink about it (I guess I am now), but it was noted. Please don't go around claiming something you are not. If you want to say Madisonian reinterpretation of a Chicago dog, okay... but it's not like any hot dog I ever had in Chicago."
4,Love this place. Used to be called Casa Bianca (along with 2 other Casa B locations in Madison which are now closed). Pizza hasn't changed since the Casa Bianca days. Big and Floppy slices. So good.
0,"I hate to do this to a locally owned business but this place was the worst. It was beyond dirty with ZERO atmosphere. The worst part was the dirt though. I had to wipe dust off the table before I put my bag down. After I picked it up, it was still covered in dust. The floor has dirt all over it. I don't think the seating area has been cleaned in months. They had a sign posted that they got an A On a health inspection on 3/26/14. I'm not sure how that's possible. I saw dust in the kitchen area on the counters too. The sandwich I ordered was ok and the staff was nice but I couldn't get past the dirt or stench. Save yourself the time and go to talebu or sozo. I don't know how they've stayed in business this long as it seems these same issues have been brought up in prior posts. (Oh how I wish I would have read them now!) I believe there's also some hoarding as there's an abundance of books, chairs, tables and plants. This place needs a good thorough cleaning and decluttering."
2,I went here for a reception dinner for a friend's wedding and it was amazing! So many items to chose from and the desert options were plentiful.
3,"Good location, lots of parking and lots of space.  Even a little play area for the kiddos.  \n\nI much prefer eating in because there is nothing better than a cheese pizza fresh out of the oven.  WOW.  Having to wait to eat it at home any pizza will lose that oven fresh perfection.\n\nThe wings are great and the pizza is pretty darn good, too.  They go a little heavy on the pizza sauce for my taste, but I will just remember to ask for light sauce next time.\n\nThe place is always busy on the weekends.  And expect to run into teams celebrating a win or licking their wounds for a loss.  But it is still a great atmosphere. And one I am hesitant to take my kid into."
4,"Awesome.  It's different, it's (can be) healthy, it's clean, it's delicious, it's, quick, and it's a great price.\n\nGood spot for sure."
3,"For Vday/Bday, I purchased for my husband a 10 lap combo package with the Lamborghini Gallardo 550 and the Ferrari 430.  Yelpers kept saying that 5 laps were barely enough time to get adjusted to the car and this was repeated by the professionals at the track.  My husband agrees and thinks that the short break you get while waiting for your next car is key, since you sort of need to recover.  He loved it; still talking about it and youtubing race car videos.  I think I've created a problem.\n\nHis instructor for the Lamborghini, Buddy, was incredible.  He was great at talking H through the turns and pushing to give him the best experience possible.  The staff were very professional.  My concerns were immediately and fully addressed.\n\nI don't normally drop money like this, but I did a quick search of other like companies across the States, and they were either about the same amount or cost more.  Another yelper stated it best:  It's unlikely that you're ever going to own one of these cars, and if you do end up with one, you're not going to drive it like this.   It's too crazy an amount to spend, but H got to play fast and furious with a two incredibly powerful cars, while being guided by a professional on a track specifically designed for this purpose.  As a once in a lifetime experience, it's worth it."
1,"Whoa! Je viens de lire des critiques qui disent que la s\u00e9lection des bi\u00e8res est grande?!?! Gi!  Je me demandent o\u00f9 sortent ces gens habituellement?

Les tenanciers de bar signent souvent ce genre d'entente, qui leur permet d'avoir un rabais sur la bi\u00e8re (rabais qui, ici, n'est d'ailleurs pas retransmis au client...) en \u00e9change d'une exclusivit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te ou partielle.  \nCe qui fait que, en mati\u00e8re de bi\u00e8re micro-brass\u00e9es, on a 4 produits de St-Ambroise, et c'est tout!  Et pas les meilleurs, en plus (ils ne pouvaient probablement pas vendre la noire, \u00e7a aurait port\u00e9 ombrage \u00e0 la Guiness, plus ch\u00e8re et DE LOIN moins bonnne).  Aucune IPA,  que de la griffon.... Ouf!  D\u00e9primant!  \n\nQuel dommage, quand m\u00eame, que des petits bars comme \u00e7a ne laissent aucune chance aux petits brasseurs! Il me semble que \u00e7a t\u00e9moigne d'une telle \u00e9troitesse d'esprit!  Il n'y a qu'\u00e0 voir comment se portent les bars qui offrent une bonne s\u00e9lection de bi\u00e8re pour comprendre qu'il y a une demande pour \u00e7a (allez voir un peu \u00e0 quel point l'Isle de Garde est bond\u00e9, jour apr\u00e8s jour!).\n\nFinalement, un joli endroit si vous aimez le mauvais rhum, la mauvaise bi\u00e8re, et Labatt!  Have fun!"
0,"This place is terrible.  I've gone here a few times before today and didn't have the greatest experience but wanted to give it another try.  First off, Maurice, the guy who stands in front and asks what kinda wash you want, tries to upsell the crap out of you.  He wont take no for an answer.  After turning him down 5 times for this $95 package he was trying to sell me he basically looked at me like I was a moron and walked away pouting that I only wanted the $25 hand wash package.  He came back with my ticket and didn't say another word to me.  This package was supposed to be a full wash and clean, inside and out.  After I leave the place I realize not only did they not wipe down anything inside my car, they didn't even give me the air freshener that comes with the package.  Now that I think about it, when I told Maurice for the 5 time I only wanted the $25 package, not the $95 package, he never spoke to me again to ask what kind of air freshener I wanted.  Instead he walked away disgusted that I I didn't go for his sales pitch on the $95 wash.  \n\nI've heard that Maurice actually might be the owner of the place which would be a shame.  This guy will not let you get the wash you want unless you want to risk getting crappy service and a half a$$ wash.  The 2nd time I ever went there he was trying to upsell me to the hand wash.  I asked if it took longer than the regular wash, he said no so I went with it.  As I'm sitting in the waiting room waiting for my car I notice that 3 cars that came in behind me opted for the regular wash and were all done and gone before my car was ready.  This guy will tell you anything to get you spend more money and add on as many upgrades as possible.  I know his job is to try and sell the upgrades but this guy is pushy, rude and basically treats you like crap if you don't do what he wants.\n\nI officially will never be going back to the place and would not recommend that anyone else does either."
4,This is the best place for a couple of slices in all of AZ (period!)
4,I'm here at least once or twice a month.  This place is my go to spot to find stunning dresses to complement my physique.  Lovely staff and great place to shop.
1,"The service was inattentive and slow.  Food took forever to come out.\nThe two other people in my party had some nice steaks, but mine was undercooked and a bit cold.\n\nThe seafood appetizer we had was pretty basic and a deep fried mess.\n\nNothing exciting to see here.  For these prices, go to BOA in Caesars."
4,"Another update...nothing has changed.\n\nStarted and ended my two day journey at Ted's.  First trip I got an Italian, a Bratwurst and an all beef dog.  Topped the sausages with mustard and onions and the all beef dog with mustard, onion, relish and hot sauce.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.   While I was eating, I overheard a conversation a few tables over.  This lady and man asked this group how they liked the food etc.  Turns out, the people asking the questions were one of Teds Grandaughters and the CEO of Teds.  Pretty cool stuff!\n\nSecond trip, I got the United Nations of Sausages........ Italian (Italy), Bratwurst (Germany), and a Polish (Poland).  I got all 3 topped with mustard, onion and hot sauce.  I had an online coupon for free fries too.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.  \n\nI can't say enough about Ted's Hot Dogs.  They are without a doubt my favorite food in AZ and I will continue to come here.  Once I move out here in a few weeks, its going to take some major willpower to keep me away from this place.  They are simply the best!"
0,Meh...clubbing is not my thing. \n\nNice staff.\nBeautiful decor. \nGarbage music. \nCover: Free but I believe it was $20.00 for girls and $40.00 guys.  (not worth it in my opinion...)
1,"Was not impressed.\n\nWe ordered take out and got their family meal ... something like 3 dishes with rice, noodles and egg rolls for around $35.  Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good.  They put way too much corn starch to thicken the sauce (which is normal but the over did it) and the broccoli was waaaay too soggy.  Our egg rolls were over cooked or the oil wasn't clean b'c they were way too dark and had like burnt spots.\n\nMapo tofu wasn't bad.  I asked for non-spicy and they cooked it as requested.  Broccoli beef was terrible - the broccoli was way too soft (and I actually don't mind soft broccoli but seriously, this went overboard) and like I said, too much cornstarch.  I thought the sweet and sour pork wasn't bad but apparently the hubby didn't like it.  Go figure 'cuz I'm the Asian one inthe relationship!\n\nPlaces like these, I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food, I wasn't impressed the least bit ... except for the quantity ... very generous portion!"
0,"AVOID. I went in there to get a flat changed because I was too busy with work at the time to do it myself. First, these people did not even do the repair properly - they returned the bike to me with the wheel installed so poorly that the bike would not even pedal. Second, they knocked my bike around so badly that they broke a bunch of the gear teeth, causing the chain to click loudly with every pedal. Third, when I complained, they tried to tell me (I kid you not) that that the gear teeth had broken because my brake wires were old, and tried to get me to PAY THEM to change the brake wires. Now, as a woman, I am frequently fed BS by male mechanics who assume that I don't know anything about bikes. But this was the most ridiculous line that has ever been tried on me in my life.\n\nShady business tactics and con artistry aside, the astoundingly poor quality of work alone merits avoiding this place. I brought my bike in with a flat and they gave it back to me in worse condition than before - with a jammed wheel and broken gear teeth. That says it all."
0,"Pros: \n- They have groceries.\n- You don't have to drive all the way to 40th and Chandler.\n- You probably won't get killed by zombies while shopping here.\n\nCons: \n- Very limited selection; this is some kind of \""grocery store lite\"". The meat dept doesn't even have ground pork.\n- The produce dept is the absolute pits. Lots of what they put out is bruised and damaged. If it does look OK, trust me when I say that it's one day away from going bad. I've bought so much produce here only to behold a pile of mush the next day.\n- Lots of snotty Foothills biddies who would just as soon step on your face as say \""excuse me\"".\n- The cashiers must be going for some kind of slowness world record. One guy in particular is so slow that I've literally contemplated calling him out on it. He's got to be doing it on purpose.\n- The baggers are inattentive something awful--they'll throw canned goods on top of fruit, chicken in with dish detergent, etc. One time they literally put a six-pack of beer on top of a loaf of bread.\n- The manager doesn't exist. Good luck contacting whomever it is, if you have a complaint."
0,"We were eager to make a return visit to this fish & chips place because my wife enjoy it so much the last time we came to Las Vegas and ate here 3 times.  Unlike that visit though, this time the wait wasn't nearly as long for the food and....perhaps it should have been as the fish were undercooked and something on the slimy side.   Now the fries were quite tasty and crisp, but that wasn't nearly enough to offset the disappointment of crappy cooking, even if the pieces were once again gigantic.      Whether this was a one time screw up on their part or not, it's not likely we'd think about coming here again, as much as we love fish n' chips."
3,"yeah not bad.  very Haight/Ashbury-ish, every corner to this place has got something interesting to look at and observe.  a lot of colorful characters, if you don't mind that sort of crowd.  the guys behind the counter are very cool, the tea was excellent, but the coffee was so-so."
4,Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.
3,"Just in case anyone was wondering... the Italian beef sandwich and hot wings are just as tasty when you take them to go. You know... in case you needed that information. \nI crisped up the waffle fries in the oven when I got home, and it was like sitting there. But without the friendly faces and awesome tap line up."
2,"(A belated review from my visit 2 weeks ago...) Let me start off by saying BLT Steak gets 5-star for service.  The waiter and the manager went above and beyond for our table (what can I say, I was with \""special people.\"" They wanted to play with the wine ladder and the \""kids\"" ended up climbing the wine ladder to get their own wine lol).  I was here before at the bar once and the bartender remembered me... that's amazing considering I have been to places where they couldn't even remember what I just ordered (and it's a girl bartender, not a guy)\n\nThe atmosphere was excellent as well.  Very clean and modern yet just a hint of something romantic/special.  This is a great place for business or personal dining.  \n\nNow to the menu... I wouldn't say it's \""limited\"" but there are little options besides steak and seafood.  I personally ended up having a soup (corn chowder with lump crabmeat) and gnocchi as my dinner.  Our table ordered tuna  tartar and bacon for appetizers as well, and a side of brussel sprouts to share (brussel sprouts was highly recommended by the waiter).  The soup was sweeter than I would have liked but  I enjoyed the crabmeat.  Tuna Tartar was very well presented in a cube shape.  Bacon... well, it's bacon, it's almost impossible to mess up bacon, but not sure if these 3 slices worth $9.  The gnocchi was a little mushy, the taste was fine.  The brussel sprouts was a hit at the table, it's sweet (brown sugar) and savor (bacon... b-a-c-o-n!!!).  Truth is, I can fix a mean brussel sprouts myself so I wasn't as impressed as my fellow diners by it.  I had one bite of the salmon, which was good... but then it's easy to prepare excellent seafood dishes if one starts with premium quality ingredients (and I can only imagine BLT Steak using the best of the best).  Our dessert (chef's special) was a fail; it was too tart, the cookie/cake was too hard.  \n\nI guess what I am hinting is... for a restaurant sitting at the 1st floor of Ritz, I was anticipating more from it.  Granted the service was impeccable, but the best items should not be bacon and brussel sprouts."
4,"This has to be the hidden gem of all gems in Montreal! Don't be thrown off by the sometimes intense host, this is a family owned, authentic greek place so the people working are very passionate about the food.\nOverall, they serve up amazingly fresh, authentic, and organic greek food for an amazing price! As if this weren't good enough, they also have an amazing selection of ready-to-go foods and desserts and a little mini specialty market in the corner of the cafe! Also have great outdoor seating. \n\nLOCATION/NEIGHBORHOOD: Located in the heart of Old Montreal, on a picturesque, cobblestone street the location is prime. It is not on the main, super-touristy square, but it is still on one of the fun streets in old montreal. It is a great neighborhood to go for a walk in before or after your meal (or both).\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR: So this may not be the most modern, or chic of places, but the decor and ambiance are authentic and welcoming. It has a comfortable, homey feeling, and is cute in a casual and comforting way. The decor is very much that of an authentic greek/Mediterranean cottage or restaurant. The ambiance ranges from buzzing and full of life (during peak hours) to quiet and almost romantic during the later hours of the night, or off hours during the afternoon. They have adorable outdoor seating, which I encourage you to take advantage of; the outdoor seating is like sidewalk cafe dining in europe, and is very enjoyable if the weather is being cooperative. \n\nSERVICE: The service is usually prompt and attentive. Both times I have eaten here the server has been very knowledgeable and passionate about their food and about making sure that we are enjoying what we are eating. The first time I ate here I believe we were being served by the owner (he works here all day, every day) and he made us personalized salads that weren't even on the menu according to our tastes (at no extra charge). Both times I ate here they were very accommodating and understanding with my picky eater/vegan requests and made sure that we were having a good experience. \n\nFOOD: Alas, the things that makes Serafim the true gem that it is......the food! Almost everything on the menu is organic and seasonal, but that is just the beginning. The menu is extensive, but you can't go wrong with anything! The options range from such creative mediterranean fair as savory zucchini tarts and bison with wild mushrooms, to traditional kebab plates moussaka, and vegetable tagines. They also have excellent salads and fresh seafood. I am vegan and am obsessed with their vegetable tagine; my mom (who is in no way, shape, or form vegan) tried it the first time I got it and was obsessed. The flavors were so perfectly balance, and the mixture of vegetables, sauce, and chickpeas with rice was perfect; I am salivating just thinking about it! My mom got the vegetarian moussaka and fell in love, she couldn't stop raving about it. We both loved the salads we got as well. The next time I went I got the chickpea salad to go from the deli case and it was delicious! Also go some greek coffee and another order of the vegetable tagine........it is to die for! Honestly though, you can't go wrong with anything you order. The food is authentic, made fresh, and made with love in every bite....sounds cheesy but it's the truth. \n\nSpecial notes: On sundays they have an AMAZING buffet that goes until 8 pm.....if you can make it to this, you will be the happiest person on the planet!"
3,"This is a fun place to eat. They have have great pizza for vegans and non-vegans alike. It's actually rather impressive the large amount of options vegan folk have when ordering a pizza there.\n\nThey also have a great beer selection, in fact I am a member for their \""beer club\"", where you can get prizes for drinking beer. The price for their beer is also very reasonable. \n\nI'm 90% sure all of their crusts are gluten free as well, which is a plus but doesn't matter to me as much as just having yummy vegan goodness.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving the MM 5 stars is it's quality fluctuates a lot. Some days I'll go in and it's great service and food quality, other days I go in and It's ok (never a bad experience yet).\n\nI do recommend the garlic bread, just let them know to make it vegan if that be your preference."
0,"I think this place stinks because of the absolutely horrible service.  Let me explain:\n\nWent there Dec 26th at 7:30PM.  I expected there to be a wait which is no big deal.  However, after standing around for 15 minutes at the counter and having some rude people cut in line to get a table, I went to the front to ask the host where I can write down my name.  He just answered that the wait was 40 minutes to an hour.  He was quite rude and didn't even make eye contact with me.  When I asked how the person that just came got a table, he just repeated that he was very busy.  \n\nThe sushi bar had 5 chairs available so I asked if I could sit there.  He then looked at me and said that there are tons of people waiting.  I look around and there are 3 others.  Oh yeah, there were three others that were waiting before me and when they saw the line cutters get their seats, they left immediately without saying a word.  I on the other hand left using some expletives. \n\nThe fish might be good but I don't need to be mistreated and will take my business somewhere else."
4,I've been doctoring with Dr. Macri since Oct. for a sore arm and shoulder. I feel like I am almost at 100%. She really knows her stuff!
2,"I had no idea what to expect of the restaurant prior to actually going there other than the short blurb about it in our room. We went on a busy Friday night and got in without a wait. The bread guy gets an A+. The sweet bread with olive spread was great. The waiter was ok, I tried to order my flat bread without lamb and for some reason he wasnt having it. It was kind of a weird soup nazi moment about lamb., I was confused. The waiter gets a C for his lamb weirdness. The bartender doesnt have much skill other than pouring stuff for drunk frat guys. I ordered a good Anejo tequila and he threw a lime in it with a sword stuffed through it???"
2,"BIG PICTURE: sub-par\nawful decor (cheap Ikea) and even worse music (Taylor Swfit techno remix)\n\nFood: everything I've ever had here was really good. Including the \""go green\"" martini that the waitress insisted I would not like...weird. it's my favorite summer drink. The rosemary thyme fries are...DIE! \n\nService, kinda sucks, especially when the waiter removes your plate before you have a chance to steal the silverware in your to-go box. \n\nstereotypical gay guys love this place though. I mean c'mon they have like every martini imaginable and it's really clean."
0,Came in at 2:45 on a Saturday afternoon. 3 people working. Not one other customer in the store. Every single table and the whole floor were disgusting. Made me a little scared to venture into the restroom. \n\nProcessed rubbery meat....yuck!!   Go to port of subs where they the meat fresh or firehouse which is just yummy all the around!!!!
3,WOW! so glad you guys found this place.  I go to London  every year and when I'm there I don't pass these things up.  They are soo filling and DELICIOUS!!  The only bad thing about the restaurant was the lack of air conditioning and the kitchen is two feet away from the tables. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND HOT!  but overall TWO THUMBS UP!!
2,"Good variety on the menu (at least as far as non-traditional rolls go ... the deep fried stuff, the gajillion combinations, etc).  Came at a strange time (end of lunch) and service was good.  Sushi was not bad, but not great.\n\nI would say this came across as a reasonable sushi option ... I doubt you'll go truly wrong here, but there are better to be found in South Charlotte."
2,"This past weekend was our first family trip to Scottsdale. We arrived into AZ about 10am, I called to see if we could do early check in and unfortunately the rooms weren't ready. That was fine, when we did check in we got a nice room with a patio. The patio was a shared patio with a view the pool. The bathroom was really small but, other than that it was a fairly nice sized room. The bedding was comfortable. The furniture was not dated and I didn't hear my neighbors through the thin walls as I had previously read. There is free valet parking so on days like Saturday afternoon when the lot was completely full; you just hand your keys over to valet and walk on into the hotel.\n\nThe only true negative is the restaurant inside the hotel is really pricey. The continental breakfast was $18 pp and $9 for a 2 y/o, I mean really what 2 year old eats $9 worth of food? Certainly not mine. I'm lucky if she finishes a complete bowl of cereal so dining there was out of the question.\n\nThe pool area and lobby were my favorite part of the hotel. The lobby is beautiful and  nicely decorated. The pool has a toddler pool which more hotels should make. My little love had an great time splish splashing with the other toddlers. I felt beyond comfortable. They keep the outside pool area stocked with pool towels and plenty of water. While I'm talking about the pool there is a hostess/waitress that comes by the pool and takes food and drink orders. Very attentive, amazing! The bar prices weren't steep at all. You have an option of charging it to your room or paying.\n\nI'm definitely a fan and we will stay here again. Maybe after we stay at the Double Tree! They have a free breakfast. :)"
4,"Unbelieveable hands down the best most unique mexican cuisine that has greaced Phoenix.  These folks know what they are doing. Out of this world flavor, super WOW quantities of amazing flovor packedwith thoughtful combinations of bursting goodness.  This place is the mecca of mexician. get there."
3,"$8 lunch with a flavorful gyro, soda and side.  I really like the small, home feel to the place and the white onions don't bite but add to the flavor.  \n\nThen again, I read Yelp beforehand and knew the Gyro was the choice to make.  Thanks Yelp'ers"
0,"Tests were done without our knowledge or authorization, billed to us without our knowledge, and when we tried to dispute it, the office manager said to pay it or they would send us to collections.\n\nHORRIBLE HANDLING OF OUR ISSUE!"
1,"we came here for breakfast.  I was expecting to be blown away by the food based on the reviews but that wasn't the case.  Although the sitting area was beautiful overlooking the bellagio and passersby, my husband and I were not impressed with our selections.  He got the chicken, Brie, and apple crepe which he said was flavorless.  The crepe itself was nearly empty.  Hecalao asked for fries on the side and ended up getting potato sticks/chips so dont order fries if you're expecting regular fries. I got the three eggs breakfast and my eggs were overcooked and the hashbrowns  were nothing to rave about.  One thing that turned me off immediately and the reason for my 2 star rather than 3 star rating was the distinct eggy/dirty smell that was surrounding us even before we received our meal.  I would pass on this place on my next trip to LV."
4,"I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but the last time I was in Vegas, my bf and I ate here twice! Once for the champagne brunch, and another time just for the breakfast.\n\nChampagne Brunch - What more could you want? It's breakfast, lunch, dessert, and booze. You can stay as long as you want, which means you can drink as much as you want for a great price. The food is good, and if you pass a chip or two to your drink server the drinks will flow freely.\n\nBreakfast - Breakfast for two cost about as much as Starbucks for two. If you in that hung over state of not knowing exactly what it is you need to eat to feel better, this is a good bet. You can have coffee, oj, water, and all the breakfast fare you want. So if you take a bite a something that just doesn't do your tummy right.... no biggie, toss it aside and move on to the next item on your plate.\n\nOverall, Spice Market is awesome.... make a stop for the champagne brunch."
4,This place is amazing. The management must be on point because every single person that works there is so happy. The coffee is very good as well. The line always looks long but it goes fast. The prices are more than far.
2,"Ok. It started out as a rough night . 40 minutes late honoring our reservation, lack of communication from management. Slow service once we did get seated. Our 8:30 reservation was not met with any food until at least 9:30. Really crazy. However, it was made alllll better by our chef, Tito. When we go back and we *will* go back -- we will ask for Tito.  Is he Japanese? No, but he is awesome.   To apologize the manager did comp our entire meal... We were a party of 10 -- and we took good care of our servers...it really wasn't their fault. Happy Xmas eve Tito you know how to do it right. Thanks."
2,"This is the big gambler's PT's.  Lots of big spenders go here.  Problem is with PT's points system.  You have to be a big gambler to benefit... and I'm not.  Food is always decent at PT's but they gyp you on the keno payouts and again, the points aren't generous either.  It feels like the little gamblers are funding the perks for the bigger ones..."
4,"So this was the second ever club I've been to in Vegas.  We went on a Sunday night and I wasn't expecting it to be crackin', but surprisingly it was!.  The crowd was a little older (late 20's early 30's) but that was still cool.  I met about 30 women from Canada that night.  I assume they all came together? haha  The music was pretty good, and the crowd was also pretty good overall.  the club isn't very big but it was decorated very nicely.  Also, with the help of some people everyone in my group was able to get in for free with a little tip.  In the end, all my friends and I had a great time there and I would definitely go there again!"
4,"Favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale! Perfect bagel, good breakfast burrito and warm friendly owners!  Always welcoming!"
1,"I've only experienced a pedicure here, so I can't speak for other salon services offered.\n\nA little over a month ago, I met a friend for pedicures here.  I had called a couple hours prior to make the appointments and was grateful they were able to accommodate us.  We arrived a bit early, and were offered mimosas and to peruse the color selection.\n\nAt our appointment time, we were taken back to two side chairs with copper basins placed at the foot of each, filled with warm soapy water.  I had selected a gelish polish, and was advised against it.  The technician offered to pull similar colors, and I was thrilled with one of her selections; it was the exact shade I was looking for!\n\nIt was a pleasant enough experience.  The technician I had was very chatty, unexpected as my friend and I had wanted to catch up during this time.  My main concern with her chattiness was the continued diversion of conversation to her drunken antics.  But my toes looked nice and my feet were refreshed, so I was pleased...\n\nUntil I wasn't.  While waiting for our toes to dry thoroughly, we were asked to move so they could sit the next appointments.  Although that is understandable, and from my experience the norm, we weren't offered an alternative place to sit.  We shuffled to the front to pay.  Where I was in shock that they charged $48 for a pedicure!  That seemed extreme for a pedicure that didn't offer any luxuries that would have otherwise merited that price.\n\nAdding insult to injury, my pedicure was dingy and tired after 5 days, when it typically takes about 3 weeks for that to happen with my feet.\n\nOverall, I've had much better and was disappointed on many levels with my experience here."
3,"LOVE this place! Amazing food, good drinks, fun atmosphere, and amazing music several nights a week!\nThe crazy lasagna, scallops, or short ribs are my favorites, but truly, you can't go wrong with any choice you make...unless you choose another place to dine."
1,Meh. Went there with a friend to try the alligator. Tasted like over-cooked fry oil.
3,"Our family really enjoys this place. I'm a big fan of the corned beef hash and biscuits & gravy while the kids love the pancakes. My son and I love to sit at the breakfast bar when it's just us. As much as we love this restaurant, there are two things I should also mention. First, most of the wait staff are not as friendly or attentive as I would like. Second, other than the egg white omelette, there aren't great options for those of you looking to eat healthy. Bear fans - you'll love the painting of Dick Butkus."
1,"Didn't care for it.  Expensive, small portions, and mediocre cooking.  Go a few blocks west to Saigon Pho if you want the real thing.  But this place is prettier, whatever that's worth to you."
2,"The Fry bread itself is fantastic.  Too bad everything Emerson puts on it isn't.  It's not bad, but there's nothing special about it.  No seasoning.  No sauce.  Just a pile of bland mexican food tossed on top of the bread.\n\nEmerson is a regular at Food Truck Friday, and appears to have fans all over the valley.  I suggest hitting up the truck for a good snack, but avoid the meals."
4,"Had read some great reviews on here before trying it out myself. It's location is what I had looked for, because its not too far from Central and quite easily accessible by bus (yea, I ride it). \nBeing it was my first time I definitely got to take advantage of the first time price, which is a GREAT deal! But I ended up having her do more while I was there so I ended up paying for the actual cost of the Brazilian (why I went there). \nI was penciled in with Amy and she was great. All the staff was very friendly and easy to have a conversation with. Amy was very gentle and I would definitely head back there."
2,"Cutest little sweets shop! Love the d\u00e9cor, particularly the drink station with simple syrup, vanilla and hazelnut add-ins, and old-school sugar cubes. Staff was polite as well, Christmas tree decked out in baking-motif ornaments was a nice seasonal touch.\n\nCame in for coffee and macarons, and the cherry-chocolate and cherry-nutella were both amazing! Unfortunately, the other flavors were quite dry and crumbled apart- perhaps I came too late in the day?\nCoffees were made fresh but unfortunately had a burned taste to them that I disliked, BF inhaled his but only ever drinks it straight black, so maybe it's just a preference."
1,"Here is my summary of Streets of NY:\n\n1) Greek salad-4 stars\n2) Italian wedding soup-4 stars \n3) Pizza-1 star.\n\n\nI've been to NY and this is not NY style pizza. Regardless of that, it simply isn't good. It reminded me Pizza Hut. Do not order the soup if you are on a low sodium diet. The delivery was prompt which was good....I guess."
0,"I do not fly domestic enough to know what is the Standard. So take that with a grain of salt.\n\nI will not fly US airways again. Overall just unhappy staff. Never got a smile once from any of them. Guess they think \""customer service\"" doesnt include friendliness. Whatever.\n\n$25 to check any baggage. wow. ok So we only check one. We then arrive at the terminal. we are \""zone 5\"" meaning, last to board. I ask if they offer any \""infant boarding\"" such as all international flights do. They do not.\n\nThey must have asked us a total of 4 times: \""Do you want to check your baggage?\"" ..*um no.. we dont, Thats another $25 in your pockets for something I can just carry on.* On the 4th time, I just stared at the guy at the counter like *Are you F'ing Serious?* Then shook my head and said \""no, we do not want to.\""\n\n3.. Yes 3 Minutes later they announce that all remaining carry on's must be checked.. FOR FREE.  lol Thanks guys. Real nice work.\n\nI got an isle seat. Somehow it was broken, so I am slouching toward the isle for 2 hours. No Belt buckle for Infant on lap, such as International Flights require during turbulence.\n\nFlight attendants were ok, but again no smiling other than making eye contact with my infant son.\n\nThen of course 20 minutes before landing, they advertise to us some ridiculous deal about a flight to hawaii if if you sign up for their credit card. They announced this 4 times over the speaker.\n\n\nI will not fly this airline every again. Why? Bad Customer service, and a constant desire to get their customer to spend more money on their airlines."
3,"I am new in town on temporary work assignment from ATL and sat at the bar here for lunch the other day.  I got a chopped side salad, roasted salmon entree with fried green tomatoes, and asparagus for my sides.  The service was awesome and the bar was clean.  The food was special and I really enjoyed the ambiance.\nWill be back often."
4,Best pedicure in all of Vegas! Ask for Liliana and callus remover. Definitely get the 60 minute package! Relaxing and feels wonderful. It's my second time here and I will definitely be back again!
2,Hamburgers were great - onion rings were very bland - fries were great.. But greasy.  Service was great and timely - but the sound level was extremely - extremely loud (don't understand why-place was only 1/2 full..)
2,"Well, came in to try out the Reuben sandwich. The name itself sounds pretty good. It came to the point that I was a little disappointed. I wanted my sandwich hot and guess what I got? Warm sandwich. The corned beef and Swiss cheese was already prepped in their fridge. I was expecting fresh cut from the deli machine. The sauerkraut came from a small packet, not fresh. The guy probably only toasted the bread for a minute so it's not toasty. The corned beef was a little salty for my opinion. Definetely not getting that again. \nOn the other side, you get a small side order of anything as long as $7.99 and below. I got the cucumber and tomatoes that was soaked on oil ( not sure what kind of oil) so it was kinda mushy. I didn't really liked it but I ate it coz I was hungry lol. \nI think the best part was the small dark chocolate that they give you for free. I love dark chocolate so that's a plus. \nOverall, was ok. That sandwich cost me $9 doesn't come with any drink. Oh well!"
0,"2 large cokes for almost $5 !?!?\n\nHell with you, czar of sirloin!  I'm going to McDonalds, Carl's Jr or QuikTrip from now on."
3,"The woodshed was a surprisingly nice place.  We stopped by on our Tempe Dive Bar Tour, and I actually found it to be the most aesthetically pleasing, although it was one of the last stops so there may have been some drunk goggles going on.\n\nAt the time we were there they had $3.25 32oz domestics which is a pretty damn good deal.  There is a narrow bar area, and some other seating area around with the normal realm of darts, pool, and other bar games.\n\nPeople are friendly and service is pretty quick.  I didn't eat any of the food, but I wouldn't be surprised if I found myself in this bar again."
3,"This shop came highly recommended and they didn't disappoint. The staff greeted us as soon as we entered the door. That's always a plus, otherwise I take my business else where. Ecceltic looking shop on the inside, but it's very clean. Steve did a nice elemental ambigram for my daughter. This is where I'll come from now on in Vegas...finish up my \""bakers dozen\"" for my tats.\n\nBig Daddy O"
3,"Yesterday, we wanted to try something new for lunch..  We were in the mood for a good salad and my friend did a search and Zooks was on the list.  We headed over and in my mind knowing where this was located, I dreaded the parking situation I was going to find.  Luckily, the parking wasn't bad because we went at 1pm, but we did get the last spot that we had to squeeze into.  A truck would never fit.  Anyway, we walked in and the atmosphere is pretty fresh and clean with bright colors and images of fresh veggies adorning the walls.  Pretty nice.   When you walk up to the counter, a pretty nice guy greeted us and asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he explained the menu to us.  We went right for the salads, even though some of the sandwich options looked pretty good. I got the #5 and an iced tea.  \n\nWe took our seats and one thing that stuck us as a little odd was that the AC system was over the windows but the air was so forceful it didn't matter where you sat in the dinning area, you were going to be blasted.  Not a huge deal, but it was noticeable.  It's Arizona and it's hot, so I guess we should be thankful.  \n\nOnce we got our meal, it came in a plastic to-go container.  One thing I might recommend to them is using something less environmentally unfriendly and costly for people who are dinning in.  I mean it seems very \""pre-packaged\"" and not to mention it's totally crappy for the environment, but I digress.... The salad was full of wonderful ingredients, crumbled bacon, roasted almonds, dried cranberries, apples, carrots, and Zookz Creamy Apple Mustard Dressing.  It was so good, it left me wanting more.  (Meaning it was great, but it have had more to it or at leas greens at least.  They should bottle that dressing for sure, though because it was awesome! \n\nThis is a great place to grab lunch so check them out.  I think I definitely want to try a sandwich next time.  Maybe split it with my friend and have the salad again too.  I hope to see them fix the way they package their salads so when you dine-in you aren't getting it in a to-go container. Heck, it's going to save them money in the long run anyway."
1,"I feel like a total hypocrite giving this place a low rating, but then coming here at least 3 times a week. The reason? Laziness on my part. And terrible weather that makes me want to get home as quickly as possible, so I go to the nearest supermarket each time, even though every single time I go there I know pre-emptively they won't have half the ingredients I need for my Good Food recipe I'd spent an hour deciding upon on my lunch break, and then having to make something up on the spot from the three ingredients I can find, and then the time it takes to queue to get my groceries I realise I could have walked to a different supermarket.\n\nYeah I'm lazy.\n\nIt's convenient. It's close to my gym. It's close to the coffee shops I work in. The staff are all young and nice enough but are obviously just doing it as filler and don't really care. Really long queues. Not much choice. Really expensive (over \u00a310 for my vegetables each time).\n\nThey didn't even have POPZ when I went in last night."
0,"Our family used to be regulars here until our last experience, which was on August 8, 2014. My son and I decided to have lunch and we ordered our usual appetizers, meals, and drinks. While munching on our apps, my son pointed out a 2.5-3 inch cockroach crawling on a wall behind me. I notified the owner/manager and he walked over and stomped on in and said I was all set.  As you can imagine, our appetites vanished! I will never be back...I have contacted the health department and do hope that they do something about this before someone gets sick."
4,"Finally visited the restaurant, and I can confidently say this is as good as it gets for Mexican food in Las Vegas.\n\nYou start with chips, bean dip, mild salsa. There are 10 different levels of spicy salsa that you can choose from, a habanero salsa being the hottest. Service with a smile, a mariachi in the background (with a great voice, no less), and 22 oz margaritas make this place a go-to.\n\nStarted with the nopales con cebollados - cactus strips with fried onion. Served with corn tortillas, was delicious. Split the shrimp ceviche salad which was excellent and filling, and also split the steak fajitas. Delicious, served with guac, sour cream, rice, beans, flour torts. A meal for two with two drinks apiece, two apps, fajitas for two came out to $85 with tip. A bargain!"
0,"I went in to Paper Joy this past week and I have to say  it was the worst experience in my life.  I'm not sure if the owner saw us pull up in a beat up truck and me walk in with my mom and neice and nephew, and assumed we were poor and I was un-wed with two kids!!  Or if she is just this rude to everyone.  I walked into the small cramped space and was ignored, so I started looking around.  She has a few examples of invitations on her back wall, so I started to look at those, I was not impressed.  I finally went over to her desk and she finanlly asked if we needed help.  I told her I just got engaged and wanted to see some examples of invitations and save the dates, and she told me I had to make an appointment.  There wasn't anyone in the store, she was very rude, and I could tell she was passing judgment on us.  She must not have seen the rock on my finger! Sure my parent's don't have a lot of money, hence the beat up truck we pulled into the parking lot in.  But my paren't aren't paying for my wedding.  My fiance and myself are, we are getting married at the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago (I was visiting family in AZ and wanted to involve my Mom in some of the planning).  If she wasn't so judgemental and allowed us to look through some examples we may have used her, all though I wasn't impressed with the few examples she did have on her wall!  She has no idea what my budget was and if she did know I'm sure she would have treated us better, but to be honest I wouldn't want to give someone like that my buisness.  Make sure you make an appointment before stopping in this place, and make sure you are dressed to the nines so she doesn't think your money is worthless in her store.  BTW - her webiste says appointments are preferred, not necessary!  No thanks!"
0,Called a cab about an hour ago and was told 10-20 minutes.  20 minutes ago was told 17 minutes.  Using my cell phone's last remaining battery life to leave this 1 star review.
2,"it's just an okay restaurant, to be honest. tastes nothing like the home country, but I guess it's the best we can do.\n\nambiance: 3 - just okay, but it sometimes smells like cleaning agent, which is a turnoff. there is limited seating, but thankfully not a long line.\n\nservice: 4 - preparation is pretty fast, but they can be a bit slow when taking orders.\n\nfood: 3 - halo halo is pretty okay, for which I grant this place two stars. for breakfast I had tocino and bangus. it was pretty disappointing because the tocino was pretty tasteless, and that's my favorite. they should really consider cooking and buying fresh foods instead of frozen foods.\n\nI say that because the tocino from seafood city, next door, is 100x better than this!"
1,"Burned by Addiction yet again! My mom wanted to come here for her birthday and because she is an incredibly picky eater, I conceded after offering her many other restaurant options of which I knew we'd have a substantially better eating and service experience. After leaving dinner my mom told me I could pick the restaurants from here on out. She said she trusted me. Sometimes it takes just having the bad experience all up in your face!\n\nOur waitress was nice, but inattentive not out of laziness but because she was the only waitress there and I'm sure waitressing was not her only job duty. The food was meh-everything fell flat and presentation was deeply disappointing and unsatisfying. I ordered the parmesan fries and french onion soup and my mom ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu and also got french onion soup, a salad, seared ahi and a sundae. \n\nI feel like if a restaurant is going to offer a classic dish like French onion soup, they either better put their own spin on it or it better be the best of the best. This version was neither and I think they tried to hide this fact with an unforgivable amount of salt. The cheese was neither melted nor hot-just a slice of some identifiable cheese that at one point been melted but was now sitting as a thick, unappetizing layer on top of the soup. Underneath it was a slice of what appeared to be wheat bread. It had soaked up the liquid of the soup and was soggy and again, unappetizing. The broth's only minimally redeeming quality was the abundance of onions, but that was overpowered by a broth that was so offensively salty, that if I had hypertension I'd be writing this review from my grave.\n\nThe rest of the food was mediocre at best- my mom nailed it when she said my fries tasted like Jack in the Box fries, which I like! But I could've paid $2 for those instead of $6. Presentation was bad on her ahi and it should've been served with some starch-possibly polenta or potatoes-in addition to the salad. \n\nI don't want to keep bashing the place because it has potential. The food needs work and the restaurant operations could definitely use a boost a la Restaurant Impossible. Being the only restaurant at Rumor, they really need to either step their game up and invest in better quality food and additional staff or shut the restaurant down completely and use the space for something else."
0,"I went in for a manicure before a big event and came out SO disappointed - worst manicure I've ever had. \nThe experience didn't get off to a really good start with not many colors even being available for me to choose from. \nAs the manicure commenced, it was very sloppy and I wasn't impressed with the lack of detail my nails were given. At the end, I just wanted to pay and get out. \nAND That wasn't even the end of it. After I paid and walked out, I realized my manicure was completely jacked from pulling out my wallet and paying. Come to find out, I could wipe off all my nail polish in one swipe of a finger... the lady put oil as a base on my nail... \nI didn't have time to go back in as I was already running late, hence no time to argue for a refund. That was my first and last visit."
0,"Art is not trustworthy.  His mechanic broke something on my car (Not Tom, Tom is a very good guy and excellent mechanic.) and then got very angry with me when I actually (gasp) expected him to repair it!  The next time I came in he treated my wife and I very poorly. We started going through all our bills and realized he'd been overpricing us for years. After finding a better mechanic we were told we'd paid for things, fixed and replaced things we never should have.  We expected better after taking our cars there for eight years.  Art is a scheister taking advantage of poor older folks and families who don't know any better.  Do NOT trust him!"
4,"Not sure how drunk the negative reviewers were but I have been coming here 3-4 times per year and have had wonderful experiences. \nFriendly helpful staff, great location, comfortable beds and accommodations, reasonable pricing, free internet and calls, no resort fees, and on and on. Ck them on your next visit."
3,We stopped by for a quick bite to eat. i was told to come try the tacos.  its a really cute but very small place.  Clean and organized.  Very good salsa bar.  The seven chili and mexicana salsa were my favorite.  We ordered queso fundido...i liked it. One of my favorite dishes to try at new places. It did not dissappoint.  Only bad thing was...they could have given a few extra pieces of tortilla with the queso.  We tried the guacho and white fish tacos.  The guacho was excellent.  The white fish wasnt anything special.  Needs some extra seasoning or maybe a spicier sauce instead of the cabbage and white sauce.  I would come back and new stuff because i was pleased with my first try here.
1,"I'd put this at about 1.5 stars, but am rounding up.  I was coming out to Vegas and had 3 nights booked at New York New York.  I had a last minute opportunity to come to Vegas 2 nights early, so I decided to look at hotel options.  Seeing that the Las Vegas hilton's price dropped from 299/night to 104/night at the last minute..I decided to help them fill the hotel.  \n\nThe hotel - I realize that this is the Las Vegas strip, and everything costs extra...but I really felt nickled and dimed at this hotel.  From the 3.50 bottled water at the pizza hut (4.00 in the room), to the 13.99/night internet, to the 6.75 bottles of beer at the bar.  The bright spot was the free parking, though that seems to be fairly standard out here.   The star trek experience was closed down... which was disappointing even though I'm not a trekkie.  The location of the hotel is not ON the strip... It's either a short walk, or a monorail ride away.\n\nAs a hilton diamond member, I received a room \""upgrade\"".  Apparently the upgrade only gave me a bigger tv, and a more comfortable bed.  Considering the VERY limited channel selection, the big tv was rather pointless...though the bed was quite cozy.  (I guess the big tv might be nice if you decided to rent movies to watch) If you are a hilton gold or diamond member, make SURE to bring your hiltonhonors card along.  Without it, you don't get your free breakfast buffet, or free fitness center access.  (Even if they already have your number on file)\n\nThe room - I liked the great water pressure in the shower.  I also thought the \""hydraulic toilet seat\"" was a nice touch.  However, the negatives outweighed the positives.  The shower was designed for midgets.  The showerhead was literally at chest height for me... and I'm only about 6 feet tall !!!!.  Squatting while showering is NOT a comfortable experience.   The weather was rather chilly during my stay, and the heater didn't work worth a darn.  It literally took about 5 hours to get the room to a comfortable temperature with the heat cranked to maximum.  The windows were so dirty that it looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years.  I realize that dust blows around in the desert, but it certainly shouldn't be THAT bad.  Add in the long wait for elevators in my tower, and it made the entire experience less than desirable.  Thank goodness I'm headed to another hotel, and am not relying on this place for my entire stay."
0,I used to be a huge fan of tropical smoothie. The service at many of them has been awful. May just go back to exclusively making my own smoothies from now on.
2,"I've only been to the Rose Bowl on one particular night, Tuesday.  They have bluegrass music.\n\nI don't know about any other night, but Tues there are quite a few laid-back grad student types.  It's always been fun, pitchers are cheap.\n\nIt's dark and has a dive bar feel.  The only food available is tater chips."
3,Good spicy pork taco and lengua.open late night.  Avocado cream sauce delicious.
2,I eat here a couple of times a month. Take out is fast and good size portion. The food is cooked when ordered so it is fresh and hot. Scallops have sand so I avoid anything with them. Everything else is recommended.
1,"My friend and I had lunch at Bink's on a Tuesday.  I was specific with the server that I am vegan.  She made some recommendations and assured me that certain dishes could be made without meat or dairy.  I ordered the corn soup which she recommended and it came out with pieces of chorizo in it.  Our other selections came out in no particular order and not at the same time.  We had to flag down our server for the ice tea that was ordered upon arrival.  Poor service, lack of attention to detail and average food.  It's a pretty restaurant but not very satisfying."
3,The cheese curds are glorious!!! Reminds me of Midwest food and the service is good. Great place to watch football games and have a good time
1,"We wanted to try Blue Wasabi since it's located near our home and I had heard about it from friends.  If you're a big fan of sushi, this is not the place for you.  The sushi was mediocre...while they cleverly name their sushi, they don't deliver the quality and prices were slightly higher than usual.  The atmosphere is very Scottsdale-esqe, and could be fun if you and your girlfriends were going out for drinks as their martinis were awesome.  \n\nThey should nix the Sushi and simply be a martini bar."
0,"I don't understand how this place has gotten so many good reviews. The food was awful. I had the Biscuits and Gravy with sides of sausage and toast. The biscuits and gravy had a weird aftertaste, which I think one of the 5 star reviewers describes as \""unique\"". To each his own I guess. I had to drink an entire glass of iced tea to wash it out of my mouth.  The Crackers Country Potatoes were another disaster. The crispy parts were hard as stone, impossibe to eat, and it was almost cold. A plate still full of food should be a concern for any restaurant, but I was given my check with out question.\nDo yourself a favor and skip this restaurant."
3,"These guys have always taken good care of my car.  I've been coming to them for 3 years, and only one time did they miss something.  Their prices aren't bad either.  They usually have specials during the week when it's slow."
3,I am a total fan! I came in 10 minutes before close (sorry employees!) and they were still super nice to me. I love their selection and I cant wait to go back and buy wine. \n\nThis trip I was picking up torani syrups because i'm on an italian soda kick. They had so many great flavors! my current fav is peach :)   I totally need to take advantange of their .05c wine sale one of these days...\n\n\nGetcho booty patooty over there.
1,"2.5 stars.\n\nIt's overpriced -- the most expensive buffet we had thus far -- and the food wasn't good!!!!!! We went for breakfast, how can you mess that up? But you can. They had LOTS of food, tons of variety, rows and rows of food that looked like they could be good, but when you put it on that plate and sit your butt down and grab your fork....\n\nI just can't give it three stars. They got the extra half for the service. Go somewhere else for breakfast - $23 apiece?! ;( Vegas has gotten pricier, but they should step up their food options, though I suppose compared to their super expensive restaurants in the MGM, $23 is quite affordable."
0,"Alright, I admit, this is not my type of crowd or environment and that's part of the reason for the low rating.  Hey, you do it for the Scottsdale bars - so leave me alone!\n\nOur group headed here after Oktoberfest for a few drinks, and after finding a long wait for Rula Bula we ended up here where it was pretty dead.  Inside, there were a bunch of older creeps creeping on the scantily clad bar staff.  Outside, it was cramped and stinky of smoke.  The service at the bar was just okay....not particularly friendly or fast.  \n\nI wouldn't return here because I'm not in college and I'm not an older creep.  If out on Mill, I'll stick to Rula Bula."
2,"This is a standard restaurant for us. A staple in our rotation. A \""it's convenient\"", \""it's reasonably priced\"", \""the happy hour is good\"", \""I'm not craving anything in particular\"", \""let's just do something easy and casual\"" restaurant.\n\nIt's a good place. It's just not a great place. Everything is pretty solid. But nothing is exceptional.\n\nThe bartenders are very nice and helpful. They will give you a free sample taste of any of the draft beers. And it's a decent list of beers.\n\nThe service has always been good. Even when it is crowded and very busy, we've never had any issues with the service here.\n\nOne of my favorite go-to items on the menu is the bernaise sliders. The sliders themselves are very good. Good burgers and good buns. The bernaise sauce comes on the side. It is definitely not your standard bernaise sauce and would never hold up on a steak. But on a burger, this particular bernaise is delicious. The shoestring fries that come on the side are also great. Just the right amount of crispiness and salt.\n\nThe pizzas have also always been pretty good. Along with most of their menu items.\n\nThe wings, though, have been somewhat of a let-down. They are your typical cheap tavern wings, except they aren't cheap. Poor quality meat and not that meaty. The firecracker wings have a great sauce. Very saucy and flavorful. The buffalo wings, though, while there is a decent flavor to the sauce, is a very oily sauce. The ranch dipping sauce is well above average and pairs nicely with the wings.\n\nThe atmosphere is ok. The space and decor works. It's definitely a family-friendly place, often filled with strollers and small children. The bar area can be quite full during happy hour. Seems to be popular with both tourists and locals alike.\n\nIf you are expecting culinary greatness, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a decent lunch or dinner after a couple of hours of shopping or before hitting a movie, this place will hit the spot. And the happy hour deals are great."
3,"I went ot Lolo's this weekend with the Breakfast Club (thanks Monica!). It was, of course, a fun time, and the food was pretty good. I, of course, had chicken and waffles (what else?). I got the Betty Boop, which was a breast and a waffle. My waist line is not thrilled, but I was! The chicken was good, it had a good amount of crunchiness, but I wish the breading had more spices in it. A good way to fix that is using their delicious hot sauce. Surprising, the coffee here was very good as well. I will probably not come here often (my thighs can't afford it), but when I'm looking for a breakfast calorie splurge, this is a good place to go. \n\nPS our server was very nice and accommodating for our large group."
0,"Idiots cant cook a steak to save their lives. on my third visit I told the manager about my previous over cooked steaks before I ordered. My steak came out well done again. The manager delivered it to me personally. Idiots! If your going to post a \""cooking Legend\"" on your menu to describe how your steak will be prepared maybe show it to the cooks first."
3,"Kudos to this location for pulling of a great fundraising event for my sons elementary school. I only attended this location because my son's school used them for a fundraiser. 10% of the sales were being donated to an elementary school. I opted to park and dine in because it has an indoor play ground. The parking lot is pretty small. They share a lot with a plaza which has at least 2-3 more stores. The drive through access is a little awkward, but what fast food place isn't now-a-days. \n\nAnyway, upon entering I initially thought long line, long wait. Well, they had workers stationed all throughout the restaurant to offer assistance which was very helpful. I was able to find a table for my family and the manager made sure to bring my food which is not usual for a fast food place. I was impressed. There was not much moving space in the dining area. I am not sure if they added more tables because of the event or not. There was staff always visible cleaning and assisting the guests which was great. The food quality was good. They got my order correct and it was still hot when I was eating it."
0,"When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time. After speaking to the manager, we decided to try it out. I placed an order for a less spicy pico de gallo and when it came it burned the roof of my mouth. I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla! Normally love Mexican food but am for sure going to skip this place next time."
0,"Holy shit this place is hilarious. The food is overpriced, the portions are tiny, and the taste is too salty. The only upside is that the food came out pretty fast but only 3 parties were here. Don't come here"
1,"Sometimes I eat at a 'chain' and wonder how it even got past the original restaurant. Jimmy Johns joins that list. Went today and got a number 11, which is off of the deluxe or some-such side of the menu, the hook being 'twice the meat' and so on. What I got, if twice anything, well, glad I did not get the regular. It was mostly a bread and lettuce sandwich. The french roll was good, but that was it. Really an unremarkable sandwich. I can't see ever going back. I don't even care that much for Port o Subs and Subway, but either of those is way better than this."
4,"Great place!!\n\nWe came here with a group of 7 for dinner around 9:00pm on a Tuesday. Our server and all the other servers were very attentive. Our server had very good knowledge with the menu and was helpful and willing to answer any questions. \n\nI got the scallops and they were delicious!! They had a delicious sauce with them and were cooked perfectly. Everyone's plates came out in a timely manner, and they were all played beautifully. The queso fundido was also very good that we got as an appetizer! \n\nI would definitely be back and want to try different things on the menu! :)"
2,Bruschetta and salads were ok. Service was friendly and attentive. Would like to explore more of the menu but worth a visit.
1,"We came on a Tuesday evening and ordered a 10oz Juicy Lucy burger, american cheese, lettuce, grilled onion and mushrooms, bbq sauce with a fried egg for the sides, french fries and mozzarella sticks. We used a 12 for $25 groupon plus 4 bucks. \n\n- 3 MOZZARELLA BALLS for $7? ROBBERY! tasted like something that came from Smith's frozen food and put it on a nice plate. \n- 6 bucks for french fries. at least 2 people can share it. again, nothing special. tall and thin. crispy.  \n- They won't cut the burger for you. No extra knives. Henry's Burger's is way better and they give you 2 patties. But with honesty,  overall the burger was good. It was cooked well done. I was hoping for a bit red, especially for gourmet style.\n- I don't even know why we tipped. the watiress didn't help us for nothin. we took our own order. All she did was hand us our food and gave a check. The bus boy was the one that refilled our drinks. \n- Even with the Groupon deal, it was theft! Don't come here. The counter is a better recommendation.  \n\n:("
2,This place is definitely a dive but I can't say its not delicious. The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else. The fried zucchini is also awesome. Service and food is great but the atmosphere could use some work.
4,"Frost Bites hits the West side and I couldn't be happier. My first trek to visit them all the way on Boulder Highway was great, but having them on my side of town made giving them a another shot necessary. \n\nEven better than the first try. I tried the coffee with strawberries and chocolate sprinkles and my mom got the strawberry with strawberries. It was the perfect treat on this very hot summer day. Smooth and flavorful and yet still light and not too overly sweet. The perfect combination of flavors and texture. I can't wait for them to make their way to the best side permanently!"
3,"I am a pho fan and theirs is more than fair! Flavorful spring rolls with peanut sauce, tender orange chicken, and a delicious house-made coconut water!\nGo and enjoy!"
4,Not much to say other than the FREID CHICKEN with honey and hot sauce. No questions just order it!
0,"Thank you for deleting my review because it shines the light on how terrible this hospital is, Luckily - I have it saved so I can paste it as many times as I'd like, and have shared with everyone I know to avoid this horrific establishment: \n\n\nAbsolute Garbage. Worst hospital I've ever witnessed in action.\n\nMy father fell and fractured his hip.\n\nDay 1:\nthey withold my father from eating as they say hes going to have surgery that day\nwe keep asking, nurses have no idea when he's having surgery\nlunch rolls around, dinner rolls around, still no food and still no surgery (He has low blood sugar, diabetes, and is 74)\nat night they say they realize it wouldn't be able to happen that day, tell him and ask if he wants dinner (which took another hour to be delivered to him).\nMy mom took off work, which cut into her schedule and really screwed us over.\n\nDay 2: surgery scheduled for 3 pm.\nmom gets off work early, we get here at 2 and wait. (Granted I have school, she took off more time for work, and my dad's going without food again)\n\n3 doctor rolls on in, states some genius had a hole in their glove and contaminated all the work equipment which would take an hour to fix. 4 pm rolls around. 5 pm rolls around. 6 pm rolls around. We ask every hour what in hell is going on, still receive no information - at 6, we finally learn that an emergency case came in and they used the room which they had prepped for my dad, and said it would be another 20 minutes.\n6:30 rolls around. they come in tell us another 20 minutes.\n7:15 rolls around. my dad is raging, and we're trying to calm him down but he hasn't eaten all day and is in a lot of pain - I don't blame him for being pissed at this horrendous system they call a hospital.\n7:30 rolls around and they finally get him in, but I forgot to mention the nurses who all gathered his information all went home (boy lucky them) so we got some potato head genius's who roll in asking all the same questions, which just makes this situation feel even more smooth.\nAll in all, this is the biggest joke of a hospital experience I've witnessed.\nIf I was there for the first day, I would have had him transferred to another hospital.\nSurprised my mother didn't. If I was there the first day, I would have probably exploded at the staff about how incompetent they were.\n\nwould not recommend anyone with a sick or injured family member to come here. we came here because it was closer, but next time will definitely tell ambulance or whoever to take the injured person out of their way to banner baywood or banner desert.\n\nPROS:\n- friendly nurse staff\n-clean environment\n-good hospital food\n\nCONS:\n-terrible communcation skills (Between staff and staff-to-patient)\n-horrible bedside manner in shift transition (potato heads waltz in asking redudant questions with a cheeky smile on their face when we've waitied for days and are irate beyond belief. how about some communication if you don't feel like getting yelled at).\n-awful time management and design scheme, how about we make patients wait for days when they have conditions that could put their life in danger if they don't eat.\n\nI would give this place a 0 for their service, and a negative score for trying to hide my review. Disgusting."
3,"Walking into Leroy Fox, it has white washed wooden walls, it's lovely, it reminds me of JCT in Atlanta.  Nice people, everyone smiled and said hello.  I ordered a bloody mary and a shrimp po' boy.  My friend ordered a starter of pretzel bites.  The server said she didn't really like pretzels that much, but she loved these.  I hear ya sister.  When they arrived, they were little fried pretzel nuggets, with ranch, cheese dip and honey mustard for dipping.  I am a sucker for condiments.  Yay!!  Pretzels good.  \n\nMy sandwich was a great size portion and the shrimp were fried and hot, my french fry barometer registered a \""wicky, wicky woooooow.\""  So I was happy, the one thing that I was not pleased with was my $10 dollar bloody mary was supposed to have a shrimp garnish, I didn't get the shrimp skewer, so I was hoping I had a $5 bloody mary, but I still had a $10 on my check, WAH!!!!  I hate $10 cocktails in the daylight.  Day drinkin' should be a bargain.  \n\nThey do have really cute American Apparel t shirts, (with Vixen, sly fox and Leroy fox) you can pick one up for $20. And they are garnished with a shrimp skewer!"
1,"This is the 3rd Roy's I've experienced and to be completely honest, I was not too impressed... Although the complimentary valet is a nice feature, our reservation was pushed to the right by 10 min. Our dinner took over an hour before it made it to our table."
0,"Straight and to the point--- This place is extremely expensive ($3 for a bagel and cream cheese???), the staff are a bunch of slow moving \""bros\"" who got chin strap facial hair and more product in their hair than in their store. We ordered 2 bagels with cream cheese. Waited about 15mins for a cream cheese bagel?????? Skimped on the cheese big time and messed up one of bagels. .....don't go there. It wasn't busy, so NO that isn't an excuse."
3,"Every detail was covered, from a rich broth of miso soup with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. He was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. The interior is contemporary Japanese and beautiful. And the food was fantastic.\n\nWe had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\nTuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nBlue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nAnd the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. It makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\nInterestingly, I've been to other Nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. I don't know why, but that seems odd."
0,Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. \n\nI was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. \n\nI see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! \n\nSo I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. \n\nSo how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.\n\nI worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! \n\nFYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.\n\nNo value means lost customers ....
4,"WOW such an amazing place!!! Everything is made with love you can both see and taste. Chef John is a master of his craft. Crispy pork nuggets...... Heaven on a plate! Gotta come here. Breakfast , lunch , dinner.... It's all tasty."
1,"met some friends here for lunch last week and had never heard of the place.  Upon walking in i was PLEASANTLY surprised!  The name \""twin peaks\"" finally made sense and i was greeted by 7 girls wearing VERY not much, and that was nice!\n\nthe place was full of big screen TVs with all different sports on so that was nice.  the burgers were decent and the price wasn't too bad, but the waitresses were defiantly the best part!"
0,"They suckered me in with the $10 oil change.  However, for this price they do not use a grade of oil recommended for any engine.  \n\nI knew I needed new brakes so they talked me into a $200 brake job.  They should have cuffed my rotors but didn't.  Instead they just slapped some new \""lifetime\"" pads on there and called it good.  Now, one year, later they want to charge me another $100 in labor to replace the \""lifetime\"" pads that have gone bad .\n\nThey try to say they are under new management to get your business, but they are not.  Same old scam."
0,"Can I rate it this zero stars instead of one? Worst food, worst portions, worst service, weak drinks. Pathetic."
0,"Per Yelp, 1 star = \""Eek! Me thinks not\""...that's pretty much how I feel about this place.  \n\nA few months ago, my fiance (then boyfriend) and I began our quest for a diamond engagement ring.  I was lucky enough to be in on the hunt with my fiance and I had clear parameters in regards to the cut, clarity, color, and the carat weight of the stone I wanted.  I was even luckier to have a flexible budget to work with...so my #1 priority was to find EXACTLY what I wanted at the best deal possible.  \n\nI walked into the store one Saturday afternoon by myself and was greeted by a saleswoman.  She was nice enough, chatted me up, found out what I was interested in and pretty much promised me the world.  She brought out a few stones that day...none of which I liked.  All of the stones she had were either HIGH COLOR GRADE and LOW CLARITY or vice versa, or they were just too small.  In any case, I spent a few hours there and was shown nothing I was interested in.  We did spend an hour looking at Hearts of Fire diamonds...but really those are all low in color grade and weren't even in the ballpark of what I wanted.  I wanted only D or E.\n\nAnyways, so when she was done with showing me what she had, she promised me that she would look throught their inventory and \""get what I wanted\"".  I was called back to the store on Tuesday.  I left work a few minutes early and had my fiance meet me at the store.  Again...the stones were missing the mark.  Either it wasn't the clarity  I CLEARLY stated I wanted, or the color was BELOW what I wanted..etc, etc...So again, we left.  \n\nI came back 2 weeks later after a few email exchanges and waiting for the saleswoman to get over a mild cold.  She told me she had a few stones coming \""from corporate\"" (wherever that is) and she was sure I'd love them.  So a few days later, I went back.  The stone was AGL certified...which clearly breaks my #1 criteria.  I wanted a GIA certified stone.  So...again...nothing.  It was pathetic.  I left.\n\nI called her the next day and asked her \""can you get me what I want?!  a GIA CERTIFIED 2 carat, D-E color, VVS1 and higher, princess or round stone?\""  After a few torturous silences and prying, she finally admitted that MJ Christensen had no such stone in their inventory.  However, they could order one and fly it in for me to look at.  (Now, if you're familiar with Jewelers, there is an ongoing \""exchange\"" of stones.  Authorized diamond dealers can take posession of a stone to show a customer at little to no cost...it is a customary practice.)  So, I said, \""Great!  Let me know when it's at the store so I can come see it.\""  \n\nThen she dropped the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life....she said, \""oh, we charge you $150 deposit to have a stone brought in.  It's a new policy, because we've been burned so many times.  If you decide to buy from us, the $150 is applied to your purcase.\""  I just about flipped my lid.  You're gonna charge me $150 to see a $25,000.00-35,000.00 stone that I might or might not like?  That policy is the most absurd thing I've ever heard.  A real diamond dealer (which MJ \""claims\"" to be) would NEVER charge such an insulting fee.  But what they really are is something a hair above your typical mall jewelry store.  Yes, their store is pretty.  Yes, they have been around for a long time (and closed a location last year).  But so has Kay Jewelers.  It's not exactly the place you go to if you're looking to spend some serious cash on a diamond.  AND TO SPRING THIS ON SOMEONE 1 MONTH INTO LOOKING FOR A DIAMOND WITH YOU.  IT'S JUST POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, REALLY.\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn't about the $150.  It was about the principle.  I kindly said thanks but no thanks and hung up the phone.  I've never looked back.... :)\n\nA month later, we found the most PERFECT stone RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET at Jack Weinsteins TOWER OF JEWELS.  Though the inside of the store might not be as \""pretty\"" as MJ Christensen, they know their stuff.  They were able to get us EXACTLY what I asked for in a matter of days.  Not only that, they gave my fiance a fair and honest price.  They made me a custom setting and I\""m very happy.  \n\nAlso, the prices at Tower of Jewels is SO much better.  It's hard to explain pricing of a diamond because there are so many factors.  But let's talk about settings.  Just to show the price difference, wegot my setting custom made at Tower of Jewels, with 1 carat of pave stones in 18k white gold for $1,100 (this was done in early March 2011).  MJ quoted my coworker $1,500 to do a 14k custom setting with NO STONES (last week).  Are you joking?!   Can you say R-I-P O-F-F?!  Ugh.\n\nIn closing, my fiance and I are truly happy with our decision.   I'm so happy I remained patient and focused on what I wanted...even though MJ Christensen essentially wasted over 1 month of my time...trust me, I will never go back to this place...eeeevvvveeeerrrr...unless something in there REALLY change"
2,"Even though Chin's was relatively inexpensive and decent, I wouldn't go there for good Chinese food. It was the 'noodles and company' of Chinese, very Americanized. It is a good place for college kids, like myself, to go and eat, hang out, but definitely not the best i've ever had."
3,"Out of many pho options along Spring Mountain Road, this is a good one, particularly because it's open later than most (until 3am) and offers a few Vietnamese beer options (Saigon red - yes!) Very large bowls of hot pho with lots of meat. The meat isn't the best quality - a bit stringy in some places, grisly or fatty in others, but there is plenty of it and enriches the flavor of the broth. You don't need the finest cut of meat for a good bowl of pho, and the broth is rich and the plates of vegetables and herbs that you add-in yourself are fresh and aromatic.\n\nThe traditional Hung bowl is a combo beef standard including tripe, liver, flank.\n\nPho ga is a great chicken-noodle, plenty of chicken. \n\nThe spring rolls are huge and fresh, though not the most flavorful. One order gets you four generous pieces.\n\nThe menu is expansive and includes not only several types of pho but also extensive non-pho options (rice and meat plates, curry, etc). These can be hit-or-miss, quite honestly - the meat tends to be overcooked or dry at times, but it's all fairly authentic to what one is offered in Vietnam itself. Simple, filling, delicious, and plenty of spices and rice to fill it out. (I like the menu here because it also includes an interesting article on the different food regions of Vietnam). \n\nAs for location, this is a spacious and clean area, brightened by fish tanks, plant age and various Southeast Asian gods and decor. Flatscreen TVs broadcast authentic Southeast Asian programming and music which is entertaining and experience-enhancing. It's definitely comfortable enough to spend a leisurely meal if you have the time. \n\nService can be rather slow. Again, it's a cultural thing.\n\nOverall, I enjoy getting an authentic, full cultural taste and experience with my international fair. Pho Hung does a pretty good job of it, and in that regard I have absolutely no complaints."
4,Great setup as a resort

Les deux autres ont quand m\u00eame une mention honorable, car elles \u00e9taient aussi bien bonnes.\n\nIl y a des saveurs originales telles que la zuppa inglesa (cr\u00e8me anglaise) et un beau choix de sorbets.  \n\nUne vraie g\u00e2terie d'\u00e9t\u00e9 en plein samedi soir!"
0,"This place is hardly a resort...it's barely a step up from a run down hostle! So why is the word \""resort\"" even in their name?!\nDon't be fooled by the nice pictures online because the remodeled rooms don't open until after oct 30th...false advertisement!\nOur room had no ventilation and there was something leaking cus our carpet had a growing wet spot. They permanently bolted the balcony doors because of the construction so there was no way to ventilate our room.\nThey did accommodate us with a room change, as they should have, which is why this hell hole even received 1 star from me.\nIf you want to stay here, wait until the remodel is over, but by then their prices will probably be just as expensive as any other strip hotel. \n+ cheap room in the middle of the strip and close to a lot of attractions."
0,"My used car was ready to take home 3 days later than Findlay North PROMISED it would be ready when we were in discussion. By the time it was delivered, I had left for a trip out of the country. Their lie was extremely unprofessional and caused much inconvenience to continuously have to call the dealership to hear that to they had lied to me and my car would not be ready before I left the country for my trip. The manager fed me a bunch of crap about the price that was different from what I had agreed to with the salesman. \n\nIn addition, there are multiple scratches on the hood of the car. Every other dealership that I have ever bought a used car from has had the decency to fix up scratches before giving it to the customer- further showing me why I should not do business with Findlay North.\n\nIt is completely unacceptable for a reputable dealership to lie to customers and offer such poor quality, which is probably why their customer parking lot was completely empty. I am a fan of Volkswagen cars, but I will be servicing my vehicle and purchasing future vehicles from any VW dealership OTHER than Findlay North. I will be letting my family and friends know about the service I received."

0,I deposited a check in bank of america atm before 8pm last night. The check was a little over $2200. It was written from a bank of america business account. They put a hold on the check for 1 week even though it was drawn on a bank of america account. They already debited the account it was written off of. They will not let my boss cancel the check yet they will not give me the money til the 4th. So why are they holding my money for 1 week. I put a check in last week and it cleared the next day. This makes no sense. I have started a srew bank of america facebook group that is growing by leaps and bounds. Take my advice & the hundreds of others in the group and dont use this bank. The worse part about it was the smug attitude of the manager. Join the fb group & let these bastards know that our business is a privledge and not a right!
2,"People are brutal reviewing this place! I stayed in the Monaco Tower for one night (cancelled flight due to Hurricane Irene and the Trop was booked solid!). The room had a small LCD or HD TV, can't remember what kind. Two Full Size Beds, desk, small windows, good individual air conditioner (not central) and a tall but useless dresser.\n\nThe good: \nStayed in the slightly larger and renovated room in the Monaco Tower.\nNo bed bugs!\nBeds were very comfortable but very hot, they couldn't keep my body heat down like the beds at the Tropicana.\nThey allowed me to check in at 2:45 pm and not 4 pm (the standard time)\nIt's one of the last old school casino's and I loved that (built in 1955).\nThe check in associate was SOOO nice and attentive, I forget the old man's name but he was awesome and so informative.\nThe hotel room did not smell at all, muy bueno.\nBathroom, all the basins/mirrors were clean\nThe check out associate give me the manager's direct extension in case I had any issues (I asked what to do if I didn't feel the room was up to par). I did have to use it and he picked up immediately.\n\nThe bad: \nCheck in time: 40 minutes.\nBathroom: the corner's on the floor were dusty and the floor looked like it needed a good wash. \nThe shower looked very old (and I was in a renovated room).\n$8 resort fee and I didn't use ANY amenities\n$10 internet fee per DEVICE not room - Spoke to the Manager, he said they are working on dropping the contract with LodgeNet to have their own internet which would be included in the resort fee.\nThe garage elevator was down right scary, I thought my life was in danger, it was dingy, dirty & rickety.\nThe Monaco Tower elevator was 10 times better, but still leaves a lot to be desired, it was dirty but would be really charming if clean.\nSUPER tiny refrigerator, still better than the Trop which had none.\nHilarious: \n--Saw the cleaning lady chillen in a room she was \""cleaning\"" for about an hour, hey, we all need a break every once in a while!\n--People watching here is priceless. A guy in front of me in check-in line was chugging down his 40, NO SHAME...my peoples, haha. I decided to join in on the fun and had a bud light lime while waiting! The crowd here is definitely full of character. \n--Saw someone checking in with their OWN microwave!\n\nI'm pretty upset I didn't have time to play at the BlackJack tables, I can't stand the $10+ minimum tables (it's even higher in Charles Town, WV and Atlantic City). If I recall correctly, they had $2 BJ tables and 3:2 odds (which are better supposedly).\n\nIf you're into BINGO, this is the place btw. Also the APA Nationals were being held here, pretty cool.\n\nIf I were to need a hotel room for a couple nights, I would def consider this place again!"
1,"I go here because it is close to my house, but it is usually a disappointing experience. First, the pricing practices by Kroger (and most other large grocery chains) are misleading at best. Surreptitiously down-sizing quantities, e.g. coffee, without lowering the price is one practice. The other is calling it a sale when they mark up an item then promote it as \""buy one, get one free\"". Most consumers know it is bull@$#t, but their marketing geniuses really think they are pulling one off. This week Fry's advertised pork ribs, \""buy one get two free\"". But their price for these ribs is $7.99/lb!! Gristly old pork ribs that normally sell for $1.99 - $2.99 per pound marked up to the price of a quality sirloin steak. I know the definition of a lie is pretty vague in business, but this type of pricing practice is about as close as it gets. They pretty much all do it so we have little choice in taking our business elsewhere, though this time I went to Sprouts and bought them for the honest price of $2.99 a pound. \nThe second issue is service. In business you can always have one employee that is having a bad day or is just bad at customer relations, but most of their checkout employees here seem unhappy. Don't know why, but maybe their personnel policies have the same effect on employee morale as their pricing policies have on consumers."
4,"Easy and cheap: the perfect combination! Well, for a grocery store anyway.\n\nThe fruit here always seems to be on sale and is much cheaper than most places. I have a slightly unhealthy addiction to cantaloupe and Fresh & Easy makes it, well, easy to fuel that habit by having the lowest prices on cantaloupe around. And they're always fresh! I love stores that are true to their names!\n\nThere's always a fully stocked clearance section at this location, full of food that has just barely hit the \""sell by\"" date on the packaging. I've found fruit, hummus, bagels, etc in there for really cheap. I don't eat meat, but I've seen a ton of different types in there, along with different types of sushi.\n\nThe Fresh & Easy brand vanilla almond milk is SO GOOD. \""How good is it?!\""...Well, it's so good my son asks for it by the name \""candy milk.\"" I've had a few other brands and this is by far the tastiest.\n\nThe employees are very helpful and friendly. The check outs are self-serve so if you're anti-social and just wanna buy some ramen noodles and frozen meals without the judging eyes of an elderly cashier, this is the perfect place for you.\n\nThey also send out mailers every week with coupons. I've seen some for $3 off of $30, $5 off of $25, and even $10 off of $50 which makes eating healthier a whole lot easier when you don't have to scrounge for copious amounts of coupons and instead get to use a single one for the entire store."
1,"PHX:\n\nRight now, the Phoenix airport is more of a 2 star airport, but it is undergoing a lot of renovations so I applaud the effort.  Sky Harbor International has an incredibly long way to go before it can be considered in the same class as some of the nicer international airports, let alone inside the U.S.  The terminals feel drab and dingy.  The old Southwestern-patterned carpets don't help, though there are eye-pleasing murals decorating the walls of some concourses.  Relatively low ceilings and limited window views of the outside coupled with dense passenger traffic can make some sections of this airport feel downright claustrophobic.\n\nSeriously though, entering this airport feels like taking a step back in time.  Remember the retro Taco Time theme of brown and burnt orange?  That's what Sky Harbor feels like.  Speaking of food, the restaurant selection here is abysmal.  Fortunately, the aforementioned renovations include the addition of several new eateries including local concepts.  There's currently a lot of on-going construction.\n\nAt least the future is bright for Phoenicians.\n\nFree Wi-Fi."
0,"Its official, Biancos has \""jumped the shark\"".  We used to eat at his place when he was in a strip mall on Camelback and watched his business \""grow\"" to what it is now.   I jokingly say \""grow\"" because he probably has less tables now than he did before.  The only difference is that he didnt have a wine bar to send his customers to wait for 2 hours.\n\nIf you've been to Biancos then you already know the game but for those who dont, here goes:\n\n1. You won't get in unless you stand outside for about 90 minutes before they open.  (Please)\n\n2. If you get there when they open, you'll be waiting for 2 hours. (Please)\n\n3. To make your 2 hour wait better he has a wine bar, which miraculously accommodates all the people he cant seat, where you will probably spend over $100 in booze as you wait.  Sort of like the beverage equivalent of the slot machines in the Vegas airport.\n\n4. When you jump through all those hurdles, you'll get some awesome food.  You'll also notice that he only has a few tables which is why the wait is so long.  I can appreciate the fact that he wants to maintin the quality of his food, resulting in limited production but is it \""all that\""?  For outside visitors with time on their hands it's probably worth it to go once and check the box.  For locals like me, go somewhere else.  For smart locals, start another, larger pizza place across the street;"
3,"A girlfriend and I were looking for somewhere not clubby, and not playing booming mashed up Top 40. We were looking for a dive bar with cheap drinks, with locals as opposed to tourists...a place to just sit and talk.\n\nTa-Da! This place is just across from Bally's. It's central to all of the activities on the strip, but about 1/8th of the price. For a Kettle/soda and a rum and Coke - $6 - total! The jukebox has a great selection...I played a few Black Keys songs, and one guy came up to me to ask who it was so he could play it later at home. This man's life has permanently changed for the better. And so has mine, now that I have a go to spot in Vegas that serves $3 cocktails!\n\n(Not that I'm in Vegas all that much, but still)"
4,"This is where I go to get my tea. I don't care if I have to drive out of my way, I'm not going to settle for less. They have the best selection of loose leaf tea. The staff is friendly and helpful and have great tea recommendations. Thanks to Fleur de Teas, I am branching out into iced teas. Never before have I tasted an ice tea blend that was worth drinking. \nFleur de Teas, I love you."
2,"Tasty breakfast, but place looked a little dirty. Not sure if it was because it was busy or thats just the away it is. Yes food was good. Waitress was very nice. Just need to clean the place a bit."
2,"I thought I'd go to LensCrafters because I wanted quality when it came to my glasses. But I wasn't very happy. The eye doctor they had wasn't covered by my insurance and even with my insurance and opting to keep my frames, it was much more costly than I thought it would be. I've been back twice trying to get my glasses fixed because one lens keeps popping out. I've finally given up. I'll just wait until it's time for new glasses and go somewhere else."
2,"I do like Treacle, and I was pretty excited when it opened up last year. Although I didn't mind the bar that existed in its place previously, I was definitely keen for some new faces on the East End scene, plus an excuse to get away from George Street for a while. \n\nTreacle gets good marks for being on Broughton Street, which in itself makes it cool, and it's packed with people most days, so the bar has a really good buzz about it. Free Wifi always bumps up my approval levels too. The fish cakes here are always a winner, and there are loads of cocktails on the menu, so you definitely won't be disappointed on that front. I also quite like the cool, random, cartoon-ish design on the wall on the restaurant side of the bar, and there's some good looking decor going on with the sofas, sheepskin and stone wall combo. I think it might just be personal bar taste, but more often than not, I prefer bars that you can lounge about in a bit more. If Treacle was slightly bigger, than I'm sure this would be possible, but I do feel a bit cramped in sometimes. Then again, it would be worse if the bar was always empty, then there would be too much space. They could maybe do with turning the lights down a bit too towards the evening, but that might also be the dark, seedy part of my personality talking. Overall, a nicely polished bar in a good location."
3,"Is it wrong to review a church? Maybe. o well.\nI'm getting maried here next year because I wanted my out of townies to see why i love phoenix. ( or at least what there is to love) I like and appreciate most churches in downtown environments and this place takes the cake. It reminds me of a lot of churches back east, plus its the only basilica in the state. just don't ask me what that means. the building is beautiful, most everyone is nice. And there's less homeless folks milling about than at the older churches back east. Or maybe its just the homeless people here are more well behaved because we have nice churches and good weather?\nwho knows. \nThe only downside to this place is that some parishoners have WAY too many non- well behaved small children with them, who tend to flounce around on the floor and shout. Not cool."
0,"Well, I can see why they did not actually put Mongolian BBQ on the sign but like a few other reviews have put, they do say stir fry.... To say I am some sort of Mongolian BBQ snob is in no way true but I will say, living in Northern California you definitely get spoiled having some great Mongolian BBQ spots to go check out. Now please remember, when I say Mongolian BBQ place I am talking about bowls the size of buckets and that you fill with the thinly sliced meat and then have your boxing buddy beat the hell out of the meat so you can fit all the veggies and then create the mount Shasta of noodles on top and then flood the bowl with great sauces. That is what got our mouths watering when we say the sign for this place as well as the guy walking to his car in the parking lot talking about how amazing it was. \n\nPerfect, we found a Mongolian place that the customers outside think is amazing.... Let me start by saying I would love to find out how often that guy eats spaghettio's for dinner because this place was the farthest thing from amazing. We were seated and given a menu, looking over it and seeing that one bowl is something like $10 plus $3 for all you can eat that should have been the red flag but then when the waitress brought our our pet food dishes I really should have known. We were handed 3 bowls if that is what you call them with some piece of paper that you have to pull some cirque stuff to hang onto. Let me explain these bowls, One is for your meat which is quite small and then the largest is for your veggies, now don't let the word largest fool you because it is far from that and they also give you this cup for sauce, it looks like the cups you get at chili's when you ask for a side of ranch. Really?? That just wont cut it for us saucy types. \n\nOh but Ray, the meat selection is the redemption.. Ha, sorry Mr. Genghis, the last time I check Peperoni and sausage sure as hell don't belong in Mongolian BBQ let alone a stir fry. Are you sure this isn't a pizza joint in disguise. I walked up to the meat and the chicken was floating in its own......well I'm not quite sure what that is that it is floating in but I know that it cant be good. I was so utterly disgusted by the choice we had just made to eat here but decided to give it a chance and move on down the line. Once you finish walking down the line you tell the guy at the grill what kind of noodles you want including spaghetti noodle... What the hell?!?! \n\nSo, by this time you have picked your ridiculous meat and your terrible veggies and filled your shot glass with sauce and handed it over to Brad the Mongolian Chef and you are counting on him to make it all better and well this is where the trip to Mongolia crash and burns literally, Burns. He dumps the bowls of goods on the burner and left it sitting there while they rang some crazy gong and damn near lit the place on fire. I guess it entertained the kids but while they are being entertained my food was charring.  I would much rather watch that guy skip around the grill turning my food while yelling ye-haw. That would definitely entertain me more since my food would be cooked correctly. Now for the biggest trick they attempt to pull, they have these bowls that are shaped like a piece of modern art that look gigantic but that is the one side the other sits about as high as the side of an inflatable raft in the ocean, if you are not sure what that is like just try it and you will see. \n\nIf you haven't figured out buy now, this is not a place that I would recommend and the fact that my wife and I both had terrible stomach pains that night after eating here guarantees we will never set foot back in this place and will definitely make sure our friends don't make the same mistake we did by thinking this was a Mongolian BBQ"
1,"We are sitting here right now and we were denied the access to the \""nice\"" area because my finance and best couple friend because he was wearing shorts. Mind you, expensive dressy shorts. When we booked our reservation nothing was said about this. We asked is there was anything they could do for us, they said they could book is another reservation at another restaurant. We then asked if we could be moved from the very back to the window, where we could see the show. That's when they offered to, again, make another reservation somewhere else. So be warned: they have a dress code that they won't tell you about."
4,"Hidden on the strip, this restaurant is an absolute delight."
3,"Went to Castles N' Coasters(only to play games in the arcade) and I had fun while I was there.  Air conditioning was cranking, place was clean and smelled pleasant, and game play was priced fairly.\n\n  I'll be back to experience the rest of Castles N' Coasters and hopefully will add a fifth star to my review."
4,"We lived in Augsburg for 2+ years (near Munich) and got to the 'real' Hofbrauhaus more than a few times. The Vegas version is near perfect in every way. Food, atmosphere, service, entertainment - GREAT!"
2,"The best part about coming to Duckworth's is the beer. With that being said, the best days to come and enjoy a beer are Tues & Thurs when most of the 50 or so beers they have on draft are $3.00. Those are the best nights to come and experiment with new beers and try something different. The food is a little bit above average bar food, nothing special going on here. The service isn't bad either. Be warned, if you come on $3 beer night it might be tough to find a table."
2,Decent fast food Chinese food. It's close to the house for those I don't want to cook kind of nights. I will go back since the food is always good at this location.
0,"They get 1 star for friendly. The place had 1 person working and she wore 1 glove to do a micro- dermabraision on me. She didn't even wash her hands between clients. She didnt even make sure my face was clear of anything. She just began the treatment. I honestly think she is just the damn secretary. She took a part that was dirty and put it inside of alcohol in a jar to clean it (between clients). I feel it needed more sanitizing attention. After she scraped my face up she sent me home. I was like hey can i get some sunscreen? My skin went through a rough time after this i broke out severely from the bacteria.  Such a disappointing experience especially since i got this through a Groupon. They gave me the run around for months before i could even get in. I have two more visits available and i will never go back, nor would i send anyone i know there. If you care about your skin as much as i do then go elsewhere. The office looks clean. **** Poor hygiene, friendly woman though."
1,"Having heard only good things, I had pretty high expectations for Monty's but I felt let down by the service and really let down by the food. The meals ordered, chicken in a pie and salmon cakes were both luke-warm and tasted like they had lived under a warming lamp for quite some time. This place it not worth the reputation."
0,"Had Chicken Fingers with Fries. I felt like I was eating grease on grease on grease. I should've went to Raising Canes, end of story."
0,"I was looking for a 5 Star Hotel in Las Vegas and decided to book a \""secret\"" 5 star hotel on Expedia and I got the Trump Hotel.  I would never consider a hotel in Las Vegas a 5 star hotel if it does not have a casino. It was very obviously a condominium building turned into a hotel. I was disappointed. I am warning all of you out there."
4,"Went for dinner last night with my husband. Very good, very impressed. Fast service, spring rolls were vegan - very fresh and beautiful presentation, excellent sauces. Both of us had the tofu vermicelli - so delicious and again, beautiful presentation. We left with a boba tea for both of use- yummy! We will go back again as soon as!"
4,awesome bday present from brett and amber... the show is absolutely amazing... i had chills most of the show!!! cant wait to see it again
1,"The staff was snobby. It was difficult to locate a menu. They acted like I was inconveniencing them by ordering there. There are no outlets, so not good for studying. They brought me a sandwich, even though I ordered a pizza. Then they brought my pizza, which was mediocre."
4,"Always my favorite place to go to breakfast on Sunday, there is always a line but the wait is usually short. Can't beat the home style cooking and fast friendly service. Biscuits and gravy just Like my mom made em."
2,"Snooze I want to like you more. More for your interesting breakfast combinations...funky vibe and breakfast cocktails. If you don't want to wait for an exorbitantly long time on the weekend. Then don't come here.\n\nWhy it is a long wait. The food is good, there Are not enough breakfast places in the valley that serve quality fair. sure. Honestly this is a management/staff problem: 1. Bussing tables is an issue that takes too long for the volume of people. 2. Empty tables.... There needs to be a system of who does and does not want to sit outside. I am seeing about 20 parties outside and 4 empty outside tables. You can't tell me that no one chose outside. We did. Still waiting. This is going to drive business down.\nSo management of Snooze take note we will not come back until you figure this out."
4,"I've been eating here for over a year and finally had to give it a \""yelp\"".  The food is delicious, the place is friendly and inviting, great staff including owners that actually work there, super clean and gives you the choice of being healthy or splurging.\n\nThey have a semi open kitchen, which I like and I don't think there is even a microwave on the premises.lol\n\nI've been in Vegas 8 years and breakfast is my favorite meal so believe me when I say that they have the BEST breakfast in town!  Their banana pancakes are to DIE for and their Corned Beef Hash with basted eggs would make my Nana cry with happiness.  They also serve that unsweetened passion fruit Shangra La Iced Tea that's hard to find.  Their lunches are great too and everyone I've ever taken there has been a convert.\n\nDon't be scared off it there's a line.  They are always quick to get people seated.  And now that the weather's nice you can eat outside.  I've also seen people with their pets outside which is hella cool too.\n\nThey are independently owned so patronize the entrepreneur not the corporate \""man'!"
1,Why is your gas at the pump still $3.30 when everyone else around 3.18
0,"I never give 1 star before. But this time... We wait here for over 30 minutes to get our hot pot. When we finally got it so disappointing. The hot pot is really really has no flavor, it tastes like nothing even we order a spicy flavor! So does the BBQ. \n\nAnd it wait so long! We just decided move to another restaurant."
2,"We tried Howie's once...we had it delivered when the in-laws were in town.  Everyone thought it was pretty good.  If you're looking for delicious gourmet pizza, this isn't it.  However, if you have a group, want some decent pizza, and don't want to spend a lot of money, I'd recommend giving it a try."
4,Great place for breakfast. I'm a big fan of the enchilada omelette.
1,"Great sales/finance staff! Smooth, easy car buying process. Horrible service department! Communication along with their customer service is terrible. Will not buy from again because of service department."
0,"I read another review that summed it up by saying \""This place is a dive.\"" It is old and tired. The \""bigger bed\"" that I was offered upon check-in turned out to be a queen, not a king. It is a motel, you drive to your room, which isn't a bad thing since you may be able to keep an eye on your car. I was amazed in the morning when the wheels were still on mine. The furniture is old and worn out as is the carpet. \n\nI spent about 6 hours in this place and was happy to get out. It isn't that they don't care, it seems they do, but it is like putting lipstick on a pig. If you are used to Motel 6, by all means stay at this \""Resort\"" and enjoy, otherwise pony up another 10 bucks and stay somewhere decent."
4,"My husband and I decided to check out Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille for our anniversary this past Friday night.  The food was truly excellent.\nThe lobster bisque was robust and flavorful, featuring two very large pieces of lobster claw meat, as well as plenty of other small bits of lobster.  My husband had yellowfin sashimi.  It was hands down the best thing we ate on Friday evening.  Sliced paper thin, nearly melt in your mouth, the presentation with fruits and veggies, it was just fantastic.\nMy husband had an upgraded Alaskan white salmon for his entree.  He could not stop raving about it.  It was light and flakey, very flavorful and grilled perfectly.  My entree was grilled sea scallops and shrimp."
1,"I went  here late morning when the restaurant was practically empty in a group of 6. They took our orders and 4 dishes came out a short time later. When we asked when the other 2 dishes (mine included) were going to come out, they looked at us for a second and then said \""oh, it'll be just a minute.\"" Clearly they had completely forgotten about them and had to rush back and make them. However, even with a very simple dish of Pho, it took some time for it to actually come out. \n\nDefinitely not impressed."
4,Very friendly staff and my dog looked so cute when they finished! Great prices too. Highly recommend!
0,"Yeah this is not great.\nFurniture from several decades in here.\nWeird plasticky rubbery woodish-looking floors.\nScratchy fur blankets at ends of beds have seen some action.\nWalls marred and filthy, furniture and cabinetry dinged and scratched. \nNo coffee maker. Really?? A room at a Motel 6 has one. And they wouldn't hand one over. Said my room wasn't equipped for it?\nWhere is the shampoo?\nThe wifi totally crawls...\nWhere's the fridge I requested (medical) that all of a sudden they're charging me for? I've never been charged for a fridge, or a coffee maker.\nOh I am not the first to use this roll of toilet paper... \nSome buttons on the phone don't work.\nNeither does the vending machine.\nEach person I talk to to try to address something sends me to someone else, and some of the folks are rude.\nI travel a *lot*. At least once monthly. I have stayed in so many hotels, and this one jst really blows, and not in a silly/sleazy/charming way, either (like Excalibur). Am only staying here b/c the meeting I'm attending booked into this place and it will be the *last time* for sure."
3,"Hubby and I really enjoyed the crepe we each had. I had the Rebel and he the Bananas Foster.  No too heavy, perfect ending to a nice late-August evening.  Now we have to try out the other flavors."
0,"So much for one of the best Reptile and fish stores in the Valley. As of 12/5/11 Pets Inc will be closing it's doors and (possibly) relocating shortly. For the next week, everything in the store is 50% off. The employee I talked to said they would probably be open until Dec. 10th and nobody knew for sure whether they would be closing for good or moving. I certainly hope they will just be moving as nobody else has the wide variety of species that Pets Inc does."
2,"We came here for lunch buffet and dinner.  Lunch buffet was a bargain but didn't have too much variety.  The curry chicken was tasty.  Dinner was a bit of a letdown considering how high our expectations were.  The common thread to the dishes we had was that they were super thai spicy even though we asked for medium.  When we were in thailand, some food was spicy but theirs was certainly way more.  Water and rice couldn't help.  I wonder if that's their trick.  To get your taste buds so numb that you can't taste anything.  Overall, it was good but not as good as Sripraphai in NYC.  Sripraphai may have less heat but is full on flavor."
3,"This is a great place, in a fun, funky neighborhood. The decor was more sophisticated/upscale but the prices weren't. I thought the food was great, and they stuck to their spiciness scale religiously. A 5 on a scale of 10 was perfect for me. I had the classic Pad Thai and Spring rolls. They were very yummy! The service was also good - polite and attentive. I would recommend it to anyone."
0,Food it's either salty or plain not flavor  the place is great the drinks awesome but the food it's iced cold .. not joke I don't see difrent from Roberts tacos lol
0,"First and foremost I have hesitated going into this place due to the over priced food on the menu and the stand offish attitudes from the staff. \n\nAfter finally giving them a try I was greated with their not so customer friendly service. Two girls who looked like I was bothering them. \n\nAfter finally getting my order in, it took them what seemed like 20 min to make an extra small overpriced burrito.\n\nWhen I ate this thing I almost vomited. It seriously made me nautious. I will not be going back to this establishment. Do not believe the hype people. The price you pay for the garbage they serve is outrageous. \n\nNo thank you."
3,"I came here for a celebratory lunch with a coworker.  We wanted yummy Japanese food and were NOT disappointed.  I had the Chicken Udon, it was a very nice serving, chicken was tender, and the noodles were quite good.  My colleague had the sushi lunch platter and was very happy with it - and she is a well versed sushi enthusiast.  The green tea icecream also received excellent reviews.  The decor is quite nice, there were a number of people there but, we didn't have to wait for a table.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Am definitely going back.  If they keep it up, they'll get five stars :)"
4,"After going to another Thai Restaurant and paying $12 for Pineapple Fried Rice, I was shocked with how cheap the prices were here. Around $7 for a big box of my favorite fried rice, and it tastes amazing? What more could you possibly ask for?\n\nWhile I'm still a little weary to try other menu items, I did order the Mango Sticky Rice after reading a few good things about it here on yelp -- and it's actually really, really good. I was a little afraid how rice and fruit would mesh together, but it's tasty without being too sweet.\n\nClean looking restaurant, great tasting food, and I love how inexpensive it is."
0,This place looks good on the reviews but my experience proved otherwise. I ordered 2 scrambled eggs and a pancake. The Eggs were overlooked and pancake was burnt! \n\nWe also ordered coffee but that was less than mediocre. I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars.
1,"I hesitate to give 1 star but I would really love to. I'm giving 2 stars because the girl who actually checked me out was nice and the Vet tech was nice and handled my cat with care. I'm going to be honest this visit started out on a sour note. My cat had been acting weird and her fur had gotten gross/matted etc. Obviously something was wrong with her and I didn't have a current Vet so I called the closest one to me. They got me in that afternoon which was awesome (another reason for an extra star), however nothing really good came after that. I left work early and went to wrangle my cat into her carrier, ended up at the office early. So I sat to wait. Two of the women who sit at the front desk were disgusting people. Seriously the older women sat up there and talked crap about every single person who called or walked in. I mean hateful vile crap... I was horrified that an establishment would allow such behavior. They are nice as can be to people's face (sort of) but the minute they walk out or hang up it's just cattiness at it's worst. I absolutely almost walked out right then. My appt. was at 4 and they called me back about 415-420 at that point I'd been there for 45 minutes or so listening and watching them be catty. The vet tech comes in and I warn her that my cat doesn't like to be held etc. so she suggests they wait for the Dr. So the Dr comes in and honestly I felt like she didn't know much about cats. She kept looking at me like I was crazy when explaining what was going on with my cat. Basically treated me like I was wasting her time and all she kept saying was wow I wouldn't expect her to be so strong and fast at her age. In process of getting my cat to the vet her tooth came out this obviously, must have been what was wrong with her as she's better now (you'd think the Dr would have mentioned that as a possible source of issue). The Dr. said do we have your permission to do blood work, urine sample etc. I agreed to it as I truly wanted to know what was wrong with her. They said they'd call me back the next day with the results... so I got a call from a different Doctor who said well she has some elevations here and there but nothing definitive and well we can't really tell anything. If you want to bring her back you can but not much we can do or tell. Basically they knew NOTHING, not even a small indication of what could be wrong. Honestly I felt like they wasted my time and my money to tell me absolutely nothing, and to do absolutely nothing. Well I guess the only good thing from this office visit was that my cat lost her tooth and appears to be feeling soo much better, her fur is already starting to brighten up etc. \n\nSorry sooo long but my suggestion to anyone looking for a Vet's office is to avoid this one. I got no sense of security in them caring for my pets, I didn't feel they were knowledgeable and any office or Doctors who would let those two women be the face of their customer service and support obviously have issues. Those women were the most awful people I have met in a long time!!"
0,"I am so embarrassed...I am a member of yelp and I didnt even bother to use yelp for reviews in circus circus before I booked a room. But I will sure use yelp to write a review on circus circus.\n\nGHETTO!!!!! Its the same as it was when they built it. Just really sketchy. I felt very uncomfortable and didnt want tostay there. Room was yucky, bathtub didnt drain, toilet leaked, very outdated and an old box of baking soda outside the window.....hmm...and wierd carvings inside the desk drawer. They also had to use a sharpie pen to write the numbers on the elevators.\n\nOi....We left a day early and I will never stay there again."
3,"Had a craving for Korean BBQ and wanted it to be near the strip 'cuz I was picking up a friend.  DJK is a couple miles away from the Palazzo-Wynn area and it got good reviews so it sounded good to me.  Get there a little after 7pm on Monday and it's not crowded.  That's good 'cuz I don't like crowded places.  We order \""Love\"" for $45.  That's a tad bit expensive for Korean BBQ (my fav. all you can eat KBBQ spot in LA costs roughly the same) but love is priceless (and this is Vegas, a cheap quality mean is tough to come by) so it's all good.  It also came with all the complimentary sides so common in Korean restaurants and drinks for two; be it soju, beer, soda, or iced tea.  The service was great.  Very friendly.  The meat was tasty and the whole meal was filling.  I could have and probably would have eaten more if there was more to be eaten but I did leave very satisfied.  Though, it should also be noted that I eat slightly more than the average bear.  Overall a great experience and I will be returning again.  Just as soon as I can save up enough money to afford it."
2,"Clean room, basic, no frills, nice pool & spa, friendly staff, no extra incidental deposit, hard to get to the 1st time (enter from K-Mart parking lot). I'd stay here again."
3,"4.45 stars.\n\nI strolled into the Bradley Ogden lounge on a Monday evening, hungrily surveying the intimate space for quiet whispers and plush cushions to soothe my ringing ears and aching feet. Sliding into a chenille armchair the color of oatmeal, I felt my shoulders relinquish their vigilant posture, and sighed. \n\nPerusing the short, interesting menu, I opted for the famous Kobe and ribeye burger with frites and a peanut butter cup martini. The martini sidled up to my table a few moments later, flaunting a garnished rim of peanut butter and chocolate crumbs. This heady beauty swirled chocolate vodka, peanut rum, chocolate liqueur, cream, and simple syrup infused with peanut butter seductively in her glass, rendering a nicely layered drink with a rich, slightly earthy profile. She stayed with me through the meal, and promised to see me again. \n\nIn due course, a gleaming burger, a tall cone of frites, a simple, luscious green salad, and sides of Dijon mustard and housemade mayonnaise requested a spot at my table. Never one to miss a new experience, I welcomed their company, particularly as the burger was lightly scented with red wine butter and smoke. Moist, rich, and beautifully pink, the burger dazzled my palate, its light touch of blue cheese perfectly complementing the light seasonings, its soft egg brioche roll a subtle cushion absorbing its juices. The frites were nicely browned and earthy, while the fluffy salad greens were dressed with a miso vinaigrette whose silky finish prepared my palate for the richness to come. An excellent meal.\n\nThe service was relaxed, gorgeous, and engaging, the drinks were innovative, if occasionally touched with flakes of ice, and the lounge perfect for a quiet, casual dinner for couples or single travelers. Recommended."
1,"What a completely disappointing experience!!!  I had high expectations from a 5-star hotel, but my experience proved that wrong. \n\nBeing the newest and one of the nicest hotels on the strip, my friend decided he wanted to stay here to celebrate his dirty 30.  We decided to stay from Friday, October 14 to Sunday, October 16.\n\nRESERVATION:\nWe had a decent size group so I decided to call into reservations and see if we could get a group rate.  My information was passed on to the celebrations department and I worked with Angela Cooper to set things up.  She was able to set a website up for our group so Cosmo would know our group was together and place us in rooms near each other.  In addition, because a site was set up, we were guaranteed set rates up until a certain date.  What wasn't clearly told to me was that a \""block\"" of rooms would be reserved for me, but it doesn't mean rooms next to each other are reserved no matter how early you book, it means it's based on availability.\n\nCHECK-IN: What a horrible experience!!!\n*We checked in at the front desk at 1:20pm and were told that our room wasn't ready.  When I booked my room, it asked what time I would arrive.  I entered 1pm...why ask what time we'll check in when you're clearly not going to honor it?\n*The girl checking us in said she would check us in so when our room was ready, they would call us and give us our room number.  She also said she would notify housekeeping to get our room ready as soon as possible so it shouldn't be too long.\n*I mentioned to the girl checking us in that we had a block of rooms and wanted to make sure we were together.  She looks up a couple of names and said we're all on the same floor.  Turns out, we weren't (more on this later...)\n*We decided to walk around and get something to eat.  An hour later, we still didn't receive a call.  My friend calls and they said it would be another 10-15 minutes until our room was ready.\n*Being the tweeter that I am, I tweeted how annoyed I was.  Cosmopolitan tweeted me back mentioning that check-in technically wasn't until 3pm. Fine, I'll wait...\n*It's 3:15pm and I still haven't received a call that our room was ready.  My friend calls again where the operator had to contact the front desk.  They said our room was just about ready and we were able to go up.\n*We head up to our room.  WTF our keys aren't working.  My friend calls again where the operator says that's the correct room and they'll send security up with new keys for us.  \n*While my friend is on the phone with the operator, I'm on the concierge phone.  I'm told the bellboys could only bring keys to me if I'm in my room.  If I was in my room, why would I need keys?!  I said they could show them my ID to verify that it was me in the hallway.  I was then told only security could do that.  Fine, send me security!!  \""It'll be 30-45 minutes until security can come up there\"" I was told.  Ughh!  Back down to the check-in desk I went.  \n*One of the birthday boys calls me and let's me know he just checked in and is in his room.  He tells me what floor he's on...NOT THE FLOOR THE CHICK CHECKING ME IN TOLD ME THEY WERE ON.\n*I expressed to a manager, I believe his name may have been Terry, how upset I was.  Although nice, we were simply credited $50 for food and beverage.\n*I was still tweeting with Cosmopolitan who had asked for my last name to contact the front desk to try to help me out.  They then tweeted me back to enjoy my upgraded room.  Ummm...I didn't receive an upgraded room, this was the room I paid for. FAIL!!!\n*We get to our room, we don't even have hand or face towels. \n\nROOM:\nWe decided to book a terrace studio room which at the time of booking was $280/night +tax.  The room had two queen beds, large bathroom complete with both a shower and tub, a small living room area, and a kitchen area which consisted of a sink, microwave, and fridge.  However, don't think you could store things in the fridge, it's all minibar items!  The room has two tv's, however no tv in the bathroom.  The terrace room looked towards the MGM and Aria direction.  I think if you want a view of the Bellagio, I believe you have to pay the premium view price.  \n\nApparently I had a faulty room because it was EXTREMELY difficult for me to open the terrace door.  After going to one of our other friend's room, we also found out that we were missing the seat/ottoman combo on our terrace.  \n\nBecause of my experience combined with the amount we spent to stay at a \""5 star\"" hotel, I doubt I would ever stay at the Cosmopolitan again unless my trip was comped.  No doubt, Cosmopolitan will be receiving a complaint letter from me...an actual snail mail complaint letter!"
0,"Every time I go (not by choice) they workers are so unpleasant!!! The food isn't even good but their boba is decent. Very, very fusion like, nothing on the menu is authentic. I swear the name is what brings the people in because it sure is not the noodles!"
0,I have wanted to try this place.  We went at 11:00 on Mother's Day.  The place was at least 80% empty.... both inside and outside.  We went to the hostess stand.  The woman said there would be at least a 30 minute wait because they were waiting for the 11 and 11:15 reservations to arrive.  Really??   They didn't know how many seats those reservations would take?  We will never go back.
1,"Very disappointed.  I had high hopes for this place being more than a generic wanna-be authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'm sure this place is better than what I experienced but I probably won't give it a 2nd chance and here's why.\n\nOur waiter was so dull & clueless.  I seriously think he must be a relative they HAD to employ.  I know it's not a dream job but he really looked upset to be there.  Whenever I go to a new place I always ask what dish makes their restaurant worth coming back for... you know, what do people tend to favor.  He had no clue how to answer this.  I asked if they had any drink specials & he said no.  Turns out they had Sangria (which I usually like), but I didn't order it b/c I had already ordered a beer.  He was rushing us to order.  If I had more time we would have ordered an appetizer, but I guess he prefer we spend less.  I asked for green enchiladas, instead I got red.  He could only do one thing at a time.  When he brought our order, instead of clearing our table to make room for the plates, he just plopped down the meals on top of the dishes already there - making a lot of noise and making things flop all around.\n\nI saw dishes on other people's tables that looked better than ours, which only made me blame the waiter more for rushing us.\n\nWhile it may not be fair to judge this entire restaurant because of one waiter, the fact that they let this guy work in public makes me question anything this place does.\n\nBut what about the food?...  very mediocre.  My favorite part of the meal was the beans... pretty sad."
0,"Poor Service, long wait time, no internet, very limited seating. If you are not a local who knows the staff, I would not go to Cafe Cravings for coffee or breakfast. On my multiple trips for weekend breakfast (most recent being my last), my order was taken, and several people were served ahead of me. A wait time of 20 minutes for a bagel egg and cheese that bruggers manages to put together in less than 5 minutes is inexcusable and seems to be the status quo at this shop. The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is a decent attempt at hometown coffee shop, but if you are looking for good service, this is no place for an outsider."
4,"I came across this place when I first moved to Vegas when I lived at Jones and Charleston.  The place is clean and the people there are always cool and there is a great magazine collection.  Best barbers I've ever had!   Priscilla knows the exact cut I want, so I keep going back."
2,The yogurt here is pretty good depending on the flavor you choose. I just feel that it is really over priced for what you get.
3,So I've never seen a Cirque show so there's nothing really to compare to but the props in this show absolutely blew me away!\n\nI cannot begin to imagine how someone dreams this up or choreographs these shows and what rehearsal or practice is like but I know I wouldn't be able to do it.  These entertainers are simply amazing and talented. I can't wait to watch more!\n\nSure the storyline is difficult to grasp and follow but the performances are out of this world.
3,"I'm so thankful that I found out about Union Project. Bobby & I had a blast working with the clay and making our own ceramics. Everyone from the instructor to the others  enjoying open studio offered to help us and gave us great tips! It was such a relaxing, artistic experience. I'm looking forward to going back. \n\nOpen studio is Wednesday evenings & Saturday afternoons. It's $10/hr and clay, firing, & glazing are included. They also have ceramic classes and other things at Union Project (we witnessed zumba & yoga in two hours). If you're looking for something new to try, I would check into their website to see what's all offered. (especially now that summer is over! *sad face) \n\n(PS, a BIG thank you again to everyone who helped us!)"
1,"a few of the clubs back home pretty much s**tted on this place, which is pretty sad for a vegas club.\n\nwe got talked into going by a promoter.. it was not as good as he said it would be.\n\nmusic sucked.\n\ni'm 25, but the crowd was a very MUCH older crowd.\n\nto say the least, i won't be going back to blush again."
3,"Patties is in great location near the heart of everything in Old Town.  It's a Scottsdale version of a dive bar (Cen Pho peeps, this means it's \""classy\"" for us! haha).   I like the somewhat confusing layout of the bar with several rooms and bars, you can mix things up.  \n\nThere's always an interesting mix of people, especially depending on the time of day you are there.  It's an older crowd doing some day-drinking on the weekends, jamming to the band and the crowd gets progressively younger as the night wears on  (or maybe that's my imagination as the drinks add up??). \n\nI like bars that have activities to keep me entertained whilst drinking it up  -  Pattie's scores 5 stars in that category!   You can play shuffleboard, pool, ping pong, take out your aggression on the boxing game or just hang out and enjoy the people watching.   I like live music, so I dig it when the band is playing, but they also have great music playing when there isn't a band.  People love to dance here too.  \n\nGreat bar, great vibe, bring your dolla bills and add it to the wall and ceiling collection.  You'll have fun, I promise!"
4,"We absolutely loved the hotel! Having already stayed at other high end resorts for example the Aria, the Monte Carlo is an affordable, comfortable, luxurious and fun hotel! We loved everything about the hotel! Right down stairs is a Starbucks and mcdonalds, so everything was at close range! During the week it's more family oriented rather than weekends, but nothing too crazy! I really enjoyed my stay here! The pools are the best part! They have a river, wave pool, regular pool and a jacuzzi! There's many areas to layout, but I recommend to go early when the pool opens to save a spot!"
2,"Okay so i felt compelled to leave a review for this place, not for the twinkies, or the Oreos, but for the sweet deal on Liqour. So from the street you see the entry-way of this dive and you see two 6 foot tall swamp donkeys in what looks like some special bed sheet showgirl outfits, But just above the goddy head pieces these \""monsters\"" are wearing you see a glistening rectangle of lights telling you to come get a football of beer, or your favorite blended drink for $6.00. Now, those of you who have not seen these, \""Footballs\"", that is exactly what they are. 52oz of ice cold impairment. The first time you buy one it ends up costing you $12 for beer and $14 for blended drinks but when you go back for a refill the $6 deals begin. The 55 year old woman behind the counter greets you with the farah faucet look serving you up your drink while attempting to flirt a few more cents into the tip Jar. All i have to say is remember your football next time you come down to the experience other wise the trunk of your car begins to look like a young P.E. teachers ball bag. \n\nEverytime I have been in this place filling up my ball, I smell the grease ball snack bar in the corner, sorry to the oreo lovers but it smells like old oil and you walk out of there smelling like a teenager leaving the obyss of deep fryers after picking up the bi-weekly paycheck."
0,Walked in there last weekend to check it out- no one was at the front counter to seat us- waited 10min to be sat- place was'nt packed and walked out. \nMenu was very limited. \nMaybe they should call John Taffer to help them out.
4,"So we're on the Deuce rolling along the strip when we passed by Serendipity 3. My sister and I literally let out squeals of delight and started screaming \""we gotta come here for dessert!!!\"" yes, we did, in a bus full of strangers and we were possibly jumping up and down in the process. Did i mention, I'm 29 and my sister is 26.. and yes we still get excited for ice cream. \n\nWhat we didn't realize, was there was this Buddhist shrine that's been donated to Cesare's and was placed right in front of Serendipity (super random right?) It was incredibly gorgeous with sand pits for incense, and they even provided incense and matches for prayers! Being the Buddhist we are, my sister, mommy and i promptly lit up and did some prayers. Was funny because there were all these people passing by us and they started taking pictures of us during our prayer. YEA US! \n\n\nWhat I Thought: We got there around 9:30pm on a weds night and the wait was only 25 mins. We were seated indoors (thank god, even at night it was bloody hot) I've heard so much about Serendipity (blame food network) i was extremely excited we found time in our schedule to stop by. And yes, i realize the \""frozen hot chocolate\"" is really just glorified chocolate milk, but the point is.. I REALLY WANTED ONE!!! (damn you perky Rachel Ray for putting the thought in my head) \n\nWho I Dragged Along: Ros and our Mommy \n\nAtmosphere: Uber cute!, very sweet candy shop feel. \n\nPrice: For the 3 of us, the total was $50-something including tax and tip. \n\nWhat We Ate: We decided to share a meal since we knew we wanted to make room for dessert. \nSpinach/Artichoke dip - serious yum with huge pieces of shaved parm on top, my mom adored this \n3 cheese omelet with waffle fries - oomg FLUFFIEST OMELET EVER!!! It was seriously huge, I'm thinking..maybe 6 eggs went into it? It was soft, fluffy, filled with goooey cheese and was seriously.. perfect! \nVanilla/coffee hot fudge sundae - my sister's choice, it was good as far as sundae's go, but.. $14 for ice cream and chocolate sauce? ummm... \nFrozen hot chocolate - Ok.. so $11 for basically... chocolate milk blended with ice and a load of whipped cream on top, and don't get me wrong, it was rich, creamy and delish! I drank nearly the entire thing and it was great for a 1 time thing to do. But really.. i was.. i dunno, underwhelmed? \n\nParking: ride the deuce baby!! \n\nWould I Come Back: yes and i want the omelet when i do! seriously, yummiest omelet ever! \n\nDid i miss anything?: Did i mention the omelet? I gotta mention our waitress, she was awesome, attentive and took great care of us.\nMy mom is fantastic, but like a typical Asian Mom, she complains a bit... nothing was said about this place, so if it pleases Mom, it makes our night a Lil happier!"
2,"My title rep recommended Bund Shanghai for our lunch meeting. I felt confident trusting her judgement because she is Chinese and speaks fluent Mandarin...sort of like having a VIP connection when ordering :)\n\nMy first impression of BS was how nice and clean this establishment is...no funky odors or dirty smells from unsanitary conditions found in some Chinese restaurants. The decor was very nice and we sat at one of the cute booths. The place settings are very pristine and made me excited to enjoy a meal here.\nWe ordered some pan fried dumplings which S recommended, stir fried noodles and some har gow shrimp dumplings.\n\nI don't remember the name of the stir fried noodles we had and I don't see them on the online menu here, but they were very good. I posted a picture that looks exactly like it does on their current menu. The noodles had the right chew (like al dente spaghetti) with a very light brown sauce and what seemed like minced mushrooms, maybe a little pork mixed in with julienned cucumbers. It was light and delicious.\nThe har gow was ok...not much flavor but ok.\n\nThe deep fried dumplings had a unique texture combination of steamed doughy dumpling and lightly pan fried bottoms, accented with black sesame seeds and minced green onions on top. The filling wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, and even S agreed they weren't as good as usual...possibly attributed to the recent change in chefs. But they were fun to eat with a little chili sauce to enhance it.\n\nThe owners seems to know the regulars and S was treated well as one of them. We got to enjoy a special complimentary jelly-like dessert with pieces of squash that S called the \""inexpensive version of bird's nest soup\"", and the owner claimed to be \""good for our skin\"".\nMy rating should be more like 3.75 stars. Good food and a good value for this unassuming place on the Southwest corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain. The parking lot is scarce with additional parking in the back. It's a nice family owned restaurant with friendly service and good food. I'm looking forward to coming back with my family soon and enjoying the other menu items. Xie Xie!"
1,"Even half off the value was just terrible and I left hungry. I have been here several times with a friend who works for the parent corporation and gets 1/2 off our bill. \n\nWith the discount I felt I could try a bit more and started my meal with an appetizer. I had the Ahi Poke, similar to a caviche small cubes of ahi came in a martini glass seasoned with some soy and garnished with a wasabi mayo. It was good but quite small. \n\nFor my meal I selected the \""Roy's classic trio\"" consisting of Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi & Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. It came out with 3 small I mean small plates in a tasting style display. The Ahi was great, the spices went well with the cool raw interior. The Butter fish was nice too with a sweet miso glaze on a bed (or pillow in this case) of black rice. I thought the salmon was a bit over cooked. After I had finished the three 2oz tastings I was still hungry. \n\nI am probably not the only one with this opinion as on both weekday visits we were one of two tables.\n \nI think if they want to increase the plate count they should lower the prices and or up the portion size."
4,"Ridiculously tasty all the way around.. i feel for the bartenders because some of the signature cocktails look pretty painstaking, especially the mojitos, which they took the plunge and put on happy hour. Did the ginger one, epic, original flavor. \nI normally am not fond of eggplant, but the eggplant mozzarella melt is similar to a caprese on a crostini, hardly any of the funky eggplant taste. Artichoke crab dip is pretty much the same anywhere i go. But where they took home the gold for me was the cajun chicken sandwich w the side salad. Chicken was beyond tender, and incredibly juicy throughout.\nSignin up for this allegedly ridonkulous creamed corn next round.. so full."
3,"I remember Bahama Bucks from my old ASU days.  When one of the girls said let's go I was happy to!  I was glad to see one was down the street from where we were, so plus plus!  It is in the strip mall in a huge plaza.  It is by the Native New Yorker.  \n\nIt was pretty packed on a Saturday night, so we waited for about 10 mins in line before it was our turn to order.  Ordered and then waited another 10 mins before our order was completed.  I ordered the blue coconut with cream, YUM!  I only had a baby size, it was just right!!!"
2,lonnng wait!
4,"Last time I tried pilates was years ago and honestly I didn't get the whole buzz.  Reformed Pilates is completely different.  Their classes are a GREAT workout that are fun and fly by, plus the staff is incredibly kind and supportive.  Definitely check them out!"
0,"Local review...\n\nEmployees here get away with belittling patrons and running them out.  I sat down and within 5 minutes heard out dealer insult foreign people who couldn't count fast enough with comments like \""take off your shoes if you can't count and use your toes!\"".  When brought to the attention of the pit boss (Jackie vong) he apologized and said he would address the situation.  Shortly after sitting next to someone else who God forbid used the \""f\"" word in Vegas (not insulting anyone, just jokingly expressing his loss) we were all grouped and asked to leave.  I will NEVER return to this place.  I kept returning hoping the place would be better but I would much rather stick to the SUNCOAST next door where they know how to treat people and have a much better environment.  Save your money and spend it somewhere where you will be treated with dignity."
4,"This place has every nut , bolt and screw you will ever need! staff is helpful and attentive!!!"
3,"This place is awesome  It'd be even more awesome if you are here on a business account.  it is pricey, and the drinks seem to be thimble sized.  But the sushi!  The sushi is impeccably fresh.  The sensai roll (triple color, yellowtail, tuna and salmon) is literally one of the best rolls I've had.  The rice was well seasoned (could use a smidge more vinegar) but a great foil and not too much rice. \nEgg custard is not to be missed.  Served in a little ceramic cup with a lid, it stays piping hot.  Smooth, rich and filled with seafood, it is amazing.  Another don't miss is the claims. The clams are dotted with truffled butter and miso before a quick broil.\nSo overall, loved this place.  it's pricier than even Roka Akor.  (They have sushi boats that start at $250.00) But the fish is amazing, the service is kind an worth stopping in at least once.  Weirdly for a really nice restaurant, they give you paper napkins rather than cloth.  Minor quibble, but I still found it weird given the attention to detail every where else.  The bar and tables for instance are some of the prettiest and comfortable pieces of furniture around.  But no cloth napkins?"
2,"You can't beat the happy hour prices here ($3 beverages and food - and the portions are huge), but it wasn't out of this world for me. The decor was very old school 70's and it just felt like an outdated place. Our waitress was nice, but forgettable. I probably wouldn't come here again because there are so many other great happy hour places in Scottsdale."
2,"I used to love CBW but in the past several years, they have become more pricey and the food quality has gone downhill. Their pizza is delicious and the beer is ok but not great. Their salads are generally very good too. Everything else I would say is about average for Pittsburgh.  The service there also tends to be slow.  All in all the atmosphere is cool but the food and service could probably use a little improvement. I would say it's still worth going on occasion for a pint and a pizza."
1,"I've got mixed feelings on this place really.  Been there probably 4 or 5 times and only bought something twice.  I've noticed some repeat vendors and majority of stuff is kind of pricy and tames to the older folks.  One thing I do recall buying there was a turquoise ring (You know the \""Native American\"" jewelry sold by Caucasians haha).  I thought it looked cool and don't remember for sure how much it was ( I think $50ish, but all I know that it wasn't cheap. \n\nAnother thing I bought was a Navajo circle of life for around $55-$60 I got at another vendor operated by another white (still hanging in my room).  I have a thing for Native American arts and artifacts.\n\nThe place isn't too bad, a lot of parking and quite a few vendors, just nothing that really catches my eye."
3,"Just came back from Vegas. Stayed at Caesar's. Room was beautiful, Venus pool was OK. Went to drai's rooftop pool across the street at the Cromwell, got free admission, drinks were priceythough. \n\nAt caesars staff were very good and prices were reasonable. Went to the bacchanal buffet for dinner it's 50 ahead but sooo good and so many options. \n\nI would recommend Caesar's it's pretty cool and central. Just the no free wifi was a pain for me. So it's really a 3.5 star for me but still I would return."
1,"\""Morels\"" should change their name to \""Lessels.\""  If you like tiny servings of just average items, then this is up your alley\n\nThe only thing \""more\"" about the place are the huge paintings of people cuddling (which I, as a self proclaimed Art Guru will give the artist a B+) the outrageous wine by the glass $$ screw over tactic, and the snooty overall feel of the place. \n\nCan't you just feel that sometimes? Lord ya can sense it.  Why don't I trust myself knowing that I am going to get sticker ass shocked in the end.? $50.00, yes...FIFTY dollars a glass for a stingy-ass pour of GD Merlot.  Good grief!\n\nI liked the cheese thing, but honestly? I was expecting something for dinner that would make my senses perk.  The only thing that perked was my ass when I got the check.\n\nSorry chef what's your name but a course at the CIA just might be in order, and re-address the food portion.  Frankly, there are other choices in Vegas that are a far better deal for the wallet and the palette.."
0,Dirty place! They don't even wear gloves when making the food. Also one employee had a bad attitude when he forgot to toast my bread after asking me if I wanted it toasted. He was upset with me because he forgot which I didn't understand. When making the second sandwich he was throwing the food together resulting in a terrible sandwich. I will never go to this Subway again!
0,Long wait it took forever for them to come and take my order then it took forever for them to make the food they forgot the onions and no peppers this place isn't what it used to be :(
0,"What universe did I step into? This place was recommended as THE PLACE to go after the 3am last call. They don't serve alcohol here. Heed the warning signs. We should have ran for the hills when we saw the mostly male line. But my friend and I decided to chance it. Next warning: the $35 cover. Chance it? Okay! Oh, what now? Guys at the coat check are turning in the shirts off their backs... I've seen juicehead guidos do this at PachaNYC but was this a theme party? Sh*t, we lost $35.\n\nThis place is massive. It reminded me of the raves of the early 90's. I get it. Does the music have to be THAT loud? My ears were leaking blood. After walking around, we quickly realized what this place is all about. Want to get high anyone? I can bet you $35 that everyone was tripping. Maybe I should have put myself out of my misery and joined. Why did I turn away the nice guy at the adjacent urinal who offered me E? If you want to smoke a cigarette, be prepared to traverse a labyrinth. It's designed to give methheads a chance to flush the pills when the police show up.\n\nCircus made me want to run back to NYC."
2,Amazing food but terrible service! Came in for a birthday party and waiter got our orders super slow and couldn't seem to separate the check. Weren't apologetic at all or friendly during service. I suggest getting your meal from the bar when you come in.
2,Excellent breakfast selection and great dinner choices. I would recommend trying their crispy French toast for breakfast while sitting outdoors underneath the umbrellas with the Mummy Mountain scenic view! \nThey also have yummy fish tacos and a nice artichoke appetizer to compliment your meal at dinner.
1,"Ok....went here yesterday for a birthday celebration with party of eight. Asked for waters for all...two people were brought water. Finally, all of us received water, after asking once again.  I ordered Cab Sauvignon wine and was poured a white wine...which I refused. My husband ordered a second can of Hef beer (they only have four beers on tap - the rest is canned or bottled)...when he ordered a second, he showed the server his can and she SNARKELY said \""Sir, I KNOW what you ordered.\"" My husband and I exchanged glances. \n\nWhen the bill came, I grabbed the calculator on my phone....and figured out what my husband and I owed....then added up what everyone else put on the table so that we could leave our server a 20-25% tip. It added up. Then a SECOND person at our table added everything up...came out the same. When all was paid, the server was sent BACK to our table because her manager said we didn't leave enough money to cover the bill and leave a tip!  The manager then came over to speak with us.  HOW, when TWO separate people added everything up prior to giving our money to the server, we agreed  that there was enough to cover the bill AND leave a nice tip????  I have NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME.  We have two daughters in the food industry and KNOW the importance of leaving a generous tip.\n\nMy husband and I frequent the Fox Restaurants often as we support local. HOWEVER.... After this experience it is doubtful that we will eat at another Fox Restaurant for a long time.....there are other locally-owned places to spend our time and money....LGO and Chelsey's Kitchen, Upward Foundation's Postino, Federal Pizza, JoyHouse Taco, and Windsor, Oregano's, Bianco Pizza, Cibo, etc., where our money, and our friend's and coworker's money can be spent and we won't have this kind of treatment. \n\nSHAME ON THE HENRY STAFF.... This was not a good ending to an enjoyable night out with friends. I LOVED the decor and feel of this restaurant, however it was so loud that we had to shout across the table to talk.... the service was so-so.... the food was GREAT!"
1,"Creepy Manikin alert!\n\nUpon entering the store, you immediately think that some Twilight Zone episode has come to life as their creepy multi-cultural manikins greet you with vacant stares and zombie-like poses.  \n\nMy wife insisted on picking up some seasonal items here, but if only I had known the horror of this store I would have avoided it. \n\nAlso, this store had an above average number of annoying type personalities shopping there."
2,Vegas Trip 545PM\nThis is just the thing you do after a buffet. Go to chocolate factory called M&M World. Just trying to spend some time with my friends kids so we decided to take them to this place. OMG thet went wild on this place go here go there just can't control this little bastards...OPPSSS Did i say that? Well moving on they reach 2nd floor with no problem and there it is the machine with all the M&M on it different color different taste different size. Kids grab some bags and off they go filing the bags they have which you know they won't even eat... All this is a phase where if you see it you gotta have it. This is located off the strip you won't miss it for the world you will see a big yellow and blue m&m statue outside the building wall right beside the coke world which we did not check out. maybe next time. This place is all that it says on the brochures yummy m&m cheap all the toys and shirts w/ M&M logo on it. will i come back...YES!!!
3,"Great serving size, actually extremely large serving size. The smallest sandwich offered here is a pound of meat! Crazy!\n\nI love coming here, fresh meat, friendly staff and quick service.\n\nMy reason for only giving 4 stars, is the seating in here is accommodating for a lot of people so tables are very close together. I felt as if I was enjoying lunch with people in both sides of us. \n\nOverall great experience, a little expensive but most of Vegas is. I'd go back the next time I'm in town."
0,"Gross as gross can be you'll never catch me!  - Eating here ever again!!!\n\nAirports are not all notorious for their gourmet, reasonably priced restaurants, but this place made me feel taken advantage of.  \n\nAs the only place to grab a drink while waiting an hour and a half to board my flight I excitedly headed toward Jackalope Flats.  It's walls are peppered with vintage household items and of course that adorable little jackalope we all know and love.  \n\nThe menu is pretty basic, chili, salads, nachos, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Turkey Club - Sliced Turkey, Swiss Cheese, Crispy Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Spicy Chipotle Honey Mayo on Sourdough Bread - sounds good!\n\nWRONG!\n\nThe meat is the worst quality, water pressed \""turkey\"" and the cheese was Swiss American ( a couple sparse holes and little flavor ).  The mayo tasted more sweet than spicy and the bread was so hard it cut the roof of my mouth.  I couldn't even eat the sandwich, it was so horrible.  \n\nI guess the beer is the only good thing here because I ordered a mimosa that my server recommended to me.  The champagne was flat and warm.  When I asked the bar if they could remake it since it was flat and showed them the absence of all bubbles he offered to pour some soda water in it to add some \""fizz\"".  \n\nHonestly, this place isn't worth the money I'm spending.  If this places wasn't in the airport, there is zero chance it would survive."
3,"Loved this place, especially their weekend hours! We came right before midnight after some bar hopping and needing a late night snack. This place seems like it is in a residential neighborhood but was very welcoming with a cool vibe. \n\nThere was a great selection of sweet and savory crepes - we went with one stuffed with ricotta and topped with chocolate and almonds, as well as one stuffed with peanut butter and chocolate. They were both so soft, delicious and satisfying! We took them down with some fresh coffee to cap off a great evening!"
4,"i went here to get my tooth extracted, and i was scared and frightened like crazy. This dentist has to be the best dentist i've ever experienced. i didnt feel any pain and he made me feel at ease, before i knew it the tooth was out. I will definetly refer him my family members."
0,"I was staying at the MGM Grand this past weekend.  I was playing poker for most of Sunday, but around noon I needed a little something something while waiting for dinner later that night.  The Stage Deli was right there near the poker room and there's no line.  Close and easy, two of my favorite characteristics of a restaurant.  So I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.\n\nThe sandwich was expensive - nearly $8.00.  Kind of to be expected in a casino.  OK.  I can deal.\n\nI'm not sure I would actually call the meat inside the sandwich chicken.  It was some sort of processed, white, rubbery chicken imposter.\n\n((pause))\n\nI paused for a few minutes to think of some other substance on the planet that I could liken this chicken to, and I can't.  It must be from another world.\n\nIt was absent of any flavor, and had it not been for the lettuce, tomato and mayo i put on the sandwich, it may have been one of the least flavorful lunches of all-time.\n\nThe sesame bun wasn't very fresh.  It had that \""I've been sittin out for several hours\"" taste to it.  And the pickle that accompanied the \""sandwich\""  wasn't cold and fresh; it was luke-warm and limp.\n\nA complete let-down.\n\nTo make matters worse, the girl who took the order barely stopped talking in spanish to her cooks standing a few feet away.  I ordered and she talked right through the order.  Pretty freakin' rude if you ask me.\n\nI'd choose 0 stars if it was a choice.  Stay away from Stage!"
3,"Was here for dinner. As soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a cabin up north. Very nice and cozy. We started with a mix of oysters which were very tasty and the smoked duck which was much better than i had imagined. I ordered the lamb shoulder and as my main and it was extremely succulent and cooked to perfection. The menu is nit very big but i could have easily ordered any of the dishes as they all sounded good. For dessert we had an apple crumble which was nice and warm with a scoop of whisky ice cream on top. The whole bill came to $166 plus tax and tip. We each ordered 2 drinks each, so for all that the price is very reasonable for the area. Our waiter was extremely friendly and took his time explainable all the specials and was always there right when we needed anything. There are parking lots and spaces right outside and it is located right in old Montreal which is a huge plus."
3,"Just had lunch here last week.  I was happy with it.  I had the brisket.  It was tasty and exactly was I was expecting and craving.  The beans were more like a chili and completely the yummiest form of comfort food. \n\nThe owners and employees are so nice, it's wonderful to see places like this with good people owning it.  I left think, \""what fine, lovely people\""-- I plan to head back out and try more things on the menu.  oh, the cobbler was very very very good.  Did I say very enough?"
2,"Very nice property, awesome views of the lake with a relaxing effect.\nHowever, the pool area and bar close way too early. I would expect more out of the price tag it come with. Rooms were very clean and definitively a relaxing experience, but the nightlife in the hotel and its surrounding areas is seriously deprived, unless you want to drive 45+ mins to the Strip."
1,"I wish I could give this place a higher rating, but I've had continuous questionable experiences here. I am, without a doubt, very impressed by their sushi. I love to just order their lunch special because it's the cheapest and always comes out perfect. It includes a yummy salad, miso soup and your choice of two delicious rolls.\n\nI have yet to have a bad piece of sushi here. I think you can literally order any type of sushi and I can guarantee it will be authentic (as far as Champaign, IL goes). There's just a very long wait and not very many legitimate servers to refill drinks. If you have a lot of time on your hands to have their great sushi, then I recommend going here at least once. I'm sure you will have enough of it after waiting an hour and a half for your order to come out."
2,"I want to love Massage Envy. And in fact, considering I've been a member for at least 4 years now, you'd think I definitely love this place.  But I don't. \n\nWell, actually this location, facilities and people are a-ok. It's the silly guidelines set by corporate that are apparently forcibly followed by this and every other location that just drive me mad.  For example, my most recent membership was initiated from a location in DC. So because of that I will forever be a DC member despite no longer living there. So I get no reminder calls, no appointment reminder calls, and cannot get my billing corrected without calling DC. And I know I'm not the only one with the perpetual annoyance of having to deal with 2 offices on separate sides of the country for billing. I've heard at least 3 others at the counter talking to practically a wall in trying to get their account properly transferred (here's a tip-I've tried 3 times and I've finally accepted that it will never, ever, ever happen). \n\nMy regular masseuse is absolutely ahhhhhhhhhhhhh-mazing and worth waiting for, even though she has hours that are entirely incompatible with my work schedule. Love her!!!"
4,Stayed here in SEPT 2009 for my sister's Bachlorette party!  We had the suite it was stunning with a view.  Also the staff was friendly as usual. The valet staff are always nice too!  We enjoyed our stay here I must say. I absolutely LOVE the Mandalay Bay pool the best I've seen :)
0,Bueno Burger is much better. Five guys is better. McDonalds is better!
1,"OK, it's greasy, it's got burned coffee, it's filling and all at Las Vegas prices.  It does alright in a pinch, but if you can manage to go someplace else, please do.  On my own, I'd eat here and not complain, but if you're with somebody else, say your wife who is much less tolerable than yourself when it comes to greasy food and burned coffee, you might want to venture out."
4,"Everything we got was amazing, the cheese curds were perfect. I can honestly say this was the best burger I have had in Madison. The Prime Rib was delicious as well. Great atmosphere. Best bar"
4,"Fran, your food is filling. So filling. And sooo delicious. Hubs and I dropped by for a casual dinner and pretty much ordered way too much. Big shocker, I know, but really we couldn't help ourselves. The menu was filled with comfort food goodness. \n\nInside, Fran's is really adorable. There are about 15 tables and a small bar right at the front. All the servers seem to work together to greet, seat and take care of their customers. I'm a big fan of teamwork. \n\nOnce we settled in at the bar, we started with the Fried Pickles and were happy to see a huge portion - one side was spiced, while the other was plain. The flavor was right on and the breading was nice; my only suggestion would be to crisp them up a bit more. For my meal, I ordered the Latin Wedge Salad which is filled with yumness - corn, roasted red peppers, iceberg, creamy sherry vinaigrette, avocado, boatload of cheese and grape tomatoes. The salad was one of the best I've had in Charlotte; it was super flavorful and ginormous. \n\nAnd of course, I had to try the Mac 'n Cheese, just for research purposes. Holy yum. Again, a huge portion for $6. It's absolutely a meal and half on its own. Per Fran, who is just incredibly sweet and friendly, her 'mazing mac includes cheddar, American and pecorino cheese. The service in total was top notch - all the servers were knowledgeable, laid back and offered great suggestions for we first timers. Although, I was clearly super full, I ordered the Chocolate Cake, again, just to see how it was. (Yeah right) \n\nNow, I'm a huge chocolate fan, but not always a cake fan because of the potential dry factor. I am delighted to say that the chocolate cake was fantastic - moist cake, delectable frosting (not too thick) and a huge scoop of whipped cream AND ice cream. You can say I made room for dessert and planned a long run for the next morning. \n\nI left Fran's Filling station with a super full belly, a huge bag of leftovers and the notion that I certainly want to be a regular here!"
1,"The was my second meal in Vegas. The price point for this Restaurant is more than I originally thought after looking at the stats on here. \n\nThe service was ok. We had three waiters, but some how drinks were not brought to the table until after dinner. When one of the girls told him they no longer wanted the drink because we were leaving dinner he still brought it out and charged us for it. LARGE GROUPS BEWARE they will NOT SPLIT CHECKS, which is a little awkward for the end of dinner when everyone has to pool together to pay. \n\nThe food was alright. Not bad but not great. Two of the girls had to send back their steaks because they were WAY over cooked. It took the entire rest of the meal to get them back (they wanted rare steaks). And like I said for the price you are paying for these steaks they should be done correctly. The veggies were overcooked and not all that enjoyable. The Adult tater tots, mack and cheese, and mashed potatoes were good (they have the carbs down). \nFind another steak house if you want steak, I would even venture to say Ruth's Chris Steak out in Charlotte has better steaks."
3,"I love this store for years now. I discovered it here.\nThe candles are wonderful. I love the little travel sampler kit. \nThe yuzu bergamot moisturizer is great. \nI enjoy the soaps. \nThis is the type of store that you just go for the product and know it is just going to cost more. Honestly it is not the much for many items: The little kits like the:\n- cranberry orange body wash 2 oz\n- cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz\n- mint thyme body wash 2 oz\n- mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz\n- bamboo creme body wash 2 oz\n- bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz\n- packaged in a reusable zippered bag\nall for 25 bucks. \n\n clove soap 2 oz\n- honey almond soap 2 oz\n- lavender lime soap 2 oz\n- lemongrass soap 2 oz\n- oatmeal lavender soap 2 oz \n- rosemary soap 2 oz \n- rosemary & peppermint soap 2 oz\n- rose tangerine lavender soap 2 oz\n- seven seed lemon & rosemary soap 2 oz\n- vetivert & grapefruit soap 2 oz\n- wild mint soap 2 oz \n- yuzu soap 2 oz\nfor 38 bucks.\n\n- bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz \n- mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz \n- lavender lime moisturizer 2 oz \n- yuzu bergamot moisturizer 2 oz \n- cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz \n- sweet almond & sea kelp moisturizer 2 oz \n- zippered travel bag \nfor 25 bucks..\nWhy yes you just read my Stocking stuffers for myself that I just sent my husband. hehe :D  \nWorth trying. You will find a favorite. \n\nQuality of their ingredients from their website:\n\""...using only pure essential oils, vitamins and antioxidants, and rare fruits and herbs - and never using synthetic fragrances or colors. Now, we're also sourcing organic ingredients when possible, and are on track to have all of our products be paraben-free and SLS/ALS-free by mid-2010. \""\nService: She was very nice and was even happier when she saw I was a little shop happy when I started putting everything on the counter. hehe.\nFrom St. Louis and loved it!\nTLDR:  The products are a favorite of mine. Good products and good service at this location. Great outdoor mall."
2,"Tips:\nKnow which building you are going to (there are 3)\nPrepare to pay and spend time for parking if you are going to be there beyond 2 hours(first time I parked at Chase after leaving the Hyatt valet spending $12, the next day I parked for free but was 1 mile away)\nThere are plenty of staff who can direct you where to go...as long as you know the building and room number\n\nCame here for Rock and Roll and the Western Regional Dental Convention. Well, I loved the dental convention! (I hate being forced into pre-race packet pick ups). I came back the next day for the Academy of General Dentistry regional meeting and was shocked it was $200 to rent a small room for a meeting and only on site food is allowed where cans of soda go for $4 a pop!"
1,The place smelled like smoke right as we walked in the door. Ok beer list. Glass wine prices are high. Standard bar food.
3,"Welcome Hipsters, one and all. What can I say that hasn't already been said? I enjoy this place, it is open, busy, and when in Tempe it is one of the better places to go. Great beers and the food is actually damn good, go earlier if you are not trying to bump into the other patrons."
1,Usually a great place. I went this time and no sugar free option. At least one sugar free flavor should be the norm.
0,I currently live at Spectrum and am waiting for my lease to end so I can move. These apartments absolutely have a bug problem. I've asked to have exterminators come twice and still have bugs. The new management team is unhelpful and incompetent. Of the few times I've asked for help there was none plus bogus fees and incorrect/ inaccurate information. For some reason it takes 4 days for them to change a light bulb in my apartment and three calls to fix my broken toilet. Currently I am waiting for a call back from the complex manager. I won't hold my breath. I'm sure you will have a good experience moving in here like these people who are giving 5 star reviews but good luck after that. If there was a 0 star button I'd use it
2,"Took my girl out for Valentine's Day and dinner at Red Square.  We made reservations a couple of days prior with no problem.  The restaurant was not overly busy considering the occasion.\n\nRed Square has a truly impressive vodka list...if you like Vodka.  They have numerous specialty martinis and cocktails as well.  Casual and hardcore alcoholics alike will undoubtedly find something to their tastes.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and entrees.  I had the filet with crabmeat and she had the pork with asparagus and sweet potatoes.  We topped things off with a very nice creme bruele.\n\nThe food was very good with very nice presentation.  Ambience on the other hand left much to be desired.  The tables are very crowded and it was often difficult to focus on our conversation as it became a chore to try to tune out the conversations of those around us.  To say the tables are too close together would be an understatement.\n\nNot bathroom in the actual restaurant was a real downer.  No patron of any restaurant should be told to leave the restaurant in order to go to the restroom.  Big minus points there.\n\nOverall the food was good.  The decor was themed perfectly and very attractive.  However, the lack of any real intimate space and lack of onsite bathroom facilities necessitate the 3 star rating."
2,"They got me all excited for eggs benedict and then killed my eggy dreams, but it was still alright.\n\nI was mega jazzed when I sat down and the menu showed eggs benedict. When I asked the waiter about some of the details of the dish, he revealed that there wasn't any English muffin at the base like there usually is. Instead, the egg, meat and sauce rested on a bed of potatoes. No thanks. I love my eggs benedict with the soggy muffin at the bottom. \n\nI decided to go with a basic 2 egg breakfast after hearing that. It wasn't extra special. It was okay. \n\nI liked the store attached to the other side of the restaurant. They had lots of Tokidoki and Hello kitty items available."
4,"The \""New York, New York\"" hotel and casino in Vegas is very much a microcosm of Las Vegas itself.  You can find all kinds of examples of humanity within.  Bros, bro hoes, preppy types, hipsters, wanna be's, classy people...you name it - you can find it there.  Its a smaller version of the \""barely organized chaos\"" that exists outside on Vegas' strip.  Because of the way its laid out with the casinos, the shops, all the eateries and that various \""neighborhoods\"", Ny Ny can best be described as cacophonous.\n\nBut nestled within this little den of chaos is a relative haven of tranquility and mellowness known as Nine Fine Irishmen.  For those of you who don't know (and really... what are there.. like 4 of you out there still left?), it models itself as an Irish Pub right out of Dublin.  The wife and I have been here twice in our wanderings; most recently for lunch and a pint of ale.  \n\nWithout a doubt, this is a great place to rest, relax and recharge yourself with a pint of ale or perhaps a shot of whiskey and grab a bite to eat.  My fave drink here is a \""Black Velvet\"", a lovely concoction of Stout and Cider that is the perfect parity tween sweet and strong.\n\nThe food is excellent too.  Highly recommended is the Fish n Chips.  The fish, never frozen, is delicious and served traditionally in a paper \""funnel\"" along with the thick chips.  Also of note is their corn beef sandwich - which included generous portions of meat.  They also have traditional Anglo fare, like Shepherd's Pie and Bangers and Mash.\n\nOne of the nicest things about this place is when you walk in - all the sounds and chaos of the casino and goings on outside become dull and muted causing your cares to drift away.  Of course, having a pint or two doesn't hurt either!.  Its a very relaxing, mellow atmosphere.  Except after 10pm, that is.  Then it becomes a raucous and happening nightclub.\n\nThe place is a *tad* pricey - but only just a tad.  There are far more expensive places to eat and drink - but really, the quality of everything is worth it!\n\nThe employees..bartenders...waitresses...everyone, are very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waitress, Tracy I think her name was, even knew what a \""Snug\"" was in regards to pubs - and pointed out that they had three of them!  Woot!\n\nSimply put, Nine Fine Irishmen is the perfect spot at the perfect place in Vegas.  An oasis of solemnity in the middle of a vast ocean of glorious chaos.  A must-visit kind of place when you want to settle down with a drink and recharge your inner-battery after strolling up and down the strip."
2,The food is decent but the service has been just ok every time i've been there.  The food isn't plated well but hey it's still good.  We do continue to go there once in awhile but not as often as some other place we regular.  One thing I must say is that they will validate your parking so take advantage of that.
3,"I'm happy to report that my second experience here was much better than my first.  \n\nThis time around, service was wonderful.  The chips are clearly house made and delicious (they even sneak some fried flour tortilla chips in your basket - bonus).  The margaritas are cranium-sized and quite tasty.  My fish tacos were somewhat untraditional but yummy nonetheless.  \n\nThe restaurant has a beautiful view of the mountains.  It adds a lot of great ambiance. \n\nThis space has been home to a number of places...  I hope this one makes it."
3,Ordered teriyaki chicken and it was good. The order was freshly made so it took a bit longer. Good customer service and clean shop.
3,"*****This place calling itself Bachi Burger may throw some off it's Bao meets, Boba, meets grillarama****** \n\nI wish these guys had got in before the Subway on the corner of the building it's a much better spot. The interior is really not to my liking too stark and boring. They are new so this may change but it really seems like it was the look that they were going for. The staff was nice though the waitresses seemed nervous and uncomfortable it's all new so I am looking past all of this. I had the Kalbi burger it was really good I'm a kimchi fan so it was right up my alley. This thing is messy as hell in a good way 4 napkin minimum. My only wish on my burger was that they use a rougher cut of Kimchi. The salt and pepper fries are solid they toss a few jalapenos in for effect as well. On the drinks side they have a good selection of beers although they are a little up there in price if I'm paying 7 dollars for a Sapporo it had better be a large format bottle. I will definitely go back if for nothing else to tear through all the Bao selections and have an order of fish & chips. One note, the buns are a little sweet and may throw some off, I thought they were great and very fresh."
0,Horrible first experience! First time I went there I told her I was new to getting lashes. She didn't care to take the time to show me the different options. I expressed how I wanted ravishing to make my lashes fuller not longer to keep my length. After almost 3 hrs in appointment she apparently didn't listen to what I had to say. They were much longer than I wanted and she didn't add any volume. \n\nI had to go in the next day to get my lashes corrected. They said I had 30 mins. The lashes weren't only to long but were moving everywhere and the glue was on my eye where I cannot even put liner on. After 30 mins she had half the lashes removed and said I was done. I had then to ask her what did I pay for if she put them on and then off. \n\nShe said let me ask and came back to say she would give me more time as if it was a favor for her to do her job correctly. After another 2.5 hrs the length was what I want but the fullness wasn't ravishing like I expected. My lashes are still moving and the right eye hurts when putting on my contacts off and on and I was told by a friend who gets them done all the time it is due to placement. \n\nNeedless to say after 6 hrs and 2 days. I will never come here again.
2,"party of 2. had reservations for 630, arrived at 615 and were seated right away. when i called originally i asked for a seat by the window. they said they cant guarantee it but noted it and would try. we sat one  table away from the window, which still made for an amazing view. however the people right against the window were paying the bill and we asked if we could move over once they left. the server was very nice and said no problem after asking the host. this happened after we ate our salads. he busted the table quickly and made the little move very smooth and easy. the view is totally amazing. i ate here in the winter, and looking below at the deck, during the summer im sure it would be even a bit better. the food i have to say was a little disappointing. i heard the food is very good here, but i wasnt too impressed. my fillet was very avgerage, for an above average price. garlic mashed potatoes were decent. the salad with house dressing was way too small, it was tiny and pretty plain, i really liked the dressing though. the steak sauce that came with my fillet, which normally id never use any sauce, but i tried a bite with it, and the sauce was very good and i finished my steak using it. the 12oz sirloin was the other dish ordered and i finished her last 4 bites, actually, i had only 2 bites, as it was awful i thought. very tough and dry. she had green beans as her side which were ok. no dessert,. her two vodka martinis were very good and priced right as was my beers. its 3 stars because the service was good. our waiter was very nice and made the meal better because with his good service. and the view is unreal and the atmosphere and decor are very nice. although there is a tv mounted on the wall in the dining room which seemed very out of place. if it was on, it would kill the intimate, romantic vibe that it offers. maybe its there for the staff to watch while the place is closed?  because i couldnt see why it would ever be on any other time. the bar downstairs is very nice and you can still get the view. its pretty small, but a perfect place to have drinks before or after the meal. after tip it was exactly $100, which included 2 kettel one martinis, and 2 beers, no dessert.  overall i liked the restaurant, i liked the cozy feeling there, the big windows, friendly staff, i just wish the food was a little better as it was very average."
4,"I tried the Kalbi and Bulgogi, it was yummy! We couldn't believe how soft the meat was even after we burnt it! Haha! The vegetables were all fresh. I really enjoy the sliced daikon and Kim Chee! Also the staff was very nice and \""on it\"", we never had to ask for anything! Then after we stuffed ourselves, there was still room for dessert! They have this liquid thing that looks like watered down honey! Try it! It taste like ginger and cinnamon! It was so good, I had seconds and thirds of that! It's suppose to cleanse your palette. So basically, it's like green tea for Japanese food. But it's served cold and so much better! In fact I'm gonna go to Chinatown today and see if anywhere sells it, it was that good! Now I can say I finally ate at that place with the sign, U cook, U eat! It was bomb! Better and cheaper than Sura down the road! This is now our place to eat Korean food!"
4,Great dumplings! Cheap too!
1,"I originally reviewed Hy-Vee based on their first day open. Now that the new car smell has faded, how have they stood up to over a year of regular grocery shopping?\n\nIn a word... Meh.\n\nThe staff is no longer particularly helpful; you have to go out of your way to flag someone down if you have a question. The selection is decent, but not as good as it first appeared. The kitchen now charges extra if you want rice -- just plain white rice -- with your hot Chinese food. \n\nWorst of all is their dishonest pricing policies. I can't count the number of times I've seen a big sale price sign for one thing placed over a different, more expensive item, or an item marked at, say, 2.99 one day, and literally the very next day marked with \""price decline\"" at 3.99.\n\nIt's not a bad grocery store... But why come here when there's a much wider selection and lower prices just 2 minutes away at Woodman's?"
3,"Tex Az is a one of our favorite places to take/meet up with people in Central Phoenix...especially folks from out of town that are thinking that Arizona restaurants should be in a saloon-type atmoshere to be considered \""local\"".  \n\nWe take the newbies from out of town here pretty frequently.  It seems alot more \""genuine\"" to most than going to a place like, say, Rawhide.\n  \nI grew up on a cattle farm...and KNOW good steak.  The steak we get at Tex Az is well aged and has great flavor.  The cut, in my expereince, is usually great, as well.  No disappointments there.  (try the NY Strip) Presentation is basic, but isn't that what you would expect? You are not paying Ruth's Chris' prices, right?\n\nBest appetizer--Their chili!  it is VERY tasty and very hearty.  Best dessert--the bread pudding.\n\nWhile the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite non-plain-steak entree--we have recently converted to the fried chicken.  It is very good. \nWith both \""chicken fried\"" dishes,  the left-over reheating capability is pretty important since you get SO MUCH food...so the chicken wins out on this one..the Chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak.  \n\nThe atmosphere is...well...it is UNIQUE...and isn't that what you want in your local saloon/steak house.  :0)  The service is equally as local/quirky.  We consider it ambiance and character. I don't think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there, as a note.  \n\nParking can be a bit challenging on a busy night..but it all adds to the \""charm\"".  \n\nWe have likely been to Tex Az about 25 times over the years.  Not once were we disappointed...but we know what we are signing up for.  \n\nThis isn't gourmet--a spear of asparagus would not dare show its face at Tex Az--but it is traditional type hearty Old West fare and the flavor is simple, yet great!!!"
1,"Pizza Hut never tastes the same. This location tasted unusually different. The best Pizza Hut is in anthem highlands. Next time I'm in the mood for pizza, I'll be going to them."
3,"Kobe cheeseburger or sliders are always a win. Holy hell the garlic fries aren't joking about the garlic, but they ARE delicious."
1,"Hello House of Crap. \n\nI can't imagine that any of us need any of this stuff. But if you feel that you need a duck pot holder, Vegas shot glass, crappy t-shirt, key chain or used casino cards - head on down to the World's largest gift shop!"
3,"I'm a big fan of Jean-Georges restaurants, and Prime is no exception.\n\nThe blue curtains and velvet chairs are stunningly elegant.  The food is wonderful.  \n\nThe biggest drawback?  They don't have outdoor seating.  Prime does have the outdoor garden/patio area, which is about as close as you can get to the fountain show, but it's only for cocktails.  I think Steve Wynn's group learned from that oversight as he thought through Botero and the SW Steakhouse.  Once you experience the settings at those places, it's hard to overlook it at Prime.  \n\nYou'll have up close views of the fountain show here, but the better views of it are across the street at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant."
3,"Closed, soon to be replaced by \""Teriyaki Time\"".  We shall see."
1,"Horrible.  Very, very Midwestern Mexican.  (Disclaimer: I grew up in the midwest, but I have traveled and had Mexican and Southwestern food, and I've enjoyed trying the many Mexican themed restaurants in town.)  \n\nChips were okay - crispy and pretty tasty.  Salsa was okay.  Chips and salsa were, probably, the best part of the meal.  So, +1 star for chips and decent service.\n\nMy girlfriend wasn't feeling well, and wanted something lighter and got the guacamole salad.  What she received was a plate of iceberg lettuce, shredded white cheese, and very salty guacamole.  The guacamole tasted like it came out of a jar.  The combination was exactly as appetizing as it sounds.\n\nI got a burrito plate.  The burrito was not wrapped up.  It just had some filling dumped into it and had been shoved into an oven, so the edges of the tortilla had become hard and browned.  It was impossible to pick up and broke into pieces when I tried.  The filling itself consisted of stewed, mushy beef with stewed, mushy tomatoes and onions.  The sides were forgettable.   I really hate to throw away leftovers, especially if I think they can be jazzed up somehow, but that's what I ended up doing with the rest of the burrito.\n\nYou do get a lot of food on your plate, but if it's bland Mexican that's very, very reminiscent of what you can get out of a box at the supermarket, why bother?  \n\nIf you'd like better Mexican, try Huaraches Moroleon or Mas Amigos.  Or Taco Loco.  Cocina Real and Dos Reales aren't my favorites, but they're still better than here.  (I haven't been to Maize and can't comment on it.)  \n\nIf you wish there was a Burrito King off campus, this is pretty much it.  Except they do, at least, leave off the salty white cheese sauce here.  Overall, I would avoid this place and go to one of many places that is cheaper, more charming, and more authentic."
4,"Second visit tonight for dinner.  The Fish with Golden Peppers is absolutely delicious!  Highly recommend.  And, I am one of those people that is weird about fish, so if I like it, you know it's good!"
1,"This is the scariest haunted house in the country?  Who bribed the reviewers?  If this is the best this nation can muster, I weep for Halloween.\n\nThe Nest has a truly paranormal ability to disappoint.  Someone has obviously put a lot of cash and effort into promotion, but regrettably, the only truly frightening element is the cost of a ticket.  I'm chalking it up to poor management.\n\nI'm going to dissect why you should keep your cash in your pocket, but I'm leaving out the spoilers (though frankly, I doubt it would detract much from the experience).\n\nLet me start with some positives.  The settings are decent, as are the costumes.  The Nest clearly has some talented folks working in the background.  In particular, several sections make use of props and optical illusions in a manner that would be downright thrilling under other circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the actors are fabulous.  They obviously take pride in attempting to induce mental anguish in their patrons.  Granted we caught them early in the night, but they were mighty enthusiastic set of freaks.\n\nTheir employer, however, does not live up to their standards.\n\nFirst, the venue is a large agricultural warehouse.  This means that the entire haunted \""house\"" is a series of plywood-partitioned cubicles, most with open ceilings.  Ambient noise constantly leaked from adjoining rooms, giving away any kind of surprise the next room might hold.  Frankly, it reminded me of the haunted houses my junior high organized in the gym every year--far from enough to suspend my disbelief.\n\nSecond, the crowds literally overwhelmed the place, and management clearly values quantity over quality.  Patrons were churned through on each others' tail, seldom giving the actors a moment to resume their positions.  How shocked can you be when the same zombie has already jumped out at two different groups only a few feet ahead of you?  How disturbing is a butchered corpse when a cluster of text-messaging teenagers are blocking your path?  The fright only diminishes further when you spend most of the experience shoved firmly against a portly stranger's backside.\n\nAnd, despite the pace of admissions, there was still a line.  Three, to be precise: one at the entry, and two more in the middle.  I'd say bring a snack for the wait...but you can't.\n\nOf course, you could always choke up another ten bucks for the VIP pass, but even the VIPers faced solid (albeit shorter) lines.  You can waste your time, or you can waste your money--your choice.\n\nThird, like the majority of Phoenix events, the actual product is a pathetic shadow of its promotion.  The website advertises an intricate legend of a local murderer that is apparently totally unrelated to all but the last handful of rooms, and even then, the connection is tenuous.  And, of course, the aggressive local advertising campaign keeps the herds flooding in.\n\nAnd finally...that price tag.  Yeesh.  Sure, I might pay to go here.  Seven or eight bucks, tops.  Ten if you catch me on a payday.\n\nBut between the outrageous cost and the lingering feeling that I've been scammed, I won't be going next year.  Let me know if it ever improves."
4,"SO DELICIOUS.  This place sells coffee, cold and hot sandwiches, salads, and various gorgeous pastries that rival Laduree in presentation and taste.\n\nI had a croque monsieur which was really delicious, albeit a bit small.  My friends and I split a cobb salad, which was good (your basic cobb).  \n\nThe real standouts here are the pastries, which look freaking amazing (I uploaded some pics).  I ate the \""Intense,\"" which is a chocolate mousse covered in a dark chocolate ganache and topped with a little macaron.  The chocolate taste was very rich and dense, the mousse light and fluffy, and the macaron perfectly chewy.\n\nI want to eat here again."
2,"This place is really cute and obviously if you've seen the movie Serendipity, it'll get you excited to dine here.\n\nI was kind of bummed since I didn't think their regular dining menu was all that impressive.  I had the lemon chicken but wasn't spectacular.\n\nIf anything, I think this place is a great go-to place for desserts as I am in love with their frozen hot chocolate is what they're famous for.  It is delicious!  \n\nProbably will stop in again for desserts again but not for main course eating."
2,Pretty darn good!\nFast delivery (took way less than 45-50 min) although I will say ordering was a bit of a process due to some language barriers (on both ends). The\nSesame chicken was fairly crispy as requested and the sauce was not sickeningly sweet thankfully and had a nice flavor! For $8 combo with rice and choice of spring roll or egg roll it was a pretty cheap dinner. The crab rangoon were delicious and perhaps my favorite part of the meal. Not sure what was up with the fried rice without egg or veggies or anything ...I'm not sure if it is a Charlotte thing but the last two places I've gone have been like this. I also wasn't a huge fan of their egg-rolls - since I prefer mine with a little more flavor. \n\nI will give it another shot because I thought the chicken sauce was one of the best I've had in a long time.
2,Not too bad but right next to light rail line.  Easy in and out.
2,"I ordered a gyro, it smelled like a gyro, but when I got home I realized they forgot the gyro :( \n\nInstead I got a side of gyro meat & rice. I at e a little bit & the meat wasn't bad, but alas, I needed something more!"
4,"GREAT! a little crowded but that happens when you have amazing food and great service. The corn on the cob with chipotle crema is soooo good. The chimichurri steak was delicous as was the guacamole. Our server was super sweet and very patient with our sarcastic, fun-loving table. Cannot wait to go back. Creative and somewhat fancy Mexican. Five Stars!"
2,"At Lee's liquor and decided to call in a order.   $25 for two rainbow rolls, wtf!! Waited at least 20 minutes for my food to go and the place was empty!!! The roll was less then desirable and I didn't even finish it!!! Grrrrrr... Get it together sumo!!"
4,"I work in the Biltmore area and I was happy to see this place open.  My hair was cut by a gentleman named Nate and this was simply one of the best, if not the best, haircut I received in quite sometime.   If you're looking for a good cut at prices that are not outrageous then I highly recommend this place.  \n\nI'll review my shaving experience in about a week."
2,"Before I begin, let me give y'all a quick breakdown of how I like to rate things - I don't throw out 4 and 5 stars for the sheer heck of it.  I mean c'mon now- 5 stars belong to well, FIVE star businesses who represent FIVE star standards.  I'm not going to rate establishments on Forbes or AAA ratings by any means (unless it's a fine dining restaurant or a Resort), but I'm not going to just hit the five or four star button for giggles.  \n\nWith that being said, I think I'm actually quite generous with MadHouse Coffee.  I'll give them the extra star based on the fact that the cafe latte that I ordered was actually pretty good.  Not EXCELLENT but good.  \n\nI would give them two stars based on the fact that the \""barista\"" didn't really know what when into what.  You should really know if a certain beverage has sugar in it or not or the type of milk that goes in it.  \n\nAlso when we walked in they were mopping the floors and didn't even bother to remove the bucket that was right in the middle of the place.  In such a small area - anything on the floor takes up way too much room and extremely dangerous.  Cleanliness is top notch in my book, and I appreciate the efforts to provide a clean store, however- please remove the bucket when you're done!  I didn't realize that it was still behind me when I took a step back and almost fell over it.  \n\nAside from that, the place is pretty hip, and I'd choose their latte over Starbucks any day, but I was far from overly impressed."
3,"I've been on a huge Mediterranean kick lately and I love this lunch spot. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and accommodating. I really like that, even after the order has been placed and I've received my food, the staff comes by to check and make sure everything is good. It's a nice touch for a 'fast food' type restaurant. \n\nI generally order the chicken pita. It is marinated then rotisserie'd chicken covered in also marinated tomatoes, cucumbers and olives. On top of that - dressed lettuce, and feta cheese. The pita it is served in is soft and delicious and it comes with a side of French fries. I also like that this location has one of those new Coca Cola Freestyle Machines. Vanilla Diet Dr. Pepper rocks my world in a super serious way! \n\nThis place is always clean and there is plenty of seating inside and outside on their patio. I'm a regular here and I highly highly recommend!"
0,"DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT HORRIBLE SERVICE, SALMONELLA, and perhaps A SIDE OF OLD REUSED FOOD.\n\nIntro:\nComing here for lunchtime, we were greeted warmly.  That ends the only pleasant experience I had here thus far.  From the get-go, the server had an air of indifference around her, as if she didn't care about her job.  The way she treated myself and those in my party was as if we were the last people on her shift, and whatever needs may come before her would befell deaf ears.  When asked about certain menu items, the server was not clear in describing what was in each one.  Not only that, the food and drinks took forever to come.  We'll get to that later.\n\nService:\n-lack of service\n-server was disinterested in her job and showed it through her lackadaisical and indifferent demeanor\n-Slow in delivery of food and drinks\n-Never came to refill, and only when we sat for 40 min and raised our hands for the check did she come by to ask \""what else would you like\"". As if she ever cared.\n\nFood:\n-flat and tasteless soft drinks.  I even switched to ice tea, which was served warm and reused.\n-sushi: small and completely overpriced.  Not only did I feel ripped off, because the portions were barely enough to feed a preteen female, but the actual meal consited of 6 tiny california rolls each measuring 0.75 inches in diameter.  I myself weigh 130 lbs and am 5'10\"".  That's saying quite a lot.\n-messed up our order.  A person in my party requested 2 rolls of spicy tuna.  She came back with 1 roll of spicy tuna and 1 roll of california roll.\n-When asked what she would do with the california roll, the server stated, quote on quote, \""we reuse the sushi\"".  I reported this to the Arizona Department of Health Services afterwards.\n\nConclusion:\n-Will not come back here again.\n-Highly DO NOT recommend coming here."
3,"The food is very good.  Convenient location.  The immediate parking area is always full.  Won ton soup is wonderful.  Try the kung pow shrimp. The service is great, they are very friendly.  And yes they do deliver!  You can't beat the lunch specials!"
0,"Peek-a-Boo!\n\nEven though I can see you, I'm going to ignore you."
3,"I would give 3.5 to 4 stars.  We went on Sunday and had their brunch and unlimited mimosas.  This was an excellent way to sample most if not all of the items on the menu.  Liked the way you could order a couple of dishes, eat, order some more dishes and get a chance to digest what you just ate.  The food was good.  The mimosas were truly unlimited.  The waitress came often to our table to take more food orders and bring drinks.\n\nI would definitely go again and recommend the restaurant to friends."
4,"This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. The Golden Bite has ruined fish and chips for me forever. Because I will never - EVER - find a fish supper superior, or perhaps even equal, to the one I had this weekend from the Golden Bite.\n\nI travelled to Portobello with Moray L on the express mission of trying the legendary Bite Of Gold after reading Justin G's review, and we were the first ones in when the doors opened at 16:45. The man who greeted us over the counter could not have been happier if he had been a dog in a field full of squirrels. It doesn't seem an exaggeration to say that I suspect frying fish has been his lifelong passion.\n\nBecause we were so early, we got the first haddock to go into the fryer - clean, white haddock of gobsmacking, Jonah-swallowing proportions which the chap wobbled at us playfully before setting about the battering and frying.\n\nAt this point - minutes after the doors opened - the shop filled. I mean it properly filled. I know not how many of these were pilgrims like us, and how many were locals, but it's clear that the reputation of The Golden Bite's fish suppers is widely renowned. I was reaching five stars simply from the cleanliness, the rich frying smell, and the chap's jollity before I'd even put anything in my mouth, and when a small girl entered and he pulled down a teddy bear to wave at her, I was smitten with the place entirely. But the food. The food. The proof of the poisson is in the eating.\n\nOh. My. Wrapped lovingly in paper and carried down reverently to the seafront for consumption, these piscine Midas fillets were battered to crispy perfection, but still with the softer underside that makes a fish supper truly sensational. The chips - proper chip shop chips - were glorious and plentiful, but not so numerous as to prevent one from finishing the lustrous, luscious fishywishy that so enchanted both me and Moray. I need to go back. No, you don't understand. I NEED to go back. Now. And I don't think I will ever love a fish supper in quite the same way that I love the Golden Bite's."
1,"I must've ordered the wrong thing. Dangit. And I was so excited to try this place, too. I wanted to be bad and order the grilled cheese. But, I went with a salad. It's the Gruyere cheese that got me. I had to have it. Little did I realize that the lettuce they used would be your standard, boring iceburg. Ick. But, I did appreciate the combination of other flavors, and the thing was massive (took half with me for later). \n\nBut, since eating at ZuZu, I've decided that if you go out as a treat, don't order a salad. Order something that's going to atleast have a high start value, like the blue cheese fondue. \n\nAnyway...\nHave you ever had a roll so good that you thought it was laced with some addictive illegal substance? Uh, yeah. Cafe ZuZu's rolls are UN-believable. Too bad my request for seconds went unheard. I would have even paid for 'em. Words can't capture how tasty these rolls were - warm, fresh from the oven, fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. \n\nService was anything but stellar. Our server tried, I'll give her that. But she seemed a bit scattered. Good thing Paul, the host (and/or manager, not sure) came by to see how everything was... and to confess that, yes, even he is addicted to the rolls. \n\nWill I be back? Doubtful. I hate to valet park, and it's mandatory at Valley Ho. It's complimentary, of course, if you eat at ZuZu, but even then, you have to factor in a good tip on top of another good tip on top of the price for lunch... Seems like alot of effort, doesn't it? It'd be one thing if the food were worth it, but, like I said, I think I ordered the wrong thing. Even my lunch buddy, who had a green chile burger, said the food was just okay. \n\nCafe ZuZu, you get Cool Kid Points for trying, but I'm docking points off for poor execution."
3,"I see this more of a lunch joint. The food comes out fast and it's not going to weigh you down when you are back at your desk. Plus the value is excellent, not to mention that I found a coupon at 360Charlotte.com. As the name implies, it's either fish or chicken. I had the tilapia with pineapple salsa, plus rice and grilled zucchini, which turned out to be a fairly healthy meal (not sure how much butter is in the seasoned rice). It came out looking and tasting like a home cook meal and was quite delicious. It's true that the menu is somewhat limited so take their name seriously, don't go unless you are in the mood for grilled fish or piri piri chicken."
0,"I don't know how this airline stays in business.  The employees are rude, argumentative, unknowledgeable, and generally unhelpful.  Our flight from Las Vegas to WA was fairly standard, though trying to get a stewardess to attend to me was nearly impossible, the real issues began when we were departing from AK.  It turns out that Delta had cancelled our original departing flight and rescheduled us however they failed to notify us of any change.  When we called, extremely upset as you can imagine, they acted as if it was no big deal and how dare we be upset.  \n\nThe return flights were no better; stewardesses were gossiping about how this one pilot was a drunk and this one guy she knew got a worm in his eye from his trip to Mexico.  The final straw was when the stewardess placed a bag of garbage on my lap while she was reaching over to get the cup of the gentleman seated to my far right.  \n\nThis airline will never have my business again even if they are the last airline in service (which I can't believe would ever be the case)."
1,"At the beginning i was surprise with the presentation and transformation of mexican food to the trendy concepts. We ordered Yucat\u00e1n chicken skewers and unfortunately this dish did not bring even the half o the Yucat\u00e1n uniqueness and tasteful cuisine. For entree we ordered ribeye with chile ancho sauce with brussels sprouts, Anaheim chile relleno and blue corn tamale, the tamale was crap!, dry and lack of flavor, the brussels sprouts as nogada style was just ok. The meat was just ok not the highest quality. The coconut flake very cheap, lack of excitement and flavor, the pumpkin bread pudding is just ok, looks more like a deconstructed s'more . Bobby Flay you really disappointed me! All the critics about your food at food network was made with people lacking in mexican cuisine experience. Thanks for using mexican food but you need to keep learning."
3,"Classic, independent, college coffeehouse in a cool neighborhood."
3,"Really good breakfast spot!  At times the two-waitress-wait-staff can get overwhelmed and your water glass may go empty for a while.  But the food is good.  My usual order goes as follows: M/R steak and eggs, hashbrowns well done, 1/2 order biscuits and gravy, pancakes, 2 slices of wheat toast and some coffee.  Gets me over my hangover every time! Everything is always cooked the way it was ordered and fresh.  They also make fresh pastries on sight, but never had the room for 'em at the end of the meal. One of these days Alice..."
4,"I can't say enough about FBBC!  Jade is one of a kind (truly exceptional!) and her staff is equally amazing.  Despite having a lot of weight to lose, I don't feel out of place at FBBC.  The atmosphere is one of health and healthy habits, rather than being primarily focused on appearance.  Classes are challenging (modifiable if you have limitations), educational (Jade explains why certain exercises are especially beneficial, suggests things you can do outside of class, and ensures you're always using proper form), fun (each class is different), motivational (words of encouragement along w/ upbeat music) and I love that they're only 30 minutes!  Finding an hour can sometimes be a challenge, but 30 minutes is always doable (no excuses!).  I've tried pretty much every small to large gym in Madison and this is truly home -- you're not just a client, but a family member.  The additional support (outside of class) is what sets FBBC apart from the others.  My best gym and group exercise experience to date!"
2,"Went here for the second time for dinner with my boyfriend and we loved the food; the service not so much. \n\nWe ordered 3 entrees for the two of us and got green curry -our favorite, pad Thai - smelled funky to me so I did not enjoy it as much as the first time I had it, and a Thai special fried rice - it taste like my dad's friend rice so I like it but nothing special for it to be so expensive. \n\nThe service wasn't amazing. The servers were constantly on their phones which was off putting cause my boyfriend had a question about something and as he was asking, she just walked away and went back to her phone. \n\nNext time I'll just order to go."
0,"The worse \""mexican\"" food I have ever had! I am white and I can prepare more authentic mexican food. But can't expect much from a bar."
1,"Wow...what a cool restaurant.......Wish the food would have been better....\n\n1. Table by kitchen...fun to watch the various dishes go out.....lots of Wellingtons rare.\n\n2.

0,Definitely not even a 1 star rating but I have to put 1.  Spirit airlines suck!!! Got in exactly 45 mins before and the girl had the nerve to tell me planes already boarding. Which I know is bullshit. 45 mins is late check in time. WORSE SERVICE OVERALL. never flying with y'all again.
3,Yardhouse is one of the best Happy Hour's in Vegas.... Right before the Welcome sign in the heart of town square shopping mall this place is a gem. Best beer selection in town and great prices on everything.
4,"I have been extremely pleased with the care and knowledge offered here (and we tried others when we arrived three years ago). With two cats (formerly three) and a dog, we tend to be pretty good veterinary customers.\n\nEvery time we visit, we get plenty of attention from the doctors and staff. While they clearly are focusing their interest on the patient, they take the time to answer questions and explain things in simple and easy-to-understand terms. The \""take home\"" materials are also written in uncomplicated language.\n\nThe outer office is clean and well mopped. The files seem to be pretty organized and they are plugged in to technology, as we just got an email with our shot updates. The examination rooms are also very clean with plenty of room for \""mom and dad\"" to accompany the patient without it getting too crowded.\n\nPrices are reasonable and since we're \""regulars\"" they do give us the occasional discount on office visits and such. If we ever move to another part of Charlotte, we'll still come back to Long Animal Hospital!"
4,"A beautiful and newer property. This place is really nice. The casino is bigger than a lot of strip hotels and it's certainly newer than most. \n\nThe Buffet is reasonably priced especially if you get a players card. The downside is that it's a long drive from the airport or the strip. If you had to get a taxi it would cost you to get there, but you would save money on eating and rooms and really enjoy the place. \n\nA lot of locals come here for fun. I see why."
1,"I've been to this shop twice, the first time was just browsing and I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Today's visit was the exact opposite. I went to purchase some road cycling shoes. Since I've never owned any before I thought I'd go here and probably pay a little more but make sure I've got a good fit and a good shoe. I'm training for my first triathlon and told the guy that I wasn't sure if I wanted road shoes or tri shoes to go with my existing SPD pedals and cleats. He told me I'd have to swap my peddles if I wanted tri shoes, so I looked at some road shoes. I was trying to decide between two pairs when I thought I should at least look at/learn a bit about tri shoes. I picked up a pair and the tag said \""SPD Compatible\"". I asked the guy about this and he said that they didn't have my size. So he had  lied to me about having to change pedals just because he wouldn't be able to sell me the shoes!!! What a jerk. I don't think I could shop there again. Albeit, I'm a newb to cycling but had they done a nice job, they'd have won a customer for life."
1,"Excellent chicken that I like more than some of the other quick service tex-mex places; HOWEVER, the quesadilla comes with no extras. Salsa is 99 cents, quac us 99 cents.  I can understand the quac, although the portion size is a partially filled 2 oz container, but to pay for salsa??  The quac does not compare to chipotle. And I wouldn't pay for it again.  The rice and beans are decent, but I would gladly give them up for some salsa!"
0,The front office gal is always exceptionally rude. She seems bothered to have to do anything or talk to anyone. I dread going to this office because it is so unwelcoming.
3,We had a great breakfast here. I am glad to have them in the neighborhood. I am really sorry that it has such bad reviews below mine. But we met Joe and I am sure that he has taken these reviews seriously and will fix whatever the problems were that caused these negative reviews. The coffee was great. The meal was very good. The food fresh. The service was good. The only reason I didn't give five stars is I feel I want to go back time and time again to be sure of it's five star rating.
2,"I visited Bonterra on Valentine's Day a year or so ago and was very impressed with my date's choice. \n\nThis restaurant is old/classic and upscale. Very mature, prim and proper, and somewhat elitist. However, I have to agree with the review below stating that there were a lot of old folks present. At 24, we were the youngest couple in the building. Most of the patrons had gray hair, but that wasn't a problem. :) \n\nThe food was good, but not worth the hefty $200+ bill. The service was satisfactory, as the wait staff was attentive and helpful. \n\nNice restaurant, but I probably won't visit again... at least not anytime soon."
3,Thank you for making a beautiful ring! Sylvia was wonderful to work with and we love the finished product.
1,"ZERO complaints over 15 years and dozens of locations across the US. Was looking for that southern comfort warm and fuzzy feeling.\n\nBUT IT WAS NOT HERE\n\nAfter the first waitress was unfamiliar with the new menu items (not too terrible)... another person brought the food out and slammed down every item onto the table, and to the wrong person despite my reaction and attempt to move them over to my girlfriend... lucky guess she got the childs order to the right spot. Then got attitude like we had done something wrong like switched seats or something.\n\nDid not get all items out at once, which made my plate look stupid because it was only half full. In addition to giving the wrong plates out, since it was a different person we didn't get the requested ranch dressing until prompted with an attitude 'do ya need anything else?'\n\nThe ranch was brought out by the initial waitress and the check dropped off... kinda early? And we were never spoken to again! We sucked all first round drinks dry, left food on the table... especially our 4 year olds uncooked pink hamburger which had 0% chance of being rectified because we no longer existed to anyone.\n\nAND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE NEVER TIPPED.\n\nI've always left SOMETHING to at least reflect the performance of someone on the staff, but I have nothing good to say about this visit. The cashier asked how everything was, but was clearly unequipped to handle a negative reaction. I didn't spill the whole scoop, merely shared my disappointment to no empathy or effort to make resolution. So I paid cash and took my change, leaving nothing and heading straight for the exit.\n\nI feel bad for how a couple people representing an entire nation wide chain can impact a faithful customer in such a way, and the reaction they forced out of me to leave no $$. Sadly it's true that bad service can ruin everything, the food didn't taste right, there was no warm fuzzy comforting feeling, and I looked at and bought nothing in the shop out front. Sad day, it was a very sad day but due to a great record in the past I can't hit the 1 star. \n\nBetter luck next time CB but it will probably be a long time because I dont want to risk another awful experience when Im looking for something that should feel familiar."
0,"This barbershop is horrible they say they close at 9pm it was 7:43pm when I walked in and they said they're closed 2 barbers were there and said \""I'm done\"" bad business don't come here. Piece of shit ass business. They were rude."
3,I really wish Jimmy Johns would open some locations in Los Angeles.  It is a great lunch option.  The sandwiches are flavorful and filling.  The bread is quality and the toppings are fresh.  The staff at this location was friendly and quick.
4,"So, this is my first review, and I've already got writer's block.  Im sitting here trying to think of witty and insightful things to say, but all I can come up with is \""This place is super freakin good.\""  I live right around the corner, so my favorite part is the short drunk stumble I can embark on from my crib or Bikini Lounge, which I also spend an unreasonable amount of time at. (Bikini review almost certain to follow).  Since proximity is crucial to my lazy ass, no points deducted yet.  The second obstacle became apparent the first time I walked in, rockin a Cleveland Cavs shirt, which the owner who's from Detroit immediately began to hate on.  You see Cleveland and Detroit are in a constant heated battle for America's most ridiculed city, and we take it very seriously.  After a quick shit talking show, I realized how nice of a guy he actually was, and decided that I liked a little civic-pride in my food-obtaining.  It's a small joint, so there's usually two-max-three people in there and they make you feel like you walked in to their own homes for a nice meal.  Friendly, personable, and happy to see you.  Still at 5 stars.  \n\nFood: Pizza, sandwiches, salads, very basic.\n\nDelicious.  All of it.  I've had pretty much everything available, and it's all tasted outstanding.  Not often do you walk in to a small pizza/sandwich shop in a random neighborhood and get a quality Fish n Chips for like 6 bucks.  The pizzas are unique and interesting, and almost all have toppings you wouldn't immediately think to combine on a pie.  You'll learn that I'm extremely easy to please when it comes to basic foods, but the taste and portions at Valley Pizza always make me walk back over there and give them a high five (or low five or fist bump or whatever you're currently into).  \n\nAll in all, I've been to Valley Pizza about 15 times now, and I've never been dissatisfied.  I know giving something 5 stars on your first review sets a difficult precedent, but this is truly a hidden gem in a neighborhood known mostly for Bikini Lounge and the Grand Ave galleries.  (Also for the occasional bum fight in the parking lot across from Bikini which if I could review I would give ten stars).  Do yourself a favor and the next time youre in the mood for a pizza or a big-ass sandwich, give this place a shot.  And if you dont agree, I'm right around the corner and you can come tell me why.  I might jack you in the face, but my door's always open."
2,"For the price you pay, you're better off at cheaper hotels instead. This place is overrated by far. I spent one night at their Deluxe room back in 2006 and it felt like a $99 Marriott. It's basically your typical hotel called Bellagio. \n\nSeriously though, nothing unusual. Same customer service like every other hotels except here, the bathroom is a bit larger in comparison with other hotels."
3,One of my favorites in Las Vegas.  Great steaks and good atmosphere.  Good presentation and reasonably priced for Las Vegas restaurant.  Like the semi casual atomshere and only reason not 5 Stars cause it's a ways to get there at the MGM GRAND.  Maybe if you take the TRAM instead of taxi it would be better.
3,"Green curry with shrimp and chicken was delicious. Good portion with perfectly prepared rice. Will return to go for the Basil Duck. Quaint, quiet, tasteful. Perfect service."
0,Came to this nail saloon the other day for a full set of white tips. When I first got here the ladies were real kind and caring and a movie was playing. Throughout the process I noticed they didn't do things like the other places I have been to. About an hour later I was all done and felt satisfied with the job. While a couple hours later my nails were snagging on everything I touched. Then two days later my nails all cracked on the sides forcing me to cut and file the nails down. Needless to say this was the worst full set I have ever had done. I will never be back to this place.
0,"WHAT A SCAM!!!\nSaw the weekly albertso s ad that listed \""rib roast\""4.97 lb.\nBut when i went there i was suprised to find that you have to buy 20 LBS TO GET THAT PRICE!\nI was not alone there were other shoppers demanding to see the manager.\nI WILL NEVER SHOP ALBERTSONS AGAIN!"
3,"I had the pleasure of dining at Bouchon last week for the first time.  Will I go back?  Certainly.  My beet salad was wonderfully refreshing, the moules frites excellent, and creme brulee great (can you really f-up creme brulee?  I hope not).\n\nMy husband had the french onion soup and blood sausage.  Both were exceptional. \n\nThe service is top-notch and we will certainly be back again next year.  I didn't quite have same the earth-shattering experience that Tony Bourdain had over the frites- they were good, but got a little soggy as the meal wore on...  However, I was quite pleased that I finally found a restaurant on the strip that could make a gin fizz.  Bouchon is worth the stinky walk through Venetian for a great meal."
3,"The entire experience at Le Cirque was exceptional. There was no limit to the army of waiters attending to your every request. The menu was thoroughly explained. The decor was vibrate and colorful, good circus feel. We were a party of 5 celebrating our friend's graduation.\n\nThe food was as expected from a classy french restaurant. You will not be disappointed. The Foie Gras Saute was delicious as it slowly melted in the mouth. The \""assorted seafood\"" entree was typical, nothing too special. However, the desserts were something else. The presentation was spectacular (Had the strawberry sorbet contained in an iceball) and tasted just a little sweet, but you'll still enjoy it because you are in Vegas. \n\nOverall, everyone in the party agreed that the experience was great, the food was well presented and prepared. Everything will meet your expectations from this swell french restaurant."
3,I have been to this place in the past before they remodeled.  I enjoyed it.  I like the fact they brew their own beer on site.  You can tour the facility when there is time.  They are introducing new menu items and I was able to preview the new items.  I really enjoyed them. I will definitely have to go back.
3,"Staying open 24 hours on the weekend is an amazing idea from Pink Box. After a night out with friends, grabbing a dozen doughnuts seemed like the right thing to do. The only gripe I have would be the fact that they do not put out the apple fritters until 6am. Otherwise, the product and the service is fantastic. \n\nMajestic Megg working the counter definitely has more energy than anyone I have ever seen. I was falling asleep at 3am, but in her presence I was wired.\n\nThe goods themselves are definitely top notch. The Baple Macon (As Majestic Megg) referred to them were some of the best I have had. The maple glaze had a thin exterior coat and then a gooey center. The fruity pebbles one was also delicious. There is no way to keep the cereal crunchy, but the flavor was good. The cake doughnut with lemon glaze compliments the topping well. The biggest disappointment I had was with the strawberry shortcake. It was just a few pieces of fruit with a whipped cream dollop. It could have used some Bavarian cream or custard."

4,"Money doesn't grow on trees, but Dollar tree grows on saving.\n\nAlthough one may be embarrassed to go into a discount store, you'll miss out on some very cool items or only a dollar.  Things that you would normally buy at Walmart or Target, you can get it here for a fraction of the price.  In this economy, quality dollar items are hard to find, but at least here you'll find something that may surprise you and stretch out your budget.  \n\nStaff are friendly and place is clean. Also the company seems to do a lot of community projects as well which is pleasantly surprising for a discount store."
3,Atmosphere? Awesome! Drinks? They will knock your socks off. Micah has won mixologist of the year for good reason! He does not disappoint. Crispy pig ears were amazing. We also ordered the truffle popcorn; it wasn't awesome. Maybe the popcorn was stale? I'm not sure; had I not ordered it this review would be 5 stars. I really fell in love with this place. My experience was great! I'll be back soon!
4,"OMG! I finally got to eat here the other night and i was BLOWWWWWN AWAY! on how amazing this food was! It was INCREDIBLE! the burgers are ridiculously good, the fries are amazing, the staff is great the prices are great! ya definitely CANNNNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PLACE!"
2,"I don't understand why the lunch and dinner here are so different.  Is there a different owner for each meal?  \n\nLunch is self-service, no-frills sandwiches and soups.  In a word: plain.  \n\nDinner is table service and can be good.  But they emphasize a gimmicky fondue service and the main dishes can be hit-and-miss.  The pizzas are solid.  Meat can be over or undercooked.  Order seafood... watch out!\n\nWhy is it called the \""Bread Company\""?  They do appear to make their own bread, but it isn't that good.  Seems misleading.  Kind of like their \""specials\"" list.  (It doesn't change.)"
4,Grew up with Rita's and this place is one of the best I've been to! The owners and staff are genuinely welcoming and there's nothing better than a refreshing gelati on a hot day! Thank you Rita's of Surprise! :)
3,"Yum. In town for a conference and this place was close to convention center and open. Menu looked fantastics and the smell amazing.\n\nIt was an akward set up with some outside seating and a small bar with a few formal tables set in the front, kinda like a fish bowl. The remainder of the restaurant was around this wall. We did not get to sit there and there was still tables open. Only reason I didnt give this place 5 stars.\n\nI ordered the pepper crusted filet minion with spinach and garlic mash potatoes.  Just as a expected, it was excellent! Great portion, very well cooked, nice presentation and incredible taste. We even got a delightful bread with an herb butter for starters. \n\nService was pretty quick considering our meal choices and friendly. I would definitely recomend this place, especially if your attending a convention. Its one of few places open at night close to convention center and Westin."

0,"My family whent to have dinner at this location because is the only one close to our home ...i wish there was another option any ways.., i order togo one of the staff her name Dayssi she looks like a 15yr. old.. Don't know how to serve i ask is she could put more rice she looked at me funny ., I guess she was not happy about me asking, I'm going to pay for it don't want it for free!  2 week later i come back again with my family to have dinner about 7pm as soon as i walked in she started Laughlin at me whispering to another co worker. Her customer service sucks i felt discriminated  i talk to one of the girls that was in charge let her know how was i feeling .\n\n, I'm also calling the manager and and corp i don't want any for free i just want respect and good customer service !"
0,"Definitely don't go late at night. I've been there twice after 9pm and the staff is horrible. I ordered my smoothie without any added sugar but they made it so sweet I couldn't drink it. I asked it to be remade and again they added sugar. I don't understand...aren't smoothies supposed to be healthy? As I was sitting at the tables outside, some of their staff came out and sat at the next table smoking cigarettes. This is definitely not a good place to go to after a workout at the gym, especially if you're health conscious. I wish there was a Jamba Juice nearby that is open late."
2,"Third time lucky as they say to try something new. But is it worth the wait, to get a table and a cuppa in such a popular place on a Saturday with larger chains all around, I hear you ask? You know I wondered that myself as climbed the steps to enjoying hot food and drinks.\n\nAdequate and very comfortable seats with a large window to people watch from, and respite from window shopping on a crisp winters day on George Street. Or connect via the free wifi, as mentioned on the sign at the entrance.\n\nWith candle on table, (supplied as it day turns to dusk) flickering slightly in the breeze of lots of people coming and going, I was ready to indulge in the offerings that Fredericks has. \n\n10 mins in the door, was by now toasted like the fruit loaf I'd ordered very warm infact quite hot as I sat by the radiator but not quite as leg melting like a real fire might give you, although did feel like turning it down!\n\nIn all for this brief shop stop; dam fine coffee, coupled with fruit loaf made the wait all the better, but don't let the blue room colours put you off this place, cause it's red hot right now, or maybe that's my leg catching fire?"
0,"Did not answer the phone on multiple attempts. They say they're open on Sundays from 11:30am to 9:30pm, am I missing something? Horrible customer service."
1,"Imagine if there was a place in Britain called \""Quebec Poutine\"" that had grated mozzarella and sweet potatoes for the fries. Any Quebecor visiting the place would rightly be saying \""WTF?\"" to each other. En Francais, of course.\n\nSo as a Brit, I'm a little annoyed with the name because the food isn't like back home at all.\n\n\nFirst off the chips are done massively wrong. They are almost the over/double fried poutine style ones you get at something like La Banquise but slightly thicker.\nNow I don't know if they aren't using the right potato (I think this is probably true) or the oil is too hot but whatever, they aren't great. Mediocre.\nThey need Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes, or if they can't get them then something closer to fluffy/floury than they currently use. Soak them before they get fried.\nWhen done they should be closer to yellow than dark brown.\n\n\nThe fish is a very small piece and the batter is overcooked. The batter should again not be dark brown (even if you've put maple syrup in it, wtf?) it should be crisp and almost a casing for the fish to steam in, not a thin covering that barely protects it....without this the fish will lose its moisture and overcook....which has been the same for me each time I've been here.\n\n\nThe worst offender...the mushy peas. What the hell are you doing?!?! Honestly you'd be better off buying in tins of Batchelors ready cooked ones and reheating them.\nThese are ridiculously easy to make. Boil MARROWFAT peas in water, with some salt and some bicarbonate of soda until it is actually mushy and the peas are almost mashed potato consitency. Job done.\nThe ones they make...I think they take frozen garden peas, add mint and then put them through a food processor. They are an abomination.\n\n\nOn the upside I've been told the pies are nice and they sell Irn Bru so they get some points at least. I tried the Fried Halloumi and the Mars bar too, quite good.\n\nSort it out!!!"
1,"Yeah, no thanks.  Came here on a Thursday night to price out 4 tires and make an appointment to have them done.  They didn't have the tires in stock but had to order them and said they'd be here the next day, which was fine, so I set up an appointment for Sunday morning to have them done at 9am.  Sunday morning arrives and I'm there at 8:50am, waited for them to open and they took the walk-ins ahead of me (fine by me, I'm not that guy who stands at the door waiting for them to open staring at my watch the whole time, so I waited in my car- I had an appointment after all) when they finally get to me, they tell me it will be ready later that afternoon, I asked how long does it take to do tires and they looked through a pile of paperwork (including the walk-in's ahead of me) and preceded to tell me that they don't have the tires there and have to get them from the Tropicana store to which I told him that I already ordered them on Thursday and they should have had them in stock now, he just kinda said \""I'll have to look around for them\"".  I'm suddenly feeling like Jerry Seinfeld in that episode where he had a reservation for a rental car but on the day to get it, they didn't have one for him and he goes into his skit about not knowing the concept of a reservation, so I basically told him forget it, I'm going somewhere else as these people obviously don't know the concept of an appointment.  The stars are for the girl who set up the appointment (I believe her name was Jessica, very nice and knowledgeable).  Could have been a good review but the other people working that day (and possibly whoever was supposed to order the tires- don't know if they actually had them or not, and apparently neither did the guy working)  ruined that for Pep Boys.  I won't be returning."
3,I love this place I always go there when I'm really hungry and i'm in Laval around 10 pm.  The food is really good so are the drinks and there is a lot to choose from.  The cheesecake for dessert is amazing and theree's a lot of variety.  Only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 stars is that some of the waitresses give really poor service but other than that it's good place to go enjoy a meal and some drinks with friends or your loved one.
3,"Vegas lounges lack subtlety.  Rather than relying on a relaxed lounge atmosphere to bring in the customers, most lounges use loud boom boom music and Vegas strip club-style promotions.  But it's hard to lounge when you can't hear a word anyone is saying. \n\nVanguard is cut from a different cloth (at least on non-Fri and Sat nights--see below).  Unlike most Vegas spots, Vanguard understands that a good lounge (and a good mixed drink for that matter) has a subtlety and the ambiance should match.  Candles, brushed metal tables, and white walls decorate the Vanguard with a few pieces of eclectic art to match.\n\nThe bar is well-stocked with a variety of alcohols and subtle flavors.  The mixed drinks are tasty, tart and well-blended.  And the bartenders are friendly and helpful guides to nudge you in the right direction.\n\n4 stars for being a great bar on most nights.  \n2 stars on Friday and Saturday night when this place becomes yet another generic electronic club -- BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM [and you will want to leave after 5 minutes]"
0,Wow no spots on street. Must park in garage. Such full. Very paradox. No parking available. Definitely not wow. Must avoid. Stay away from towne.
1,Not impressed.  I ate here with my coworkers and we all ordered a variety of dishes.  I'll go over the issues with the restaurant first: the broccolini was overly oiled and very soggy.  The pizza was $25 and was a personal pan that tasted no better than the cheap pizza place down the hall.  We ordered the scallops and they came out RAW! I would not recommend this place. Too pricy for the low quality of food.
4,"Quality of food and service was excellent.  We didn't have a reservation but the manager was very accommodating. Service was second to none.\n\nWe had the trio of fish which was like something off master chef. We also had the trout which was really well cooked, full of flavor. Desert was amazing. We had the pineapple turnover and the chocolate fondant. Presentation of all the food was beautiful.\n\nWe had a really good night and the price was also reasonable for the quality."
1,"I used to love this store! It was such a fun find when I was a Pitt student. There were so many items spread between two rooms in the store - various articles of clothing to stuffed animals to stationary to silly cute gag toys...and so much more. I had a blast just wandering around exploring everything.\n\nNowadays half of the store selection is gone. You can barely even fit in here anymore because after eliminating half of their space (not exactly sure when or why this happened) they crammed as much stuff as they could into what little space was left. I hate walking in here now; it always feels like I'm going to knock every single thing in the store onto the ground. Not to mention, nothing in here even appeals to me anymore. It's all such generic stuff - for example, my old favorite, the stuffed toys that represent various germs or microbes, are long gone. Everything I can find here now is just...average cuteness. Nothing spectacular, nothing that I can't find online.\n\nI don't think this store is awful and I know some people will definitely like it, but I personally miss the old Kawaii Gifts and I'll always remember the old stock fondly. Maybe one day the current version can return to its glory days. Until then it's just not for me."
3,"Can't believe I've lived in the Valley almost 10 years before my 1st visit to Filiberto's.  I've tried several things on the menu, but this is the bottom line - the places are SPOTLESS.  The food is cheap and real and good.  I'm partial to a tostada when I'm in a hurry.  I'll get an enchilada plate if I'm in the mood to sit down.  Both fill me up.  The salsa bar is always a nice touch, although I don't think their salsa is the best.  Quality fast food and a good price."
4,"Our students love this restaurant!  When they come for Reiki, Reflexology and other classes, they love going for lunch at Las Glorias.  The salads with grilled chicken breast are delicious and a little of the bean dip completes an \""out of this world\"" lunch...just perfect for an afternoon of energy healing.  Thank you for taking such good care of us! Marsha Craven & Mary Ellen Brown of Healing Arts Connection."
1,"I have eaten at this restaurant three times, and I've had drastically different experiences each time. The first time I ate here, I had the bone marrow (which was actually delicious) and an Indian dish (I have since forgotten the name of it), which has actually been taken off the menu and rightfully so because it tasted like creole and a mockery to Indian cuisine. The second time I came here, I had the pleasure of eating very tasty mussels with a milk stout. My second experience was actually very pleasant, and I do hope to repeat it if I come back. \n\nWhen I came here my third time, I was met with a rude hostess and a bad brunch. As someone who used to be one, I understand that hosting at a restaurant on a weekend can be demanding and difficult. However, the hostess at this restaurant was not busy but also incompetent and rude. When we arrived, she told us that we would have to wait fifteen minutes. Not only did we wait almost an hour, but she was very combative and unapologetic when I asked for a more accurate waiting time. I wasn't expecting an actual apology, but I was met with excuses and an attitude. As said in my bio, I love eggs benedict, but this restaurant has further proven that I cannot find a delicious plate of eggs benedict in Madison; the egg was tough, and the yolk was dry. I find it almost a crime to cut into a benedict and not be met with a delicious, runny yolk. \n\nOverall, I'm impressed by the bone marrow and the mussels, but the brunch left me disappointed. If I come back, I hope I see a friendlier hostess whose attitude doesn't make me want to walk out."
2,"I'm pretty sure God is a garlic bagel. I'm not a fan of NY- it just doesn't work for me. But the food does. Def took advantage of the Jewish delis in San Fran: matzo ball soup, thick-ass pastrami sandwiches, and the obligatory bagels and lox... Mmm!\n\n2 ounce lox plate with a spinach and feta bagel and cheddar-garlic cream cheese: not a combo I'd normally opt for, but somehow it all really worked together- the fish was fresh and silky and plentiful, the bagel toasty and chewy, the schmear chunky with cheese and fragrant with garlic. Everything was plated beautifully too, a leaf of lettuce under all of the thick slices of tomato and red onion, a russian pickle, several slices of cucumber, and a handful of olives, too.\n\nI peeked in the pastry case \""just for a look\""- and walked out with a \""small\"" black and white, that was easily the size of my hand. I took a bite of the middle part with both frostings and fell a little bit deeper in love with food. Sadly, I knew I was also WAY over my calories for the day, so I only allowed myself half the treat.\n\nOnly think I didn't dig here was that the lox plate came with olives instead of capers, which I were told was an extra $2- which is downright absurd. I can buy a whole jar for that price. Not sure whose idea this was or why, but would appreciate that minor substitution next time- I don't eat olives at all.\n\nETA:\nPizza bagels (particularly the fresh spinach and feta) are divine, especially on the garlic bagel; matzo ball soup is better than the one offered at Weiss in Henderson; the tongue sandwich is also light and silky and delicious.\nBest quality deli in town, hands down."
1,"I'm generally not picky, but Merry-Ann's has become a disappointment for me.  You might say \""well, it's just diner food,\"" but even for that it's kinda expensive.  If you stick to biscuits and gravy you're pretty safe, and their fries and hash browns aren't bad.  However, everything is a couple bucks more than I would like to be paying for greasy diner food.\n\nI think the final straw with me was when I ordered a chicken tender plate only to receive chicken nuggets that definitely came out of the freezer: uniform inside texture, only vaguely reminiscent of chicken.  I'm pretty picky about mechanically separated chicken.  Maybe that's snooty, but I just hate it.  In any case, for how much I paid I expected something a little better than that.\n\nFor late night food, you're better off making it yourself or even going to Steak 'n Shake."
0,"Will not be coming back here, waste of time. The owner was very nice and welcoming but that didn't make up for the quality of service. Started with the deluxe pedicure for a decent price. The water was cold. When I go for a pedicure I mostly go for the massage, I usually pay for extra massage if needed. She was pretty much just putting lotion and the sea salt on my legs and feet. No massage or rubbing what so ever. I asked her if she could rub harder or more rough. She either didn't understand or did not want to because she just told me no and shook her head. Complete waste of time, I did not see a point since I can put lotion on my legs myself.. Also painted my toes poorly with excess polish on my skin. When it came to get my gels replaced I presented a design I just wanted something similar. He did well on the design yet painted very poorly missing the sides of my nails and the gel is not thick enough and bumpy. My nails can chip or break very easily. All in all I'm never going back there. I only came there because my usual place is closed Mondays. Tiffiany's Nails, they are great."
0,"Such a shame. This is the exact kind of restaurant Im always looking for. Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange... Then I had a seat, but Boone came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the \""order here\"" sign. I got up and asked, \""is this where I order?\"". They responded, \""wherever....\"". \n\n\nIt was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend $20+ on a lunch and drink- long story short. I just can't support a company with staff that are do co fused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.\n\nI've never seen a place run with such confused employees. I mean, who can't day whether its seat yourself or not? Who cannot say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter? \n\nRidiculous."
4,"With the addition of WiFi, this cafe now gets 5 stars. Great service, great food, cosy atmosphere, able to work from there too now."
4,"We went in for an early dinner on a cold and gloomy Saturday. We had reservations and were seated right away, the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were led to a long narrow table right next to a huge group. We rebelled and asked for a booth. The host staff pondered a bit and said well, we can give you a booth, but we will be needing it by 6:45. Yeah, right. We will hurry thru dinner to give your table back. Ha ha. Sure, I said. We took the booth. \n\nService was very attentive and warm and friendly. We both had salads. For dinner, B.J. selected the Lobster Mac N Cheese. We were both expecting very little evidence of lobster, but there was actually a good quantity. The pasta and the cheese sauce was very delicious. I love this dish! I opted for the Surf & Turf. They have since changed the menu, but my steak was a perfectly grilled filet mignon with a super yummy crab cake. \n\nFor dessert, we had the winter trio. It was a small portion of ginger cake and a huge creme brulee. Loved, loved, loved dessert. I love this restaurant."
4,"You've seen the Apple/PC commercial, right?  Well, I'm the PC guy.  Sure, I've used an Apple here and there, but I have never owned one.  I'm also not going to tell you that I suddenly walked in, found out how nice they are, and walked out with an armload of Apple equipment.\n\nI will tell you that the staff of the Apple Store is top-notch.  Even knowing that I'm a PC guy, and also knowing that the only reason that I was there (for three days in a row, no less) was to give the kids something to do for a few days during the summer - for free even, they were happy to do it, and they let me play with stuff the whole time.\n\nNow I didn't give up any passwords on the public computers, because I just don't do that.  But I could have.  Plenty of other parents did.  I could have sat there and used the free wi-fi all day.  But I didn't.  Instead I just watched in amazement as dozens lined up for a new iPhone, and dozens more came and went for their turn at the genius bar.  It's actually pretty amazing.  If I ever get an Apple, this will be why.\n\nIf you go in, say hi to D'Art and Noelle for me."
1,"Hmmmm...I know that I shouldn't expect too much when going to the mall, but basic sales and customer service skills are always nice.  Basically the store gets an extra star because they do have items that are unique to this Sanrio that can't be found at other Sanrio's---I was visiting for work and decided to stop by here to grab some goodies for the kiddies.  \n\nI was not greeted or acknowledged until I walked to the back of the store and started touching merchandise in the back.  I selected some items that were on sale with a certain percentage off.  I get to the register see that there is a sign stating that if I spend $30, I would receive a coupon for $15 back to use on my next purchase.  My total came out to $26---I proceeded to ask if I would be able to qualify for the coupon.  The cashier then proceeded to tell me it would not work on sales items---here was her chance to upsell me---she didn't take the chance.  \n\nI just said ok and paid for my purchases and walked out.  Had the cashier not been so preoccupied in trying to expense out products to create gift sets--she would have noticed that she rung up my order incorrectly.  Luckily I checked my receipt outside of the store---I would've been salty if I was on the plane headed home.  She forgot to ring up the sale items as such---so I go in to tell her that I need a refund for the incorrect amount.  She passes me off to someone else that had no idea what was going on.  The refund took a good 15 minutes and at the end of the transaction the cashier wanted to know if I still wanted the products---uh duh---I just want my 30% off that the sign surrounding the products says I should get.  Finally I get my corrected receipts and continue to stand there because after they took the products out of the bag---they were trying to go back to their busy work---after 10 seconds I finally just asked for the products so I could be on my way.\n\nI totally understand we have our slow days---but 2 people in the same store working at the same place being slow---no good can come of that.  But alas, this store does have interesting items that other ones don't, so next time I visit Vegas I will probably shop here again, but with a lot lower standards than I am accustomed to so I don't get grumpy."
2,Definitely a smaller home repair place but it's in the neighborhood and very convenient. They have just enough. Prices are pretty good too.
2,I have been going to Rise and Shine off and on since it opened and it continues to disappoint. Merely by virtue of being the only non-bar breakfast place in the area it lasts despite mediocre food and terrible service. I have yet to eat a meal there that was not lukewarm and the victim of bad execution.
1,"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  We did come in about half an hour before closing, so you know how service gets when the staff is ready to go home. They practically make you hurry up so they can go home.   \n\nBTW as one of the workers was trying to clean up around us while eating, you know to rush us out.  She rushed so quickly that she didn't realize that rthe end of her towel she was wiping the counters with also dipped into the dirty dish holder.  So what she wiped the counters with was dirty.  AND when we left, I found a piece of bread on the floor even after the workers made about 2-3 time sweeps around us, you know to rush us out (yes I said it again).  I bet it flew on the ground like how they were flying that dirty rag on the counter.  \n\nOn to food critiques.  I ordered the Manhattan Clam Chowder bowl and Fried Oysters for appetizer and seafood bouillabaisse for main dish.  Manhattan Clam Chowder wasn't tasty.  Large portion, but not tasty.  Fried Oyster was probably the best of what I ordered.  It was about a little less than a dozen pieces and the oyster pieces were large too.  When the main course came in, the waitress said it was a popular dish there.  I picked it because I always thought that workers at the restaurant knows what is best.  Yah, that wasn't for me.  To me, that dish was something that I could make at home.  \n\nI don't often come to GVR, but don't think I woudl come back to this Oyster Bar."
0,"I am sorely disappointed with this driving school. After reading the reviews that were all so positive,  I signed up my 16 year old daughter for three lessons. The first lesson I felt was somewhat productive as the instructor taught her how to parallel park, but the second and third lessons were a waste of money. All they did was drive around from what she explained to me and the instructor only took her on the freeway one time. When I would ask how she did, the reply from the instructor was \""She's a natural\"". I wish I could say I agree. I expected this school to teach her defensive driving, how to pull into a parking space, etc. On top of it, he had the radio playing while they were driving which I don't agree with when you have a young, inexperienced driver behind the wheel. She even told me after the third lesson that I wasted my money and that everything the instructor told her, she already knew or I could have told her! The only upside to this review is hopefully it will save me money on the car insurance. I would not recommend this school."

4,This is a phenomenal resort. It has everything anyone could be looking for. The service is exceptional. The food is excellent. The rooms are quite nice. It skid friendly and pet friendly. The fitness room is definitely above average for a hotel fitness room. I cannot recommend FireSky highly enough.
4,This location is now permanently closed.
3,"I don't know how this place only has an average of 2.5 stars!  Every time I've eaten here it's been great, to my surprise being that Fremont isn't well known for it's restaurants (at least not that side of Fremont.) Although Red Sushi is within a casino, the prices aren't nearly as expensive as anywhere on the strip and the quality and service has always been very good. The lucky roll is one of my favorites.  Definitely an underrated gem :)"
0,"My girlfriend and I went to Fathead's on a hot Thursday night therefore we had no desire to sit outside. Upon arrival we were told by the hostess that we would have to wait longer for a table inside (which was fine).  After about 30 minutes of waiting the hostess took us to a table outside. We told her we had requested to sit inside her response \""oh I should have written that down. You will have to wait another 30 minutes for a table inside\"". Even though we had just waited 30 minutes for a table INSIDE. After no apology from the hostess for her screw up, we decided that we were not going to wait longer to eat at a place with such a rude staff member. I don't care how great the craft beer selection is, a rude staff certainly is a deal breaker. We will definitely not be returning In the future."
3,"My coworker and I just left there. It was my first time trying this place and it was pretty good. I checked it out online before I went and people compared it to In N Out. To, me The Habit is better by far especially their fries. My burger was a little pink inside but not enough to make a fuss about.  The only drawback today was the landscapers. Seemed like everytime I started talking, he'd fire up the saw he was using lol.  Will definitely eat here again."
4,After moving into our home we were bombarded with pest control companies. Their prices were ridiculous and their sales tactics annoying. I called Hoppers and found great prices and service. They are a husband/wife team and are so pleasant and professional. I have had some odd things occur at my home and Hoppers have resolved each issue quickly and the first time. I really appreciate that I don't have to make call after call to fix a problem and they work around my schedule.
1,"If you go there, go for the Girls, wings and burgers.  The rest of the food is pretty marginal. My pet peeve there is they bring out the sauces in the little vacuum sealed cups that you get at Jack in the Box or McDonald's, (come on this is a restaurant cant they make fresh ranch)??? It is a sports bar to and drink beer and watch sports,chat up the waitresses and watch sports on one of the many TVs.... dont go there expecting much more ."
2,"This place had a nice vibe to it.  It was located in a nice area, and the atmosphere was nice.  The environment was nice and modern, but I'm not that much of a fan of it.  I really just liked the orange lamps.  \n\nI was not a big fan of the menu.  I really did not know what I was ordering.    I just did not get much details from the menu.  I did enjoy my  chili-capellini & lump crab though.  I thought it was delicious with  a little kick of spice."
4,"Amazing food! Great atmosphere! Tastes as authentic as it can get around here. I have been to nearly every Thai restaurant in the east valley and this is my number one spot!\n\nThere's a curry without coconut milk, very spicy! That's my favorite dish there. A medium tastes Thai hot! Highly recommend this place!"
2,"Very nice staff and clean restaurant. The wait time can be a little long sometimes. The food is hit or miss. It's either fresh and great or old and dry. Just depends on your timing. Prices have steadily been rising, but I guess that's to be expected in today's day and age."
4,"There is something exceedingly satisfying about having fine food prepared perfectly, and my dinner at Fig Tree satisfied existentially. To begin with, the service was unbelievable (quite possibly the best I've ever gotten). We went early and dragged our 15 month old along and they were able to accommodate us in a spot that didn't ruin anyone else's dining experience. The waiter was helpful and managed to convince us to order an appetizer special and the soup special (all of which were exceptional). The courses came out with perfect timing, were cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and sauced perfectly. All of the flavors were balanced perfectly, and nothing got lost or overwhelmed in spice. They have just started offering a tasting menu (if you call ahead) apparently, so it looks like we'll have to hire a sitter..."
3,"Been here on 3/22/14, the service was nice and there were good veg options too.. (As am vegie) liked the complimentary bread & onion. \n\nAnd there soup & oyster entree was awesome.. But keep in mind it bit pricey for what you get !!"
4,"Omg I just tried this place for the first time today and it was amazing! I only had a few small bites before coming to the conclusion that this is some great BBQ!! I am so glad I found this little treasure! I will most definitely be back again, again and again!!"
3,"In all of my trips to Las Vegas, I'd never been to Brand Steakhouse before - nor had I even been to the Monte Carlo for that matter.  But this restaurant came up with an incredible prix fixe menu for Yelp Spring Break, and my party of six was blown away with the quality of our meal.\n\nOur waiter and the rest of the staff were attentive, although, if I recall correctly, it may have taken a while to get the bill.  Other than that, recommendations were awesome, drinks were always refilled before they went empty, service was prompt, etc... and I really enjoyed the environment of this restaurant as well; just feet away from the casino floor, yet not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation.  Our booth was comfortable as well.\n\nMy group chose a bottle of Terrazas Malbec from their plentiful wine selection, although the cocktails looked awesome too.  And before our first course, we requested Brand's infamous cast-iron baked dinner rolls, which were doughy heaven!\n\nThe best part of the experience, aside from the company, were the courses that followed.  Be forewarned though: portions are huge!  I had a wedge salad to start, the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and I shared sides with Katie B: the creamed spinach and the asparagus.  Everything was delicious!  I think I was in a food coma half way through my entree, but I managed to almost polish off my Baked Alaska dessert as well!\n\nOthers in our group were also pleased with their selections: Filet Mignon, Chicken, Tuna Tartare, and more.  \n\nTime to start watching my diet again now that Yelp Spring Break is over, but I'm sure I'll be ready to dine at Brand again next visit to Vegas.  It was a memorable meal for sure and I highly recommend a visit if you find yourself on the hunt for a steakhouse in Vegas!"
3,I have been here twice. I love that feel of the place. My son thinks it is super cool to have people cook your food in front of you. I always get sushi and love it! It taste fresh and is super yummy. My kids and husband do not eat seafood at all so they get the chicken teriyaki. They love it and it is always such a HUGE portion. I absolutely love their food and friendly staff.
0,"Exorbitantly priced.  Some employee (a young guy) sitting in the back room on his cell phone the entire time we were in the 'showroom' and the only GOOD part of our experience with these guys was the woman who initially answered the phone and greeted us when we walked in.  She was very friendly however she unfortunately was only allowed to give us a rehearsed, insincere response to any question with, \""I don't know.  I can have our 'estimator' come out to your place and meet with you.\"""
1,If you are planning to go here due to the awesome experience you've had at the San Diego location then DON'T DO IT! it'll totally ruin your fond tasteful memories of this place. This location does not have the same stuff on the menu. No strawberry mimosa?! super weak! the presentation of the food was awful. The 5 hostesses were pretty unorganized. It started off on a bad note and definitely ended on a bad note.
4,"Everything from appetizer to desert has been amazing. I love veggie rolls, tom kay and  the curry noodles. The curry noodles I need at least once a month but if I could I would have it once a week, it's just that good."
3,"I am what some may consider a fro-yo connoisseur. This is one of my new favorites. The toppings are pretty standard but they have tasty and unique flavors. New favorites are Nilla Wafer, Kona Coffee Blend, and Key Lime Bars. YUMMM! It's never too crowded and is always clean and toppings are always well stocked. Yogurtland is definitely worth a try the next time you're looking for a cool treat!"
1,"I've been waiting for something like this to come to surprise and was real excited to take the family and friends there when it opened.  Went a few days before the actual grand opening and had a good time, but my mood instantly changed when I went out to get something in my truck and came inside to a \""bouncer\"" telling me they were at capacity.  When i told him i had family in there he made me seem like a liar, and he wanted me to call my girlfriend to come to the front just so I could go back in, not a good way to start your business.  \n\nSo I thought what the heck lets try it again another weekend, so last weekend I went with some other family to show them how nice it was, I mean they have TV's everywhere an awesome arcade, and even have a 21 and older section for after 8pm that has its own lanes, bar, pool table and DJ booth for the weekends, and it doesn't cost any extra which is kind of cool.  First thing when we walked through the door was another \""bouncer\"" telling me they were at capacity and they had a 2 hour wait, when clearly i could see from the door there was open seating EVERYWHERE and there were many open lanes.  After about 15 mins of waiting in line I asked the lady if I could use the restroom, she told me I could go next door to the movie theatre and use there's because she didn't trust me that I would come back from theirs.  AWESOME SERVICE!!! (sarcastically speaking)! \n\nI would give this place more stars but the service and people are terrible!! The food was good and bowling was a little overpriced but your paying for luxury pretty much.  \n\nIf they wanna stay in business they need to work on their customer service...ALOT... maybe start by getting rid of the stupid \""were at capacity\"" thing when your not even close to it! \n\nI'll probably wait a while before I go back"

1,Used to come here all the time but they got rid of their best sushi chef Steve. Now many of the rolls have cream cheese? What kind of sushi is that? Oscar is a great teppan Yaki chef and Mimi is very nice but the sushi has lost its luster in the last 2 years.
4,"So we decided to give Sammy's another shot after being invited back by the GM. SO glad we did!! The service was much improved this time around, we saw much more of our server, Alex, than we did of our server during our last visit. We had the dumplings (finally!) as well as their calamari, both of which were awesome. We also enjoyed their flourless chocolate cake. Some of the menu descriptions don't do this delicious food justice. We were thoroughly impressed not only by the display of exceptional management but also the fantastic server we had who not only made suggestions but also ensured our glasses were never empty and our plates didn't sit for too long. I hope this was not a fluke and I truly hope that Sammy's is striving to improve their customer service. As for us, we will certainly be back and recommend to friends in the GV area. I hope next time around the service and food are just as consistent. Thank you Sammy's staff for restoring my faith in the customer service industry!!"

0,"Due to the theme/gimmick of the Nitty, it's one of those places that as a student/downtown resident, you'll inevitably end up here at least once for a birthday bash. And everytime that i'm invited to a get together here, I get a sinking feeling, and moan outloud to myself, knowing that i'm going to have a not so great night planned. My main 2 problems with the Nitty are the two things I go out for: Good food, and a pleasant atmosphere. SPOILER: They're lacking in both.\n\nConcerning the food: I didn't find any of their appetizers particularly memorable anytime I went there. So, they weren't bad, but not anything I can't have done better at other places. When I had their burgers a few years ago, I had a similar sentiment about them. They aren't bad, but i'd rather have a burger at the Old Fashioned or even The Plaza. But, in the last couple years, I became a vegetarian, and luckily for me (or so I thought), the Nitty has veggie burgers! But, there's one problem with that: The veggie patties there suck. Like really bad. Like so bad that I only ate three bites of the burger I ordered before putting it down for good. And they have the nerve to charge more for them too. Good veggie patties definitely exist (See: DLUX, The Echo Tap, The Harmony Bar), so i'd recommend that the chefs here take some notes from those restaurant's books. Just the fact that a place would serve something so awful takes their entire menu down a couple notches.\n\nConcerning the atmosphere: It's just too tacky and in your face for me to tolerate. All over the walls are pictures of people who celebrated birthdays at the Nitty ( I even saw one of my friends when he was like 2!). Like I know it's their theme, but it's still pretty corny. If you dare step out of the dining room, and into the bar, then you're in for a real nightmare. It takes forever to get a drink, and the music they play is so deafeningly loud and horrible (Tangent: I know music taste is subjective, but their playlist really rubs me the wrong way, because I hate hate HATE hair metal with every fiber of my being, and i'm pretty sure the selector here isn't aware that music after the year 1995 exists), that you literally have to scream at the top of your lungs just to have the bartender or anyone you want to have a conversation with hear you. I'm not even exaggerating about how loud it is; Like i'm legit concerned that they're committing OSHA violations for forcing employees to work in a setting where they'll lose their hearing. It's even worse during \""Power Hour\"" (10-11 PM), where a plethora of bottom tier liquors and piss waters (or \""domestics\"" as some call it) are ultra cheap. Avoid being there at that time at all costs.\n\nOn second thought, just avoid going here regardless of the time of day. You might be able to squeak by a tolerable experience due to the menu having some decent items and most of the wait/bar staff being nice, but more often than not, you'll have wished that you went somewhere else for your bash."
0,"Dined at Oregano's last night and had the most horrendous service in my life.  When inquiring about the wait for our pizza the female bartender barked at us and said that sausage takes 30 minutes.  She continueed to be rude and argumentive to us and after requesting the manager (young lady) the bartender continued her rudeness.  The manager went to check on our pizza and said \""it's only been 26 minutes\"".  Well young lady, is that 26 minutes after the inept bartender put our order in the POS or was it 26 minutes after we ordered it.  Ever think about that?  Then the bartender's regulars had to pipe up and defend her rudeness.  My money will spend the same at any of the numerous choices aroung PV Mall, but won't be doled out at this place anymore.  For a place that wants to be \""your neighborhood joint\"", their hospitality is lacking."
3,Wonderful sushi and creative desserts to top it off! Sleek and cool ambiance with service that isn't rushed. You may want to give yourself extra time though if you're seeing a show after dinner or are on a tight schedule.\n\nThis is a nice spot for sushi and more. There were some pretty unique dishes...a sea bass with black truffle oil for appetizer was really good. The sea bass was so tender and yummy. There was a caulifower with some very light breading that was very good too.\n\nFor sushi - the fish seemed really fresh and melted in your mouth. We didn't try the really unusual rolls though - they had some pricey ones.\n\nWhat I remember was the dessert. The green tea mousse was light and airy topped with matcha powder. The apple fritter with dulce de leche ice cream was very good too. They have a chocolate souffle on the menu too but we were running late so we did not try it.\n\nThey also had a variety of sake and cocktails so there's something for everyone here whether you like sushi or not.
2,"MLML always is looking for a good burger and we heard about Bachi Burger from a co-worker.\nBachi Burger is hidden in a small strip mall and has a touch of an Asian atmosphere.\nWe ordered the Bachi pickles for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised of the presentation.  Two small oblong trays of different items - cauliflower, beet, cucumber, and other  assorted veggies but the best was the garlic.  It was soaked in some teriyaki sauce or Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce and it tasted sweet not like a garlic at all.  I could have eaten a whole plateful of those.\nMLML ordered the Kiki burger which he devoured and i ordered the steamed duck sandwich or a version of the hum bao or manapua.  We were both very satisfied with our meals and the specialty dessert.\nThe service could have been better - they forgot a salad and seldom filled our drinks.\nThat was the first time we were there...\nI had to bring down the rating to 3 starts because the second time we were there, MLML ordered a burger with blue cheese which was not tasteful at all and I switched to the steam sandwich with the pork belly.  The pork belly had too much fat in it and I had to separate it.  Service was so-so.  Pickles were still great!\nI would go back to try the last steam sandwich option with the short rib."
4,"My favorite characteristic of Troy and his Crew is his terrific customer service!  He will always make time for me, even on the busiest of days, and if he can't actually stop, he will let me know that.  THAT, in itself, is HUGE.  His communication, to ensure that he is setting the appropriate expectations, is unmatched.  Moreover, he has often offered to help me fix something via phone...how f'ing remarkable is that!?  I would highly recommend Troy and his services to all my family and friends!"
4,My wife works across the street at the Sunrise Hospital.  Any time we meet for lunch we always choose Applebee's.   The service is friendly and quick especially if you sit in the bar.  The 2 for 20 is our go to choice for a cheap lunch.  We have yet to be disappointed.
3,"What a delightful find!  Stopped by for a quick bite; had the falafel pita which was very good, made to order and fresh. I was given a sample of their spicy dip and chips; quite tasty. And the best baklava (with nutella) that I ever had in my life...this sweet melt in your mouth experience was wonderful. Worth going back to !!"
2,"Having gone here only once so far, I did what I usually do at a new bakery: I get one of almost everything. I don't remember everything I got, but I will say what is still floating around in this goldfish brain of mine.\n\nThey had pecan and chocolate chip cookies they said were good sellers. I can see why. They weren't super moist, but they were pretty tasty. The \""apple turnover\"" was exactly what you'd expect. They had these little sponge-cake-filled-with-custard-bites which were not revolutionary but still fun to eat. A pretty apricot cookie had subtle but satisfying fruitiness mixed with a crunchy French cookie exterior. The chocolate croissant was... a decent chocolate croissant! The baguette had that satisfying artisan/\""authentic\"" look to it: hard exterior, particular cuts in the dough to make it rise a certain way, and give it that \""I want to eat it\"" look.\n\nAs for their sandwiches - just don't. You're buying about $7-8 worth of bread with a dismal amount of ingredients inside. Just don't. Go next door to Paymon's if you're hungry.\n\nAlthough, not the absolute best, but definitely a step above most bakeries - and that is refreshing. They seem to really be trying. One detail that really stood out about the pastries was that none were too sweet - at all! Huge points for this. I'll definitely be back here to give a more thorough review as they develop more as well."
4,"Everything was outstanding with our visit to Border Grill.  Read about this in Vegas magazine and was so happy we decided to go here.  My girlfriend was really looking for a good meal with lots of flavor and this didn't disappoint.  We walked from the Wynn to Mandalay Bay to take in Las Vegas on our last night, so definitely worked up an appetite.  The margaritas were very clean and crisp with a hint of spice and paired great with the ceviche sampler that we started with.   After we demolished the delicious starter, we moved on to entrees - she had the Chicken Mole Verde and I went with the Yucatan Pork.  Both were incredibly filling and so very flavorful.  The Chicken was succulent and the pork was just delicious.  We had eaten enough that we didn't dare eat dessert and ended up taking some of our entrees home with us.  The wait staff topped off the experience by being involved, friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend and plan to go there again when in Vegas."
4,May I recommend the Kahuna Burger? I'm a huge fan of Pulp Fiction and I always wanted to try a kahuna burger so I was pretty excited to find a place that makes them. I don't think they are modeled after the film but the burger is delicious. I also recommend the rumbi fries!
0,"Used to be great, however, they changed the menu and now it is horrible.  We ate dinner there shortly after they changed and it was awful so we decided to give them time to get themselves together as we figured it must be due to the transition.  Wrong!  Have eaten there twice since and still horrible.  We won't be back."
3,Great pimento cheese grits and brunch in general!  Only con was they served pancake syrup instead of maple syrup. \n\nOverall it was great and we will be back.
1,From a 1 being horrible and a 5 being awesome:\n\nFood - 2\nService - 4\nAtmosphere - 2\nPrice - 1\n\nThe food here was pretty bad and paying 3x what it was worth made it taste a lot worse.
3,"BJ's is a chain, but as far as chains go, they are better than most.  They have a huge menu, and I've never had a bad meal.  My favorites are the flat bread pizzas, bread bowl soups, and the sandwiches.  \n\nThe large selection continues with the beer, including a BJ's \""brand\"".  I'm not sure where they are brewed, but it is not on the premises.  Some are better than others, and I prefer the Nutty Brewnette and the porter.\n\nI've never had a real problem with the service, but with any chain it can be hit or miss.  Also, they are often very busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights, and you may experience slightly slower service due to the volume of patrons.  To avoid the wait time to be seated, you can call ahead and they will put your name on the seating list.\n\nThe happy hour is excellent, 3-7 on weekdays, cheap-er appetizers that are all pretty solid, and discounted BJ's beer.  The only problem is that you have to sit in the bar area, which can fill up quickly.\n\nThe take out service is very good, which is a plus since the restaurant can be so busy.  Little touches go a long way such as keeping warm food warm, not adding fries to the order until you arrive, and keeping the soup in a separate container from the bread bowl so you can combine them when you are ready to eat.  They also go over your entire order to ensure that it is exactly what you asked for."
2,"Just like most Mcdonalds, opened 24/7 and free wi-fi. Nothing particularly special about this one. Recently renovated. It is quite dirty late at night though. Most of the tables are really messy so you end up spending 5 minutes trying to decide which one is the least messy to sit and eat."
4,"These guys are awesome!! Always help me out when I need it and extremely friendly. Big shout out to Gabriel, worked wonders for me even on his first day. Thank you!"
1,"Terrible!  Turkey sandwich with hardly any turkey. Nice place but what a rip off!  Even the free yogurt was lousy. Ok, the chips were OK. First time and the last too."
2,"We came down to the buffet since it was the closest place to get some breakfast food on a Sunday morning. It was pretty good for taking the elevator down and have a choice of just about any kind of food you want. I don't think you can expect lobster and crab at 11:00am in the morning, but you will get some things like prime rib and other nice cuts of meat. \n\nIf you're not gambling then you're probably going to pay full price at like $25 or more. Coming from Chicago this is a pretty steep price. You're only in Vegas so much, so why not right? I would probably go back here again if I could eat twice as much or if I had a huge amount of comps. If you got money to blow, you're really hungry and don't want to go far from the hotel, then you can get away with eating here and being happy about it."
0,"This used to be my go to place for fish. Yes, they are a little pricey but they used to have super knowledgable staff. Not anymore. The last couple times I've been in I have been extremely disappointed with the staffs lack of ability to answer the \""more advanced\"" questions I had. Also, the selection of fish isn't what it used to be. Fintastic used to have unique fish, now they have similar selection to everywhere else. I guess the unique fish went away the same time as the knowledgeable staff.  I also met their manager Larry. What an egotistical prick!  He was rude and demeaning, and appeared to have very little fish knowledge.  I don't know what the owners were thinking when they hired that guy!  I was on the fence about continuing to do business there but once I met the manager and saw his interactions with other customers, I was done."
4,"Wow, another five star review. This has been a good weekend for eating out. \n\nThis is a smallish strip mall restaurant. I seem to remember it being a Chinese carryout back in the old days. Now it is one of the best Thai restaurants in the Valley. \n\nWe had Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Lemon Chicken. All was just wonderful. We asked for it all the be cooked \""number five,\"" which is \""Thai Spicy.\"" Truly excellent, and actually spicy--not wimped down.\n\nThe little place is decorated with all sorts of interesting pictures, photos, statues and other odds and ends. The did a good job decorating what had been at one time a pretty plain store front--though I probably would not decorate my house similarly. \n\nService was some of the best I've experienced. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. He brought a little juice box for our toddler, which was a nice touch. After lunch the owner came out and talked with us for awhile. She told us that she grows a lot of the herbs and spices in her own garden. You can tell. She also asked us to let her know, personally, if things are ever subpar. She said that when they get busy she worries sometimes that someone will leave unhappy. After chatting with us for awhile she gave little Dan another juice box, so he also gives the place five stars.\n\nI really hope people support this little gem. I wish we had more places like it. Outstanding."
2,"This place is solid but nothing special.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Bar Louie is the physical space which is quite modern and clean in its appearance. Views of the water and city are also fantastic.\n\nNow for the actual food: upscale bar food that is good, but nothing to write home about. My meal included nachos as an appetizer and Mac&Cheese for the entree.    Nachos were the standard gringo fare that is typical of nacho dishes in this part of the country: salty chips, bland salsa and blah guac.  The Mac and cheese, however, was heavenly.  \n\nService for our large group was on point.  The price was a bit too steep for my tastes given the quantity and quality of food I sampled.  Honestly, unless you're in Station Square or the immediate area, I wouldn't go here.  There are far better bars in Pittsburgh with more character and tastier food that I'd consider."
4,Everything I've ever had here was delicious.
0,"I would give Nathan zero stars if I could. \n\nMy vet recommended Innate Dog Training when my rescue Corgi puppy failed his second round of group puppy class at Petsmart. My dog was high-energy and territorial, which was a problem with food and toys since we were a two-dog household. He would routinely growl and snap at our other dog, and he had even bitten me as I reached for food or toward his bowls. \n\nMy initial consultation with Nathan was great, and I opted to board my dog for training because of the aggression and biting. Nathan said training would be 10 days, but 10 days turned into two weeks, which eventually turned into three and a half weeks, before he felt my dog was ready to return home (and of course, more $$ for each day that went by). \n\nUpon his return, the dog was clearly obedient to Nathan, but once Nathan left, he was back to growling and snapping over food. Nathan met me once for an emergency session, and then he recommended that I come to group classes, but the dog's behavioral problems persisted. He attacked our other dog, shredding his ear, and things got so bad that we had to keep both dogs physically apart in separate rooms of the house. \n\nI called Nathan in desperation, and he told me that the dog's behavior problems stemmed from the fact that I am a woman. He told me, \""They don't call them man's best friend for no reason.\"" \n\nNot only did Nathan belittle me, disrespect me, and make generalizations about my ability to handle an animal due to my gender, but he also stopped returning my calls and emails. I left multiple voicemails, which he just disregarded entirely. I understand that his profession is training dogs, but to run a business, one must also work with the people who own the dogs. A lack of communication is entirely unacceptable. \n\nI paid thousands of dollars and trusted my pet to Nathan, and for what?\nIn the end, I made the heart wrenching decision to give my dog away to a rescue group in the hopes that he finds a better circumstance and a home where he can be the only pet. \n\nI am happy for the satisfied customers who have posted reviews, but if you are considering Innate Training - especially if you are a woman! - do yourself a favor and skip this bigoted, unprofessional business owner."
3,"This is the first time I've been here and it was a great experience! As you can see in the photo it is big, it actually set up in a warehouse.  It's a great place if there is inclimate weather or I it's late and you have no where to practice (it's open till 10).  So there are cages for baseball and softball; also there are cages to practice pitching, catching and just about anything that revolves around baseball and softball.  I would definitely recommend this place!"
2,"I tried to order a pizza for a family member who lives in Madison (I live in a different state) who just got out of the hospital. However, Papa Murphy's doesn't take payments over the phone and they don't have the option to order on their website (at least not on the mobile site).  This is pretty pathetic for a business in this modern-day. Please offer payment over the phone or on your website at the very least.\n\nI had to take my business elsewhere (in this case, Toppers, which was very accommodating, and no this isn't a paid ad for them, I just feel like they should get a pat-on-the-back for accommodating my order when Papa Murphy's couldn't).\n\nPapa Murphy's, please embrace technology - it's a great thing!"
4,"I've gone to manisha for about a year now and can trust she will always make me look great. I've gone to her before photoshoots, runways, and other modeling gigs. She is phenomenal and never makes my eyebrows too thin. She is a true artist and will not only thread your eyebrows but shape them in a perfect way that matches your face. Besides that the facility is always clean and staff is always friendly! Love this place."
3,"I went here not expecting much, but I really had a good time. We had bottle service, so we did not have to wait in line and the host were very nice and attentive. For two bottles of Goose we did not pay that much. The only bad thing I have to say about PCL is the weird transitions of the music. The DJ went from Too $hort to Ashlee Simpson. Who does that? But overall I had a great time, and if I am ever in the Scootsdale area again I will definitely be making a stop here."
0,"Went back today 12-12-12 ordered combination teriyaki bowl beef and chicken, about 5 pcs beef and 5 pcs chicken dark meat.what a rip off.don't think will be going back there again.was better before, don't know what happened."
2,"Got the bucatini and it was overcooked. Batali is all about the al dente, so I don't know what went wrong here. The wine options were pretty ridiculously expensive, as the cheapest red wine on the menu was about $16 for a glass. \n\nOverall not impressed with this Batali establishment. B&B down the hall is much better, give that a try."
2,"We stayed at the Monte Carlo because we wanted to be on the strip but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. The Monte Carlo is a very nice place- its just a little bland compared to other places I've stayed on the strip. \nOur hotel room was the average hotel room- really comfortable bed, nice bathroom. We payed $159 for a Sat night and $89 for Sunday. \nI did get to go to the pool and really liked the lazy river- but the pool area was too small for all of the moms and kids that were over crowding the place. \nThe main downfall for me is the location- it takes too long to get down to the casinos I prefer like Mirage, Venetian and Harrahs."
0,This a vape shop hah! If your just starting with kits fine. No quality or high end juices here all homemade. No authentic Mods RDA's RBA's and most of all no brand juices!!! Wont come here agian east valley vapors in mesa is wayyyy better
2,"Very busy place, and don't take reservations for large parties. Waited 45 min for dinner on Sat night group of 9.  Chips were first, followed by Guac and their version of queso fundido (melted nacho cheese).  Their Guac is good!!!  Queso F, pass on that.   They provide you with 3 salsa's with the chips.  One of the salsa was green tomatillo which was awful. It was sweetened with pineapple. Huh??  Lot's of mix and match choices. I stayed safe with enchiladas of shredded beef and spinach. Their side of of papas and chili came with most dishes, which is mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasoned with a mild chili.   I did like the spinach enchilada and papas in a comfort food way.  I tried a bite of other things from the group. This is not going to be an authentic experience, but you will be full, nice presentation, and if your in a mixed group, something for everybody.  The setting is very pleasant, and relaxing, staff was very nice.  Margarita's a little on the weak side, so order a shot on the side for the full effect."
0,"Spend your money else where!!!! This place shouldn't even get one star!!! I came in there on a Monday night about an hour before they closed wanting a polish change and some chick who looks like a witch, looked at me crazy and said \""no we're bout to close\"" with a nasty attitude. Don't even bother going here unless you don't mind feeling uncomfortable."
2,"I like playing Blackjack and my internet research pointed me in the direction of the El Cortez.\n\nUpon stepping into the casino I was pretty stoked, it had the weird gritty old school Vegas feel that I wanted on my trip.  Weird old ladies screaming at slot machines, old men wasting their pensions playing poker and drinking themselves to death... ya know that sort of thing.\n\nWhile El Cortez does have the awesomeness of a creepy casino that I'm into, the creepy kinda went into disapointing in some aspects.  Take the dealers for instance, they were all Asian (which is cool) but with names like Charley, Karen, Freddy and so forth with nametags also sporting their countries (China was well represented).  Now the name changes were kinda weird but what was weirder was they were all sorta dead eyed and practically silent.  I'm not sure if they were robots or not, but I wouldn't be surprised.  This kind of made playing cards unsettling and uncomfortable.  So I switched to slots and people watching.\n\nLater I noticed a charming dealer named Karen so I thought I'd try my luck again.  Didn't feel so freaked out and she was chatty and sarcastic and that was awesome.  But the heeby jeebies came back when her manager that may have been Dolemite in disguise basically talked to her like he was her pimp, and I was worried at any moment he'd smack a ho.  That freaked me out and again I left the table.  Only to have Dolemite stare me and my companions down with a steely look that would have killed me dead on the spot if looks could actually kill.\n\nSo if you have better nerves than I do try your luck at the tables.  If not stick to the slots and people watching."
2,"At night the shopping strip turns of their lights, only the restaurant's sign at the far end is lit. The decor is a downer, some great photos of  gauchos but otherwise brown carpet, brown walls, formica wood tables, metal chairs. At least the place was spotless so there's that. It wasn't the best time to have dinner there as there was a table of thirty people who had just sat down and that always makes it hard for the kitchen and the service. \n\nThere was only one waitress and one helper but the woman was a real pro and she remained on top of things the whole time, without running or getting flustered. Amazing. In Miami there are maybe a hundred Argentine restaurants (a half a dozen just in my neighborhood) and the competition is fierce, we're used to high standards.\n\nWe started of with empanadas ,one meat and one chicken, ridiculously cheap for a sit down restaurant: $1.50! They were the deep fried variety, I prefer the baked ones but ok. The meat filling was pretty good, but the chicken was mealy and tasted past sell date, so we skipped that. \n\nNext was the provoleta (grilled provolone) possibly because of the rush they tried serving us a microwaved cheese. I sent it back with instructions to put it in the broiler - the waitress confirmed I was right. Next was a salchicha parillera, which the same thing as a skinny grilled Italian sausage -sometimes there's cheese in it as well. It was slighlty undercooked but very good. The provoleta came back broiled so it was ok , but they should use a sharper cheese. \n\nWe shared a mixed grill for one which I always order medium rare. The steak was thick cut, but it was not vacio (known here as skirt steak or flat meat) or churrasco (the better part of the Flank)  it was a rumsteak which is neither as tender nor as tasty but acceptable. The chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage aka black pudding), molleja (sweet breads) and the asado de tira (short ribs) were all very good, but the short rib I got  was quite small. I didn't order chinchulines (tripe) because I don't like it. \n\nThe chimichurry sauce was home made and fresh. Also mild enough which is a plus, strong chimichurri tends to repeat. The sides were russian salad and regular salad nothing to say about that. \n\nThe wine is cheap, generic Argentine. The choices are Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet. Brand name \""Arge y Tina\"" (Argentina!) that generic and not even from the province of Mendoza where 90% of their wine is made. To be honest it was cheap and drinkable and it went well with the meal. \n\nOverall not great, and not bad either and reasonably priced.  If this is it as far as Argentine restaurants go in Charlotte we'll probably go back maybe once a month.... unless I find an Argentine butcher."
1,"The sales guy who helped me was a know-it-all so I ended up not purchasing anything because of his snotty attitude. The best part was him trying to sell me on purchasing a more expensive tea to go with another because the other one that I was interested in was 2x less and said it really wasn't tea. Riiiight. Small, cramped and horrible service. I felt rushed the whole time as if he had tons of customers in the store when the other 2 were already being helped or he had something better to do like whiff more loose tea in his face. You're better off ordering online than dealing with this location's unpleasant employees."
2,"I love Starbucks, but this one has terrible parking and a small sitting room.  The parking lot has like 6 spots...and no street parking!"
0,One star just because the food is good. Be prepared to wait 2 hours to see a waiter. The manager is also incompetent and a horrible at customer service. We had to ask waiters to bring things like water before finally debating on leaving without paying after no one gave us our check. Ended up paying the manager directly and storming off after a terrible dinner. At least the food was good...
4,Treehouse always has yummy cupcakes that are just the right size.  It's my chocolate fix rescue more often than not:)
3,"I was in town for a friend's bachelor party.  We were wandering through Aria - and I saw P.U.B. on the way in.  After a little indulgence in the Sports Book (solid), we checked out a few other menus before committing.  Grabbed 4 seats at the bar - hassle free.  Good bartenders - watched them officiate the 9.5 second egg timer pint chug - pretty impressed to see 3 guys get through it.  The whole experience was solid.\nWe chose to eat at the bar and met some good people - except for Jimmy O. taking an accidental dart in the eye.\nAbove average:\nDuck sliders\n\nGood: \nDirty Chips with Chicken livers\nChicken Parm sliders\nLobster roll\n\nNot so hot:\nSmoked Salmon Quesadilla - not bad, just not expected"
4,"Their website says \""The World's Greatest Hot Sandwich\"" which is true!  Although I haven't tried sandwiches in other parts of the world yet haha.  It was pretty good!  Yelpers were right on with this place!\n\nI ordered The Earl's Club (roasted turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and their sauce) and it was perfection!  Bread was crunchy and warm and everything in it was good!  The bf ordered Caribbean Jerk Chicken (grilled chicken, roasted red and banana peppers, and spicy jerk sauce) and he enjoyed it too!  I took a bite out of it and it really was good!  I'm sure the other sandwiches are good too!  I just wish they served fries with it hahaha.  I'd definitely come back here though!  There was definitely a line which proves how good it is so be ready to wait a little bit."
3,Stopped in for breakfast before heading back to SoCal. Sat on the small front patio on a nice sunny morning. I had the Josephina omelet. Very good. Mom and dad were happy with their meals too. Fantastic coffee!
1,"Le cadre est sympa, l'accueil est ok mais c\u00f4t\u00e9 nourriture j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7ue. J'ai pris le plat \""eggsuberant\"". Rien de particulier : des \u0153ufs brouill\u00e9s (qui ressemblaient plut\u00f4t \u00e0 des morceaux d'omelette\""), du bacon, des pommes de terre un peu molles, des rondelles de tomates chaudes sans m\u00eame une petite persillade, des pancakes et du sirop d'\u00e9rable. Tout \u00e9tait hyper fade! Je n'y retournerai pas. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re prendre le m\u00e9tro + bus et aller chez la \""Grand-m\u00e8re poule\"", quitte \u00e0 attendre 1 heure pour avoir une place."
1,"When traveling abroad, I've met multiple people from around the world who would tell me, after I said I was from the States, that they loved NYC.\n\nI've generally replied that NYC is the United States in name only (based on the diversity and the absence of personal motor vehicle worship for a start) and if one wanted to see what 'murica is about and meet the \""average [United States of] American\"" that one needed to get far away from there.\n\nThe Tortilla Flat rest stop is far away from there. Exploiting the legacy of the Lost Dutchman and tales of a likely fictional gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried) to create a tourist trap for those \""adventurous\"" enough to venture out in the 110-120 degree desert is also much more in line with the frontier spirit.\n\nAlmost everyone who visits here seems to be Caucasian and the average age of adults here is likely upwards of fifty. Call me a hopeless romantic but I'd like to think this is a sign of everyone else having figured out the only gold in them thar' hills is that which is transferred from visitors to the proprietors of this establishment.\n\nNo samples because we have no confidence in our products that cost more by volume than hipster favorite Churn, hate the customer if we can get away with it, and giving something away would be socialism. Why do you hate America?\n\nIn balance, it is hard to argue with Primus -- The Devil Went Down to Georgia playing anywhere when one walks in, although if Lucifer had found either pricky pear gelato or bottled water that costs more than soda I'm sure he would have been satisfied.\n\nThe Tortilla Flat stop is useful as a free bathroom in the gift shop if the kitsch doesn't overwhelm before reaching it but, otherwise, bring supplies if venturing out that way. The Wild Capitalist West preys on the unprepared."
1,"I'm DONE!!  I used to love breakfast club.  Used too.  The last 3x I have been here I have left saying \""I will never come back here\"".  This last time I meant it.  The food is good and the prices are a bargin for breakfast especially in such a great location.  It is the waitstaff that are horrible.  They NEVER smile, they are completely ANNOYED and \""put out\"" if you ask even for a napkin.  The last time we complained to the manager who looks like an extra from \""Good Fellas\"" and he could care less.  I am NEVER going back here."
4,"The donut holes, old fashioned donuts and fritters are amazing. Coffee is delicious too! So much better than any of the competitors. I am not even a big donut person but every now and then when it is time for donuts, this is where I go!"
4,"i love this place. i can always spent all my money here on something.  they have great sales racks, but also reasonable clothes not on sale too. the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly. Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes, they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy."
1,"I've been here twice so far. The first experience was a bit underwhelming, but having heard good things, I decided to try again. Our visit today began with a rocky start. My friend and I both ordered coffee. The coffee arrived with a bowl full of crinkled up brown equal and Splenda packets and the tiniest little pot of cream I've ever seen. The server was nice enough to run to the kitchen to bring us some real sugar. Alas, once it arrived, there weren't any spoons to stir the sweet goodness into our cups. \n\nFast forward to the food. The grits tasted like a strange sweet creamed corn and the chorizo omelet was just okay. My friend ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon. Let me just say, hashbrowns do not mean cubed fried potatoes. I mean really, they're like mini-fries. What is the fun in that? And the scrambled eggs? Well, they were a bit creamy. I think they were underdone. \n\nTheir menu has a lot of variety and I give them kudos for that. However, I can't say that they do any of it well. The view is nice and the vibe is chill. Other than that, I don't think I want to eat here again. Perhaps just drink?"
1,"After visiting Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I was expecting even more from the Smiling Banana Leaf, as per the reviews--but I was a little let down. \n\nI'm not sure if my ordering was off, but I found a theme in sauces and dressings that were just too sweet. \n\nWe started with the spring roll, steamed dumplings and the calamari. The spring roll was quite good, steamed dumplings were very light and well seasoned and the calamari was good, but a bit overcooked. It was a little too chewy because of it, but it wasn't a bit greasy and the coating was perfect. However, the dipping sauce was extremely sweet and almost like jam. I preferred the dumpling dipping sauce for it. \n\nThe glass noodle salad was heavily, heavily dressed with a dressing that would have benefitted from  healthy does of acid and much less sweetness. However, the meat in the salad was generous and the shrimp in the salad was well cooked. The vegetables, specifically the onions, were rather huge pieces, while there seemed to be an under representation in the \""greens\"" department. Honestly, by the time I finished my salad I couldn't really taste a whole lot because it was just SO sweet. \n\nThe pad thai, at a 7 level hotness, wasn't very hot. And again, it was pretty sweet. There weren't very many bean sprouts and the meat chunks were huge. The curried noodles, at a hotness of 5, had a delicious sauce, but the noodles were pretty overcooked. \n\nIt could be, we caught the restaurant on a off day, as it was a holiday weekend. It could be, I just ordered badly, as the neighboring diners food looked delicious. The ambiance is quite adorable and the service is good. I would give it another shot before declaring it a no-go zone."
0,"First off I will agree, the staff are friendly.  That is pretty much all this restaurant has going for it though.  Never having eaten here, my husband and I decided to give it a try for takeout.  We were told 10 minutes on a to go order which ended up taking about 25 minutes.  Seriously 3 other people placed to go orders, received their food, and left in the time we waited.  The staff was very apologetic and threw in an order of egg rolls for free in spite of the fact that we had not complained at all about the wait time.  So service is good, but what really counts is the food.  I really had a good idea when we unpackaged the meal and took out the glow in the dark pink sweet and sour sauce.  If a restaurant is going to serve over processed, sub par condiments there isn't much hope for the food.  The egg rolls were extremely greasy and rather tasteless.  The pork fried rice was over all rather bland and had a previously frozen quality to it.  Nothing tasted remotely fresh.  Finally the coconut chicken we ordered was inedible.  The chicken was stringy and so hard you could not stab it with a fork let alone chew it.  The sauce again appeared to be processed but since we couldn't eat the chicken it was hard to really gage it's quality.  To sum up we paid over $20.00 for some rice that tasted like what my mom used to make from a box in the 70's and greasy egg rolls.  We could have gone down the street to Panda Express for half the price and twice the quality.  Pretty sad when the fast food option is better than the sit down."
3,"Great little spot. Drinks are more than reasonably priced, staff is friendly and competent, atmosphere is pretty cool. I'm here with some friends from work and it's a great way to end the week."
2,"Great service & nice looking burger & breakfast joint. They have a large variety menu from breakfast burritos, salads to other sandwiches. I ordered the Chicken Gyro & was very disappointed & wifey ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, neither came with fries & was not worth it! Will give it another try but will order breakfast or burgers since thats the main name of this place."
3,"Kind of expensive for a quick treat! The different smoothies are almost too good to resist thought! One of my favorites is the pink starburst! If you haven't tried them, you should stop in for a quick treat! They are friendly at this location too!"
4,"I have to give a shout out to the oyster man on the sidewalk.  Wonderful oysters (seriously), friendly service, conveniently located (I don't have to shove through people in the market), and cheap.  At $1 a piece, or like 3 for $5, or 6 for $10-something like that-you really can't go wrong.  I've had two different shuckers that were both extremely friendly and conversational.  They shuck the oyster right there while you wait.  They have lemon, horse radish, and hot sauce on the whim, right there at the little stand! \n\nIf you happen to be passing by, stop and say hello and grab a fresh cold oyster!  I was trying to make it every Friday for a drive by oyster snack during nice weather.  I'm not sure if they're open during the winter, but be sure to check!  I brought an out of town oyster guru friend and he thought they were amazing.  Winner!\n\nAs for the store, they have a great selection of seafood.  Being from Houston, I'm used to the crawfish, catfish, fried shrimp kind, but much prefer the selection here.  It's a little pricey, but nothing outrageous.  I love the hustle and bustle of a seafood market and this place doesn't disappoint!  A slice of San Francisco in the Burgh.\n\nThey also have other items besides just seafood.  And sidewalk oysters!"
4,"King Crab Legs say whaaaat?!??! \n\nAnother great buffet with amazing service! and one of the best prime rib ive ever had! tender flavorful juicy, but enough about me ;) \n\nThis was the first buffet i went to when as soon as i checked into my hotel! and i am SO glad i went! the food was Fantastic! One of my favorite dishes was the Prime rib of course, the spinach and cheese ravioli and the fresh crepes! \n\nOh man i almost lost it when i saw a personal crepe chef making her creations for everyone!.. only in Vegas i tells ya!  \n\nThe food was so good that i even came back for breakfast! mmmmmm"
3,"Great little gourmet ice cream shop inside the California Hotel. Always a good flow of customers and great service. The ladies that work there are sweethearts, my kids loved them. The first time I came here was because I was on the hunt for some shave ice nearby. Little did I know they had amazing ice cream here! Flavors like MACADAMIA NUT, MANILA MANGO, PISTACHIO WITH EGYPTIAN PISTACHIOS, RUM RAISIN, GREEN TEA... just to name a few. Honestly you can't go wrong with anything you order here but I'd recommend the MACADAMIA NUT & MANILA MANGO. Such a great combo. It's a very generous scoop of ice cream so make sure you take someone along with you to share. Gotta try the malasadas next time."
4,"I'm a huge fan of this place.  It's an actual sports bar, in a part of town choking to death on crappy franchise restaurants.  Expect efficient, friendly staff, seriously good pizza and wings, and good drink specials.  It's a busy bar, so if you're looking for a sub-2 minute greet on a Friday night, go to Chili's.  The service at Picasso's is good, but it's not A) a family restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.  It's a sports bar, so tip well, enjoy the food, and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in."
3,"My girls (age 6 & 8) love coming here for the Parent's Night Out.  It costs me $25 each to drop them off to play and have pizza from 7pm-11pm.  \n\nI wish the hours were 6pm to 10pm instead.  Also, my daughter said the pizza wasn't very good last time.\n\nHowever, the pros outweigh the cons and we are fans."
3,"What a beautiful place to sit with friends around the fire and enjoy some wine and food!  The fish fish tacos got the group vote for the fav HH food.  The crab cake cake was tiny and not impressive.  Whereas the cheese plate was more savory with a little something for everyone.  If you are looking for a patio setting, then you can't go wrong here."
4,"my family (18 of us) all got together for my cousins 30th...we wanted to go somewhere nice but nothing too much as there was nearly 20 of us.\nThis wolfgang restaurant is exactly what we wanted +more.  Our server was fun, professional, and attentive.  My dad and i shared a ceaser salad, calamari, and a mushroom pizza...others around the table opted for chicken picatta, other kinds of pizzas, fish, calzones, eggplant....everyone loved their food and everyone loved their cocktails.....would go here again in a heart beat."
2,"I have eaten here on numerous occasions and have found it to be a little over-hyped. I think that food tastes better when your drunk and that is partially responsible for people raving about it. I would rate their sandwiches as \""good\"" not \""excellent\"". What I have always found to be subpar is their bread. It's always very dry. I did rate it as good however and that's what you'll find here. Good not great."
1,"The Bay, seulement trois choses \u00e0 en dire:\n- La d\u00e9co est horrible & la boutique tr\u00e8s mal dispos\u00e9e\n- C'est trop cher et la s\u00e9lection v\u00eatements n'est pas terrible\n- Le personnel n'est absolument pas aimable\nJ'y vais juste pour la section cuisine qui est plut\u00f4t bien achanland\u00e9e et \u00e0 des prix corrects (pour La Baie)..."
4,"My wife bought me a gift card to V's for Christmas 10 years ago.  I was skeptical at first ...I'd been an $8 haircut guy up until then... but that all changed.  Since then I don't think I've been anywhere else to get a haircut.  The haircut is great, but the service and atmosphere are a welcome change from your regular salon experience.  I usually have Yelenna cut my hair if I make an appointment, but also do a walk-in if scheduling is an issue.\n\nNormally I do just a cut and a wash every 5 weeks or so.  A few times a year I'll treat myself to The Whole Deal (Haircut, Shave & Facial) and it is THE BEST.  I wish I could afford this every time.  \n\nIf I could change anything I'd bring back the beer and cigars you used to be able to have in the chair.  But the world changes I guess.  \n\nThey do a great job and treat you right.  Best haircut & shave I've ever had."
0,"This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized, they just said \""we get a lot of elderly people in here so we often lose our patience.\""  They still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card.  If you want to be treated with respect and have competent, respectful service, DO NOT get your prescriptions here."
4,"Just look at the name of this place, QuikTrip, if you are on the road and need a quick stop to get either something to drink, free air for your tires, or cheap gas, this is the place to be.  I need premium gas for my car, so this place usually and always have cheaper gas, probably somewhere between 10 to 20 cents cheaper from all other major gas stations.  So I would definitely recommend this place if you are on the run."
0,"Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple \""I'm sorry for the wait\"" would have gone a long way.\n\nThere were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. \n\nWe sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening\n\nWhile waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. \n\nFinally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). \n\nMy wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, \""For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal.\"" I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. \n\nWhile waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. \n\nAnyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, \""Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints.\"" Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!"
3,"I think I like this waffle house location less than the one on N 59th and the 1-10, though this one is slightly less ghetto. This location is usually pretty busy, but good thing is that the service is pretty fast and the food quality is still good. I would advise not sitting by the bar where the sink is. If someone is having a bad day, they might splash a lot of soapy water near your food! \n\nThe servers are nice and they make the food relatively quickly considering how many people come in and out in an hour's time. It's cheap, good eats and fun to go to once in awhile for breakfast/brunch."
1,"Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 servie une demi heure apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 arriv\u00e9e et il n'y avait que 3 tables d'occuper dans la salle.

Bon, moi je n'y retournerais pas ... \n\nLe service est pourrie\nLes assiettes sont minuscules \nIl y as des c\u0153ur d'ananas dans les plats \nWhat the fuck. \nHeureusement le chocolat \u00e9tait bon."
3,"Visited Morty's with a pack of hungry girl friends.\nService was blisteringly fast on this wing-special night. Staff was running everywhere.\n\nThe wings are indeed one of the best I've had in a long time. And at 59 cents it's hard to get better value for money.\nWe obviously ordered way more than we could handle. But had a bit of a surprise when we were charged a buck for a take out container.\n\nA little weird, but understandable with an eat-in special.\nWell -most definately- visit again!"
4,"Dr. Mark Fleming is now the dentist at Belmont Dental Care so please do not confuse him with the previous dentist and those reviews.  I was referred to Dr. Fleming by my dentist in the Seattle area who was in the process of doing major dental work.  Having had many negative experiences with dentists in the past I was concerned about trying again.  Dr. Fleming was fabulous!  Not only did he see me on a moments notice, he was gentle, extremely professional, knowledgeable and took unlimited time to handle my issues.  As a result of my experiences with him I highly recommend him as the best in the Scottsdale area.  His staff is great and his office very upscale.  Add to all of this he has a sense of humor and many years of experience not only as a dentist but additionally as a teaching dentist in the area.  You can't go wrong!  He is excellent!"

3,Went here for restaurant week and enjoyed the 9 oz pork while my date had the Salmon. \n\n\nBoth plates were prepared deliciously and the hot rolls they bring you are just delicious. \n\nThe service was as expected of a higher end joint and the tables were cleared immediately after courses were completed. \n\n\nI was very satisfied with my experience here.
4,"Paige has done It again, I go in looking like I have a Loofah on the back of my head, and she comes back and makes me look and feel like a million bucks!! she's amazing and gets it right every time Thank youii"
1,"Took 45 minutes to get our food. The kids ordered Mac and Cheese, wife ordered salmon and I ordered the spicy tuna roll. Why the delay? No explanation, just an apology and they comped the Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately we won't be back. Service here in the past has been brutal... Too bad."
4,"Gary is honest, reliable and completes work fast. I have left my auto with him over a week to find it ready when I returned on Monday! Fast, reliable, dependable, and honest! Really great guy!! Thanks Gary for doing great work at really great and affordable prices"
4,"We ended up here because of the reviews we saw on yelp, and we weren't disappointed.  Great appetizers and great food!!!"
2,"Bathtub clogged on first night. Shuttle bus us Extremely late! Pick up is at half the hour at request only, they don't arrive until at least :45 after the hour. Pickup at the fashion district is beyond late! I've been waiting here since 5:20pm for the 5:30 pick up. It's now 6:40pm. I called the front desk, they said it'll be here in 15 mins. Times a wasting! The drop off/pickup location at the fashion district is 1 mile away ."
3,"I've been here once, but I thought it was great.  I had the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese and it was so light and flavorful, like gnocchi should be.  I honestly don't think I've had gnocchi that good.... ever.  Also, the prices were more reasonable than some of the other options, because if they weren't, trust me, we wouldn't have ended up eating there :)"
0,"There store is huge and seems to have all the sporting goods you can think of.\nI had stopped by 2 weeks ago to look for running shoes. I was in hurry so I was hoping to go in quickly find a pair and be out of there. The store wasn't too busy and there were 2 or 3 employees in the shoe department. Now the shoe department was busier than the rest of the store. I look around for a couple minutes. Good selection, good prices.\nI find two pair of shoes I'm interested in trying on and grab them so I can have a sales associate grab them from the back. Stood there a minute, I was ignored.\nTried flagging two associates down as they walked by; ignored.\nIt's like I was invisible. I didn't have time to wait so I left.\nI came back again today, this time with more time to spend. I found 3 pairs of shoes to try one grabbed them stood around again and waited. Ignored even when I tried to wave someone down. I went and sat on a bench and tried some of the new Reebok RunTone shoes that were on display since these were one of only 3 or maybe 4 styles total that had a whole size run of the shoes to try on. I sat there on the bench, open box of shoes on the floor, my shoes on the floor, new ones on my feet and 3 display shoes on the bench next to me. I was never even so much as acknowledged. One employee walked briskly by me. I said \""Excuse me, can you...\"" and he walked right by me to greet someone else.\nThe guy he had greeted had a single pair of shoes in his hand. I had actually looked at them before choosing the 3 I was interested in trying and they were $30 cheaper than anything I wanted.\nSo whats the deal? I had showered, was dressed well, my clothes were clean, I didn't have an screaming children with me.\nI know I don't look like I'm there to buy shoes for my next marathon or anything, but regardless, I'm there to buy shoes. I am there with money to spend. \nToo bad these employees are either too useless or too stupid to realize that."
4,"I've been seeing Dr. Docasar for several years and I would put my life in her hands, which I've done once already.  She is very caring and sincere, listens to my concerns and makes wonderful recommendations of supplements that don't require a prescription.\n\nIt was Dr. Docasar that got my out-of-control fibroids under control several years ago by doing an ablation, even going out of her way to bring in a machine from out of state for the procedure.  The recovery time was really quick with very little pain.  I understand she's now able to do the procedures in the office.\n\nI'm currently undergoing painful menstrual cycles as my hormones are having a great time changing, and Dr. Docasar is working with me, discussing different options and providing an understanding ear.  It is very comforting to have someone I can trust so much that I've referred her to my sisters and friends."
3,I visited Macayo's with a friend last night before a concert. The food was wonderful (love the half-price appetizer happy hour!) and we had great service. I was a little disappointed at the beer selection for happy hour. No Dos Equis Amber on draft but you have Corona Light? Bummer!
2,"Food was good and they don't hold back on the spice like other places. I had the eggplant/broccoli; a minor detail is that the dish is stuffed with carrots and onions too (more than eggplant or broccoli). The flavor was good tough. The only service issue was the 50 minute wait for 3 dishes, which is not acceptable. It seemed like everyone around us was just waiting."
4,Wow!  Easy ordering for big groups (do it here on yelp!) and delicious.  Worth every penny.  Large drink = 2 cans of soda.
4,"I am a meat lover! That said... this is one of only two vegan friendly / vegetarian focused restaurants that I love and crave! I love the ambiance with friends, and you can't beat their black iced chai!"
1,"Saying the sushi here is overpriced is an understatement. Especially in a town that has plenty of great local sushi places. Service was a tad overbearing. Asked the waiter to give us something different, he brought us california rolls with real crab. Meh."
0,Wow people in this store are rude. I was in there exactly 2 minutes and was shocked at how rude the print lady was.  Not gonna go there again.
0,"BEWARE! I have never left a review for anything online! But this could not go without a warning to other Mom's!\nAfter nearly a month of email correspondece, I ordered a train shaped cake from this company for my son's 3rd birthday.  A rectangle cake with a screen print was dropped off at the party.  Immediately called the delivery girl and said the wrong cake was dropped off and she said she had nothing to do with it but would notify the owner.  I proceeded to spend the whole party trying to call with no response.  Finally got a phone call the next day from A BLOCKED NUMBER, and the  owner Liz who said she would refund me $20?  She also let me know that I should have immediately called the delivery girl and had her pick up the cake??  And had a 3yr old with no birthday cake??  DIRECT QUOTE: \"" IF YOU WERE SOO DISAPPOINTED WHY DIDNT YOU CALL THE DELIVERY GIRL BACK AND HAVE HER PICK UP THE CAKE\""! \nThis woman is nuts.. She never addressed the issue that she had made the wrong cake or apologized.  She even had the nerve to tell me I should be grateful because no other cake company in Phoenix would have done a train shaped cake for $95! HELLO,,, NEITHER DID YOU!!\n I am now dealing with my credit card company...\nTHERE IS A REASON THIS COMPANY NO LONGER HAS A STORE FRONT!"
0,"Went here on 6-4-14 around 12 noon. The burgers had no flavor, the fries were covered in tons of salt, and the onion rings were so gummy and the batter wasn't good at all! The one girl at the register was wiping down tables and counters when she could with the same rag she was using to wipe down the little trays the burgers were placed in. All they do is put a new wax paper liner between them! Not to mention the price was kinda expensive for burgers. At least the Buns were great whatever bakery they use for those knows how to cook."
0,On my cross country road trip unfortunately you get tired and have to stay somewhere....there are a few motels in the vicinity but i like this one because of the lighting in the front.  I have my truck filled with all my belongings and i needed the safest place i felt to park.  That is the only plus..the night manager is the rudest jack off on the face of the earth...first thing he asked me was where am i coming from...i stated San Francisco area..going to NC...he automatically assumed i was gay...because when my GF walked in tje lobby..he said...oh....i thought you was riding with your other type of girlfriend....i het the key to my room and it smelled like somebody was actually smoking in there..thats how bad it was....i asked for a non smoking room and he told me all the non smoking rooms was filled....i know with the 4 cars in the parking lot....the room...semen filled bed sheets....hair from the other guestbin the shower...toilet that hasnt been cleaned in 3 weeks...the smoke detector wires that hanging from the ceiling. The floor that hasnt seen a vacuum in 5 months...who knows what was growing in the freezer the tv from 1982...this motel is definitely a spot where truck drivers brings hookers not a place to stay if you looking for a nice night of sleep if you traveling
1,"Maybe I'm a Mexican-food snob, but this was basically overpriced-Del Taco fare.\nThe food was nothing to write home about. It was served on Styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking."
2,"This place is pretty good.  Tried the Italian Beef and although it's not up to par as some other places, it's fairly good.  Problem is the beef has a strong vegetable taste to it..??..?? and the gravy is a bit salty.  Cheese was melted perfectly.  \n\nService was very good.  Very attentive staff who took their time and answered all of my questions."
4,Our waitor was fabulous. And we had a great dining experience. The food was also excellent and very well priced. No wonder the Cortez Room is a locals favorite.
0,"Now all of you reviewers need to tell me what you did for service?\n\nRegardless if happy hour is discounted pricing, you all understand that's probably one of their busiest times of day. \nConsidering its the time of day people are getting out of work, if you hand a menu to someone and disappear for 30 minutes it's hard to sit still. \n\nWe came in at the beginning of happy hour! Seated ourselves near the little booths by the bar. It took 13 minutes just for a menu. NOT COOL.luckily my boyfriend and I have some amazing conversations or else I don't know how else to let the time pass. \n\nWe eventually got our menus l, took a look. In a matter of minutes, especially after waiting so long for a menu, we finally are ready to give her the rundown on everything we want. \n\nWe keep seeing the same server rush back and forth so we keep waiting. After we see her and have her tell us she's about ready to take our drink order, she looks over and sees a party of 20 rush outside. \nWhere do you think our server went?!\n\nNever got to put that drink order in :( \nAll we wanted was a nice happy hour!\nAfter all, grandma had the little one all day so we might as well take advantage. \n\nAfter being so patient to try out this elegant restaurant, we thought maybe yard house was a better choice. They know us there so there's never waiting for a drink! \n\n\nMaybe we gotta be dressed lookin like a million bucks, or go with a fat group! \nI wanna try it again, my man was just really tryin to get that happy hour on so it might take a little convincing."
0,"Went on super bowl sunday night since i heard wiz kalifa was performing.. Once We walked into the hotel, a promoter gives us passes to get in free and and a drink ticket.. unexpectedly came up we thought.  Once we got there the cashier was a bitch and basically denied us the paases and free drink ticket..bull shit promoter.\n\nWent in.. poppin for a sunday but a very cheap looking crowd.. We walked around and there was no space.  Went to the bar for my third drink, the bartender straight up said hun, i wont be getting to you. At that point I was way over it.  Wiz wasnt worth a waste of my time. So we bounced at 1am and went to xs at the encore.  Great change up and people were actually respectable and a more attractive crowd."
2,"*I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, gaaah! So let's just say, 3.5.*\n\nMet Monica O. and Preston S. here for lunch a couple of months back.\n\nKind of cramped atmosphere, and the d\u00e9cor is interesting to say the least. Like someone couldn't choose a theme. But, that adds character! \n\nI had heard great things about the Sakana Lunch ($10). \n\nYou get miso soup, a small salad, six nigiri pieces, your typical crunchy-saucy California-esque roll and a crunchy crab jalape\u00f1o popper roll. \n\nDid I mention this was all for $10? So much food! Couldn't even finish mine. \n\nThe miso soup was meh, but really enjoyed the ginger dressing used on the salad. \n\nIs it the freshest sushi in the world? Definitely not. But you have to remember, this is Arizona. At least it didn't seem suspect. \n\nService is friendly, yet a bit on the slow side, so wouldn't recommend Sakana if you're tight on time during a workday lunch. I likely won't come back for lunch as my work falls into the \""nearby, but not so nearby\"" when you throw in the time factor. \n\nIs Sakana going to blow your mind? Likely not for those sushi connoisseurs out there. But I'd like to give them another try for dinner."
3,olive garden is consentant that is why they stay busy.  We havent been to one in a while so last night we thought it would be a good idea to try something different.  Dinner was good app took 15 mins but things happen I understand. Overall it was a good dinner just the girl and I.
2,"I booked an appointment for a friday at 11:00. I had the day off with my parents visiting and I heard weekend appointments were crazy busy. I had some dresses \""saved\"" on their website and they were able to pull those up in the store. The sales associate was nice, helped find the dresses I was interested in and showed me where to look through the racks for more styles. \n\nI found a dress I really liked, it was a little more than what I wanted to spend though. I also had a second bridal shop appointment after this one, so I had to give the other place a chance too. \n\nThe sales associate gave me her card and told me I could call anytime to purchase the dress as she wrote down the size and style number. I didn't end up purchasing from David's because I ended up finding a gown at my second appointment which was within my budget. \n\nOverall there wasn't anything particularly negative....or positive. Just kind of sandwiched in the middle. I wasn't dissapointed, but I wasn't wowed either. Considering a lot of other shops out there, they still offer some very pretty gowns and reasonable prices. Still worth checking out."
2,I really like the location of the hotel. However the rooms and service are just average and therefore overpriced for what you get. The rooms are not that clean and the bathrooms are not well designed. If the rooms were 50% cheaper I would recommend this place.
1,"I already know that my taste buds are different than most people's but I did not like the food here AT ALL.  You know it's bad when you're sitting there wishing you were eating a McDonald's Big Mac instead!  I've tried many other burgers in town - Gordon Ramsay BurGR, BLT Burger, Burger Bar, Holstein's, Commes Ca - and I liked them all better than the one I had at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Some of those burgers I might have thought were nothing special but were at the very least ok.  Even the burger I had at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill, which I thought had a weird taste to it, tasted better than the burger I got here, which was just \""meh.\""  Didn't like the bun, didn't like the meat, therefore didn't like the burger.  Also, the vanilla shake I got was just \""ok\"" at best.  I like my shakes thick but theirs was on the runnier side.  Definitely can't compare to the delicious shakes at Gordon Ramsay BurGR!  Or even Jack in the Box for crying out loud! :p  I tried to eat as much of my food as possible though - $40 for a burger meal for two and it's not even a sit-down type of restaurant?  Yikes!!  Note, if you get the combo of sides and choose onion rings as one option, you get only two onion rings!  (They are big ones though.)\n\nThe place was already busy at noon on a Sunday of a holiday weekend when I went, and half an hour later just about every table was taken, at least outside.  If you do sit outside, they will bring condiments, napkins, and silverware to you.  Also beware of the flies/gnats out there.\n\nService: courteous and efficient but robotic.  \n\nGive this place a try if you must.  On to the next one for me."
0,"All I wanted was an international phone card. Every Walmart in the country sells them. For some reason this one doesn't. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes of looking, I decided to ask a worker working in the electronics departments. I ask him: \""Where can I find the phone cards?\"". He replies: \""Uggh?\"". I ask again: He replies: \""What?\"". I spell it out for him: \""P-H-O-N-E C-A-R-D-S\"". He replies: \""Huh?\""\n\nI decide to ask another worker next to the paper towels. He replies: \""What?\"". I try again. He replies: \""What?\"" I leave and attempt to ask another worker. \n\nNow, both these workers were White-American men in their 20s who had southern accents. Yet, for some reason they couldn't communicate using the English language.  I would expect that from recent immigrants, most particularly from all the Russian, Asian and South American immigrants here in LV, but not those guys.. Whats going on here in Las Vegas? No one speaks English anymore, not even the White folks whose families were probably here when the Declaration of Independence was signed! \n\nFor my 3rd attempt I try to ask an African-American worker. I ask him: \""Where are the phone cards?\"". Guess what his answer is? He replies: \""WHAT?\"" I am now extremely irritated. I attempt to ask again, and FINALLY he gives me directions to the department where I can find them. He tells me to go to a particular isle, and then walks off. I then walked over to that isle, and it was the motherf*cking Soda Isle. Now, I was really pissed. \n\nI then walked over to the supervisor who appeared to have been of Filipino or Chinese descent. I ask her the same question I asked everyone else. Guess what her reply was? No, I really want you to guess what her motherf*cking reply was? \""WWHHHHAAATTT???\"". \n\nI then went to another supervisor who was of Latino descent. Finally I got a real answer. But, it was a stupid one. She said that Walmart doesn't sell phone cards. Well, I have been buying phone cards from Walmart for the last 5 years, so I think she might have been a little incorrect in her answer. \n\nIt was at this particular time that I blew up. Believe me, I had one of my stereotypical profanity filled violent blowups right next to the customer service booth. \n\nIronically, when I am walking out the door I see a badly bent and torn international phone card laying on the floor near the hair saloon. So it proves that they do have them somewhere in the store. \n\nWhat is it that causes people here in LV to lose the ability to articulate speech and all verbal language skills? Is it drugs? Is it the intense heat? Is it the poor public schools? Something is causing massive brain damage in this town."
1,"2 because the service was fine. So far worst buffet in Vegas on the strip. \""seafood buffet\"" $20 crappy. The omelet station was the best part"
4,"This place is hands down AMAZING. Food is out of this world and clever beyond anything I would have expected. Customer service is phenomenal and everyone is so accommodating and informative. The ribs, spicy Mac and cheese, quesadilla and fried potato chips are all SO SO good."
0,"I frequently(once a/wknd) come here to gamble as I am a local and it is only ten minutes away from home, but that will change especially will my experience this past weekend. I know this might sound like sour grapes b/c I lost money, but I have lost money here before and never had an issue. Well anyway I visited to gamble this past Sunday night and was there for approximately 5-6 hrs lost money no big deal. Except for the last 45mins-hour at the BJ table I encountered the most unprofessional ass of a dealer ever, never have I encountered a dealer laughing and rubbing in the fact that he kept getting 20 and that I was losing, his name was Terry. Please understand I'm used to gambling and understand sometimes you lose, but this man was cheering for that fact that he was winning which I have never seen before.  I ended losing 900 that night which in the end isn't a big deal as I've had previous nights losing here before. But the reason I'm giving this casino a bad review is the lack of professionalism and the fact that I came back the next night and asked for a $25 comp to fatburger and was turned away by the casino host, now I don't know if it's because I'm a young man or a \""kid\"" (I'm 26 btw) or the fact that it doesn't look like I spend a lot of money here even though I get free $75 table bets here every week but never before have I ever been treated like a second class patron here til this week. Its a very nice looking hotel and casino and my previous visits they were  usually great to me but after this recent experience, I will take my business elsewhere and now understand why the place was so empty. I am a loyal patron to station casinos so I would probably only visit red rock across town from now on."
4,"Everything was delicious. We had two kinds of bun and two kinds of broken rice, and I've rarely had better."
1,"The coffee was cold, the food was blah.  Nothing special and not worth the wait! The only thing that was to die for was the fried oreos--Amazing!"
1,"I was there for a work dinner...I sat next to a co-workers wife who I did not know. We both ordered the 8oz fillet cooked medium; they both came back rare. We sent them back, which was no big deal, I had my sides on my plate and hers on her plate. They returned both our steaks, unfortunately they did not replete them on new plates AND they put my steak on her plate and her steak on my plate, we only knew this because we had different sides. VERY amature. Our server could care 'o less...he was probably upset that the wine we ordered wasn't $300 a bottle. I pointed out the error, they were semi-concerned. I didn't really complain, but wasn't too happy. The manager came over and apparently knew what happened, she graciously took both of our meals off the bill. I was appreciative. I would still not go back."
0,"Today I needed to change pharmacy because my current one will not, for whatever reason, give out the birth control Junel (they use to, but then switched to Micro-crap). Ever since taking Micro-crap I have been getting huge cysts on my ovaries which was NEVER problem with Junel, or a problem before taking any pill. S now I have to have the name brand Junel only, and so I went off to Walgreens thinking they would have it.\nWell they don't. But this is not a review on what they have or don't have; this review is on the horrible service of the so called pharmacist there. First off he goes into a five minute rant about how Micro-crap and Junel are the SAME thing, deriving from Loestrin. Well, I am not a doctor nor a pharmacist, but if that were true then both filled perscriptions would say \""generic for Loestrin\"". They don't. Only Junel says that. Micro-crap says it is generic- FOR JUNEL!\nWhatever. I will ignore this, I thought at the least. Until he asks why on earth my doctor would specify for Junel only. \""Because Micro-crap gives me cysts.\""\n\""Well that has nothing to do with birth control.\""\n....Excuse me? It doesn't? Well by god I have ben wasting my time at the doctors, when here in this Walgreens is a man who knows all about my ovaries and give FREE medical service! I will quickly fire my GP and come to you dear sir for all my medical needs.\nBut wait, he is not a DOCTOR. Honestly what the hell is problem? He then went off about my doctor and cysts, and I left. \nA simple \""No, we don't carry that.\"" would have sufficed. But no, he had to be a jerk about it and talk down to me and my doctor, who I will take over his crazyness any day."
2,"As a vegetarian,  Jack in the Box isn't exactly my first choice for fast food.  That doesn't stop my husband,  however,  from dragging me along whenever he gets a craving for Jack in the Box. This location is closest to home and is a quick and easy option for a late night snack or lazy breakfast. \n\nWhat I like about this Jack in the Box is that it's clean and riff-raff is in general kept to a minimum. The employees are always polite and our orders are placed correctly. The drive-thru always seems to take forever though...\n\nAs for food, c'mon, it's Jack in the Box!"
4,"We love it at Good Fellas. Nino's is very personable and always makes you feel welcome. The food is priced very reasonably and is excellent value. If you like flavorful good Greek food, you've come to the best place!! It's easy to select meal as they have photos. Everything is delicious...We have tried different dishes...the meat dishes taste good and moist, not dry, the rice is flavorful, both lentil and potato soups are very good. Comfortable dining area. We've taken our relatives here and will continue to patronize the restaurant. You will not regret it. Thanks Nino."
1,"There has to be a good reason my parents would never let me eat at Jollibee when I was little.  They always told me the burgers are made of worms. Somebody gave me a burger from Jollibee and I would not touch it.\n\nThis is a Filipino fast-food joint. It's like the Filipino Mickey D's. It's not fusion or anything. Filipino, Filipino, Filipino! Pinoy! From the food to the old ladies that cut in line in front of you. And no, this is definitely not the best burger anywhere. Whoever says that it is is a liar...just because you saw Jollibee in Bourdain's show, doesn't mean you have to believe it. I would not recommend a Jollibee burger to anyone.\n\nI've had their Chicken Joy and that's alright.  I'm not a fan of Filipino spaghetti with the sweet sauce and red hotdogs (also made with worms according to my folks). The only thing I like from this place is Peach Mango Pie.\n\nYears later...parentless and living in Vegas...feeling like a rebel, I finally got the urge to try their burger. It's one of those \""The Prodigal Son\"" moments where I was like \""I should've listened to my parents\"". Pack this!"
0,Awful food. Only one dish was edible and the selection was not good. Staff we rude and plates were dirty. Please do not waste your hard earned money here.
2,"The Fishmarket in Baxter is truly what it bills itself as...a unique restaurant in a unique atmosphere. The food has been great every time we've been. If you want a better seafood experience from a food standpoint, you'll need to get on your horse and head up to LaVecchia's in Uptown Charlotte...and even then, you may not do better. Probably need to go even farther, say, to Charleston, and check out Hank's before you'll find a rival any closer. \n\nThe Sunday brunch is also unbeatable. $2 mimosas and $3 bloody Marys are hard to beat, especially in Fort Mill, where several restaurants still lack the special Sunday liquor license... \n\nUnfortunately, Sunday brunch is 100% of the business we do at this restaurant anymore...because we can serve ourselves. This is the first restaurant where I've taken off two stars for poor service, mainly because that is what precludes us from enjoying dinner here anymore. When I go to a restaurant that bills itself to be at this caliber, I've come to expect a couple of things from the wait staff...here are a few: 1) Be knowledgeable about the menu, when asked for a recommendation (I do NOT want to hear \""oh, I don't eat fish\"" from a server at a seafood restaurant...go work at Applebees). 2) PLEASE come by my table more than once during a service...and that was just to drop off the bill, after one of her counterparts did the majority of the work. Wasn't sure who I was tipping? 3) Don't flirt with the bartender while you are on the clock, and I'm not being served. 4) Don't complain about how crappy your job is to other servers within earshot of customers, while those customers are waiting on you. 5) Do NOT, while I'm still sitting at the table, pick up the bill book once I've written my tip, open it while standing at the table to SEE what kind of tip I left, and then walk away without a word (don't know what he was upset about...it was a 20% tip....even WITH the crappy service!). 6) Don't be slower than Christmas, with EVERYTHING, and seem like it is an inconvenience to you when I ask for more water. \n\nThese examples are from multiple trips, and multiple different servers observed. Basically, a lack of server education/professionalism is evident at the restaurant. I wish I could rate it higher, because the food is definitely worthy. If the front of the house management does a better job hiring/training front of the house staff, we will return for more than just brunch."
0,Between the servers talking crap about patrons or the servers kids running around my table and honestly its about the homeliest staff ive ever seen i cant go back. The servers need to shut up and the person who hires needs to be fired
2,"since O was my first show, i only had that to compare it to. this is not that great compared to O. \n\nDAMN.....i thought this would get the juices flowing, but definitely didn't. their catch phrase is \""the sensual side of cirque du soleil\"" so i definitely was expecting more but then again they used the word \""sensual\"" and not \""sexual\"". \n\ni saw topless girls, but that's not what i wanted to see! \n\nMEN, you should drop those tights."
2,"Hmm...sadly, not enough menu... :( ... Margarita would've been awesome, till I found a \""Fruit Fly\"" in my drink...hmm... other than that, staff were great and great location..."
4,"Great breakfast spot, lunch spot, top-notch customer service and yes, decent non-Starbuckian Iced Coffee!\n\nFor breakfast, I suggest Lemon Ricotta short stack...\nFor lunch, Chicken Pomegranate Pistachio salad..."
0,"cold food after sending back several times. med well served medium rare, then over cooked. cold plates. service slow on a slow night. high prices not even close to being worth it     have had same problem several times before."
3,This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. Very surprised at how good the food was. Quick service too.
1,"I went to Los Dos Molinos with high hopes, having heard great things about it.  The service was decent, though the wait staff just brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  The salsas (both red and green) were easily the highlight of the visit.  I may go back just to buy the salsa.  The chile relleno wasn't bad, but the rice was clearly yesterday's leftovers and the beans had a funky vinegar taste.  The sopapillas were also not what I was  expecting.  It wasn't bad food, but it certainly wasn't the best ever, either.  The decor was cute and fun."
2,"Terrible customer service, I went to ask them why my bill has not arrived yet and they told me you're behind on your payment,  when I asked how can I pay without getting a bill, I was told you should know when you need to pay, even on your very first bill. The lady at the desk was no help at all and was blaming me for not getting my bill. I will never go back to any of there store or ever recommend anyone I know to go to any of there stores. If I could give them less than one star I would....\n\nAfter posting the review above I got a call from the GM of the store apologising for what had happened and tried to fix it, because of that I gave the store 3 stars instead of the 1 star I had put up 2 days before."
4,"This review is mainly for your fantastic bartender:  Katie.  We attended a party here on Friday evening and she really kept the attention and service at a level few bartenders are capable of achieving.\n\nShe was fast, engaging and professional.  We will return the next time we are in town."
4,"When you're drunk and don't want to walk, this is a good option.  Sit down, relax and enjoy the ride and the billion dollar views.  At least you know you won't be getting ripped off by a sly taxi driver."
0,"Lights are the most dangerous thing.\n\nAt 3am they come on.   Usually this is quite inopportune.\n\nIllumination is like douchebag kryptonite.    \n\nIt draws them out of this dark room.  Their Affliction T-shirts shining in the sparkly phosphorescence of the hotel lobby.     Some sulk into the elevator alcove.   \n\nYou're not going to this bar because you're at the cutting edge of cool,  you're here because you absolutely require the dark spaces and tourist intoxication that will allow you to practice your Douchy Arts.   \n\nYou may be in the W, but you're a total L."
2,For airport food you can't go wrong with chili's! Limited menu but good selections. Good place to pass the time while waiting at the airport which lets face it is always a drag. Mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.
2,"Great pizza. Staff was awesome upon first visit. Very attentive and awesome during lunch of 7/17/14!! However.. My mother came to visit me this past Sunday (07/17/14) and I decided to take her, my boyfriend, and little brother to eat here. The tall brunette at the front counter (2pm-ish) wasn't helpful. She was very impatient and made us feel uncomfortable and rushed as we were reviewing the menu and no one offered to refill our drinks the entire time. The pizza tastes awesome! Overall it was great the first time, second time not so much."
4,"Whenever I visit Vegas (once or twice a year) I always intend on coming to Earl for their sandwich but never do because of their ridiculous line. So after this past Vegas trip for spring break with the girls we ended up staying at Planet Hollywood for a week.\n\nLet me just say that for a week of staying here, me and my girlfriend ate here 5x in a row and made sure to buy 3 sandwiches before we headed back home to Hawaii. I've only tried the tuna melt because everything else sounded delicious but it contained meat in them (I'm a pescinarian). For about $7.00 a sandwich which is a huge and incredibly delicious sandwich it'll leave you tummy full, your mouth happy and you wanting and craving for more. \n\nI like that the workers are very fast in making the sandwiches, they line does look long but it moves pretty fast. They do have a small dining area but we only did takeout so we could bring it back upstairs to our room. I like the fact that they only use one type of bread which is good so it doesn't leave you with thoughts of \""what bread should I get\"" \""Will this bread be good\"". It's perfectly toasted to perfection and the tuna and Swiss cheese just blends so well in the sandwich...*so simple but good*. \n\nFriends tried the breakfast sandwich and he said it was yummy and another friend tried the American and she said it was perfect! But she still liked the tuna melt the best. Now I know when I'm in Vegas, EARL of sandwich is a MUUST go to especially because they are always open."
3,There's nothing like a cool treat on a hot day when you're feeling all jet-laggy!  M-m-m-m-m-m...mint chocolate chip Italian ice!
3,"I'm glad there's a new owner in this establishment because the last one was awful. We got the house rolls with spinach and feta and they were sooooo good! Then there was the extreme meat pizza, don't know if that's the exact name but everyone loved it. I got a veggie which was just ok. Had no really great flavor. Next time I want to try a different veggie one, they had 2. I will deffinatly go back and try more of the rolls. The menu was pretty big and I'd like to try a lot of different things they have."
2,I really really really wanted to love this place.\n\nAlmost all Asian customers.  The waitress was the nicest waitress I have ever encountered.  \n\nI had the eggplant and potatoes with jalapeno.  Only I asked for just a tiny bit of jalapenos because I am a wimp.  The waitress misunderstood our discussion and substituted green pepper for the jalapeno and I don't like green pepper.  The food was super greasy and almost flavorless.  :(\n\nWon't be back.
3,"Well if you like gay bars and live in North Phoenix, here's your place! Rainbow Cactus has been Marly's (sp) and Taylor's Tavern prior. It's a bit divey. It REALLY needs some new carpet, bathrooms, and patio furniture, but hey we are in a recession, so I get it! They have a huge drink selection that is averagely priced. Darts, pool, skillcrane, an ATM, and a jukebox. The staff is always nice! They used to be cash only but now take debit and possibly credit cards I do believe. It's in a creepy complex with a Taxadermy shop and doesn't open until 3pm. Mainly regulars are here and it's typically kind of slow unless they have a drag show or karaoke. It's a eclectic little place for sure. There is only one toilet per sex (which isn't enforced) and the bathrooms are in big need of some updating. They do keep them clean, though. The back \""patio\"" is rickety, has an odd jumble of old furniture and you can't drink out there. I think the new ownership by Karen has helped the bring some life back into this place! Now if it could just make enough dough for some updates! \nThey serve some snacks like bags of chips, but you can bring in your own food and there is a pizza place next door that will bring food over as well.\nThis is a fun, neighborhood gay and \""gay friendly\"" bar that just seems to vary each time I come. You never know what might be going on! Props to keeping events and shows going and being the only gay bar in the area!"
4,two words: CASEY COMBS!!!  He HOOKED US UP!  We went for my nephew's 21st bday.  Got an awesome price for table service and an optimal spot!!!  Bottle pricing was reasonable and the music was pretty good.  The best part was the service!  He was patient as I tried to gather my party of mostly under 25 year olds and really just treated us well.  The staff was patient and friendly.  LOVE IT!!!!
3,My co-worker and I had a great lunch at the Steelhead today.  I got the Light & Simple 1/2 Turkey BLT and 1/2 Garden Vegetable Salad meal.  The Turkey BLT was excellent.  The turkey was fresh and plentiful.  The bacon was perfect and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  My 1/2 garden vegetable salad was very good.  The Champagne Vinaigrette dressing was perfect.  I highly recommend trying this place if you are in Downtown Pittsburgh.  The only thing is that they are a little pricey.
2,"Was super excited to see chicken and waffles on the menu and enthusiastically ordered them along with a breakfast poutine. When the chicken and waffles arrived, I was impressed to see a homemade BBQ sauce and maple syrup on the plate. Unfortunately, the chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it :/ The breakfast poutine on the other hand was fantastic! My stomach hated me for eating something that rich, but the b\u00e9chamel sauce was so good I ended up wiping the bowl clean with the potatoes from my chicken and waffles plate!"
4,"Saw the movie - not that impressed. Went to the play and it was great!   So much fun and good music (yes, a throw back in time but enjoyable).   This play script is definitely made for the plays and not for a poor Tom Cruise movie....\n\nWhen we arrived, we were upgraded for no charge - we got a nice center seat (i.e. good place to see the show).  We then ordered two beers to enjoy during the show.  If you do not want to stand in the long line they have at the bar, they have people walking around to sell various drinks and we just ordered our beers from our seat.   \n\nHighly recommend this show (Note: We are from California so we enjoyed this show more than Jersey Boys which we saw a couple of nights earlier.)  Both shows are good but we really enjoyed Rock of Ages.\n\nThey give you little lights to wave at various parts of the show -some got into it; some did not."
2,"Truly an adult show. Not for people who are uncomfortable about sex and sex topics. Don't seat near the stage because you may get called on. Just remember it's all in good fun (we did see a wife extremely upset and leave the show...it was not her husband's fault, you can't control what a person in the audience does especially if they are very drunk). I thought this show was tastefully done. Favorite part was the fish bowl, lady with hula-hoops, the madem was funny, witty, and entertaining. The comic relief group in between acts were very funny and interacted with the audience."
3,"I have used thie t-shirt diner a few times now and I must say I am a fan.  As a small business owner, I often want to make a few small runs of shirts, etc for my staff or for promotional purposes.  Trying to find a printer can be time consuming and costly, especially for small runs of an item.  Sizing and colors and everything you want to change from one item to the next incurs a large fee with printers.\n\nThe T-shirt Diner is the easy way to get s few items done quickly and cost effectively.  You can get most things done in the same day, even while you are shopping in the mall.  (come back in an hour and it's done)\n\nThe last time I used them, there was a small issue with my items not being ready when promised.  I waited a few hours in the mall and they were eventually done.  With the rush of getting them done, I noticed when I got home that there were some defects with some of the vinyl logos they had applied. I took them back a few days later and they appologized and fixed them for me at no extra charge.  This was very nice to see.\n\nYou can even bring in your own clothing for them to print on!\n\nI highly recommend them for your printing needs."
3,"Snooze is my new favorite breakfast place! Lots of healthy choices for every liking. Gluten free, dairy free, vegan. A little pricey, but the service and quality are awesome!"
2,"This location has two major problems; the menu is drastically limited and the prices are higher than their other stores off Strip. \n\nI normally like the Berry Upbeet, but this is not an option here. Instead I got the Five Fruit Frenzy with Immunity and it was on par with the other locations. Reading some of these reviews leads to me wonder why my friends Strawberry Whirl with Whey Protein tasted so bad. For the most part, I am fine with \""healthy tasting\"" foods, but this was not bearable. \n\nThe employees were all friendly, but are trained to push extra snacks. I can see them getting backed up during peak hours, so a little patience will go a long way. I tend to go elsewhere when the line snakes around."
1,"Disappointed, went here for a birthday luncheon & although the hostess was not rude, she was not welcoming.  The food was very disappointing, had the seafood trio from the specialty menu, was dry, flavorless & veggies were oily - presentation looked nothing like the picture on the menu.  The looks of my friend's salad she ordered was not appetizing looking.  Service was good, but not outstanding, Server did not offer a birthday dessert or even a candle on the desserts that were ordered for the birthday person.  Lack luster - will not frequent this place."
2,"this lounge was ok. We was in vegas for superbowl weekend, and we stayed at the Rio. And decided to try their lounge.. it was ok. Music was ok.. That's all I really can say about it.. Just ok.."
1,Long wait for small simple takeout order. Marinara sauce had lots of meat in it which is not good for vegetarians. Also forgot to include breadstick.
1,"Like they say, you can put lipstick on a pig...but its still a pig. The food and the service are NOT what I expect from this beautifully decorated restaurant. I would have been better off at Caraba's. \n\nI've been to Brio about 3 times now. The 3rd (and likely last) time was a recent Sunday for brunch. There were 7 adults and 4 children. Our server seemed disorganized from the time she took our order to the time we had to hunt her down thru a passing server to ASK for the check.  \n\nOur entrees came out in batches. Some at my table were eating 3-4 minutes before my food arrived. I expected all the food to come out at the same time...even if that meant our server had assistance. To top it off, my food was cold. My salad that I ordered for appetizer was over dressed and the lettuce wilted. \n\nWhen a woman in my party asked for water, the server only brought ONE water. She didn't ask anyone else at the table if they'd like water also. When the server brought the single water, she made it a point to say \""we don't automatically serve water\"". I know we have a water shortage in AZ, but damn! At least ask! \n\nOnly the kids and the 2 adults who ordered French Toast seemed pleased w/ their food. 2 of the kids probably don't count, as they are 1.5 years old! These growing boys were just happy to be eating! \n\nFantastic food can make bad service bearable. Outstanding service & presentation can make \""OK\"" food great. But mediocre service AND food call for a 3 strikes and you're out in my eyes."
1,"There was a massive cochroach in our room. Super gross!! The bar lounge waitress's would not even come over to me or speak to me.  The gym, pool, & spa were nice but having dinner here is more like business than vacay time.  I will never stay here again. Not fun or stress free resort....."
1,"The restaurant was super empty, which, to me, says a lot.  I ordered Pad Thai (I always order Pad Thai, no matter which Thai restaurant we're eating at) and I found it to be pretty bland and not spicy at all.  I thought Thai food is supposed to have some spice in it?  Anyway, the waitress never asked if I wanted it spicy, so I just assumed it will be spicy in the end.  I guess that's my fault.  But my fiance ordered BBQ chicken on skewers and it was bland as well.  Needless to say, I've had much better Thai food.  It's safe to say we won't be coming back.  On the upside of things, the service here is good, the workers are friendly."
2,"Very friendly , laid back atmosphere.  The building shows wear and tear but overall very clean. Food is simply described on the menu and they have plenty of sides to choose from!!! I ordered my NY steak sandwich medium rare, but unfortunately it was very well done. Service was nice and you can tell the teamwork makes it all happen. All in all , I would come back for the service , but the food needs a little work."
0,"For as often as I shop at this store you would think they would remember me, or I would learn a lesson. Every single time I go to purchase something the pricing changes. When you call then go into the store its the same thing. I really think they just make a majority of the pricing up off the top of their heads regardless of the stickers. I called to see if they carried a particular item and the guy told me over the phone one price and said \"" yeah, come on down and we can give you a discount too.\"" When I got there it was a completely different price, more and guess what? No discount. Imagine that. I think from now on I will just take my business someplace else because that isn't a good way to run a business, let alone keep your customers happy. Another thing that might also help with that whole \""customer service\"" aspect is actually being knowledgable on the products the store sells. Yeah I get theres quite a bit of stuff in that store but theres always a group of guys working. I'm sure someone knows something they can teach the others. C'mon guys, I don't like leaving bad reviews about places I normally shop from but this is just getting old."
1,Nice service people but agents are rude and not upfront with you about the charges. Want use them again
2,"For me, Falbo's has always been a trip down memory lane.  During my time at UW Falbo's was always the late-night pizza of choice for my roommates and me.  When I was a freshman I remember walking to their old University Avenue location to grab a slice for lunch.  As I continued my storied and distinguished college career I always seemed to be in proximity to Falbo's.  For two years I lived a block away from the Park Street location.  There were plenty of nights where I'd come home at bar time to find my roommates playing PS2.  They'd call in an order and then give the money.  I'd go pick it up so as to not disturb their video game.  Our arrangement was great, and I don't think I paid for pizza more than a couple times over those years.  Fast forward a few years: I'm out of college and working for a living.  There are no more bar time nights or roommates, well at least no roommates.  I've even moved out to the suburbs.  But imagine my surprise when I realize that there is an outpost of college nostalgia in Middleton - a Falbo's not much  more than five minutes down the road.  \n\nI was first clued into this shocking development a couple months into my first apartment in Middleton.  A friend from college was in town and couch surfing at my place for a week, and after one Thursday night at the Boar we stumbled back to my place and he wanted to order a pizza.  I told him that I didn't know of much in the area, just a Domino's and Buck's, but I improvised and grabbed a phonebook from the pile in the lobby.  I didn't believe it at first, but the Falbo's guy confirmed that they were in fact located in Middleton, at 12 & Century.  Thirty minutes later we had our pizza and it was great.\n\nFalbo's pizza is the gold standard for what I consider \""college pizza\"" - thin crust pepperoni & cheese, delivery late into the night.  My tastes have grown since college and I prefer the specialty pizzas at Roman Candle and Picasso's to the old pepperoni & cheese standard, but it's hard to go wrong with the delicious simplicity of a well-made pie.  The best aspects of Falbo's are the thin crust and the cheese.  The pizza is never too greasy or soggy.  Over the last few years I don't believe I've ever ordered anything but that old college standard, pepperoni & cheese, and although I know they've got a big menu I've never really delved into it.  If I ordered delivery more often then I'd probably know more about what they have, but almost every situation has been one where a friend is coming over or is staying and I want to order something quick and simple.  Falbo's is perfect for this, and if I've got the time I can run over there for pick-up and save a couple of minutes.  I don't think Falbo's is the best pizza in Middleton - I like Roman Candle for this.  But Falbo's is the best for quick and fast delivery, and for me recalls some of favorite memories of my college years."
1,"Hmm......Overcrowded....Authentic and true ravers are the minority.  Very rude festival goers who do so many drugs they can't see straight and they 'knock' and walk into you, even when you are on crutches with a sprained ankle.  They will yell at you and demand to get out of their way, often putting my crutch on a piece of trash and falling over, even better for a sprained ankle.\n\nPasquale seems to have stopped caring about the ravers and their experience and cares more about the masses, whoever he can get to go to his event and his pocket.  Not cool Pasquale, I used to rave with you in the early 1990s in Los Angeles.  \n\nThis by far was the worst electronic music event and festival I have ever gone to in twenty two years!\n\nGeneral admission bathrooms were DISGUSTING!  Toilet paper was not restocked all three days of going.  I started bringing toilet paper from my hotel room to wipe when I needed to at the event.  Water and hand sanitizer were always out, after you just been in a porta potty with no toilet paper, great for hygiene.  The bathrooms were so disgusting that I took off my side bag, my tutu and camelbak off prior to entering and left my mate to hold all my girlie possessions.  If you are paying for $400-$750 for a ticket, the least you can do is offer clean bathrooms and replace water and hand sanitizer, how do you expect your festival goers and ravers to stay clean?  You surely don't allow us to bring in hand sanitizer.\n\nDay 1......Festival was pretty cool, bathrooms were disgusting.  Rude people.  Lots of ODs, I started to become desensitized to them, which is really sad.  I asked where the taxis were at the INFORMATION BOOTH.  The stupid woman sent us out the wrong way, where we 1) was not the shuttle pick up (we had shuttle bands) 2) the taxis were not able to pick us up 3) we were at the parking lot and we didn't drive 4) they refused us to go back in so we could exit correctly, they only would allow me to go back in because I had a VIP band and my carer was General Admission and (I am on crutches).  The cops had blocked off all the street corners, we tried getting to all of them, we just got turned away, they closed the streets down because drum roll, some idiot went to his car, did a whole bunch of drugs, OD and died.  Dude died in EDC parking lot.  My friend and I walked around for 2 hours, now getting dehydrated couldn't get to the shuttle because they wouldn't let us, couldn't get to the taxi because the streets were closed down, and we went through 4 bottles of water we brought out with us to stay hydrated.  It is now pushing 6am, the sun it hot, we left at 4am to try to get back to our hotel.  Are you trying to create another death?  I had to hitch hike 5 different times before some nice ravers felt sorry for us and took us back to our hotel.  Pasquale that should have never happened!  They finally ended up opening up a closed pathway because they realized more people were getting stuck and they did not want another death on their hands.\n\nDay 2......Pretty cool lots of authentic ravers were about, disgusting bathrooms once again....went out the correct way and got on the shuttle\n\nDay 3.....Oh this is the day we should have stayed home!  We had drugged out cranky drug addicts up now for 72 hours being gigantic jerks, screaming at one another to move out of the way, every one had a miserable look on their face.\n\nThe moral of the story, people go to do large amounts of drugs.  The rave culture is completely lost here.  Those dancing are the minority.  No one wears kandi anymore.  So many new people in the scene they have no idea what they are doing in the scene.  They have no idea why they are standing in front of a DJ.  \n\nLots of drug busts, 72 felony arrests.  Police and security guards dressed as undercover ravers, busted busted busted.  Good for them, maybe they will get some money thrown into their pockets.\n\nThis was a huge waste of $7,000 because that is what it cost me for 2 shuttle passes $180 + tax, a VIP pass at $700, flight was $2,000 and hotel was $1,000 among other incidentals, I much rather stay in my happy home in the United Kingdom.  \n\nNext year they are talking about doing a two weekend EDC LV, what a huge cluster insert cuss word here that would be.\n\nMany people have said this, \""EDC is not a place for real ravers\"".\n\nI've had raver friends come three years in a row, they said this was the worst EDC in their life, they will never go again.  I am sure they will write some reviews as well.\n\nThe people who are rating EDC as 5 stars did a ton of drugs, just look at the pictures they posted, drugs consisting of either acid or more then 2 pills of MDMA, yeah it will be paradise if you are that off your rocker but for a person who did not do drugs and drank Gentleman's Jack all night on ice (thank you for serving that btw), it was complete madness and you saw EVERYTHING that was going on.\n\nI was asked by Ground Patrol to help out and save lives, I did, I prevented 15+ ODs."
0,"I have been a regular at China Chili for over 10 years. Sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd Street and Flower their quality has been deteriorating.  \n\nWent recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard.  The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.\n\nI think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.\n\nNot sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality."
0,"Went for my sisters bday, we parked in the empty lot infront of the club where everyone parked must have been 50 cars in the lot and got a 288$ ticket. We posted on downtown's website about it and they said that Club Downtown doesn't have a parking lot and it was our fault parking there. Total jerks. Didnt even care. The lot had no signs that we couldnt park there and we assumed it was there parking from all the cars parked infront of the club!"
4,"What can i say...i am a believer...i had heard about this sushi joint but i don't think any of the accounts i heard did it justice.\n\nI am a true fan of authentic Japanse food and sushi but the chefs here put a twist to all your favorites...its like your fantasy sushi and roll combinations coming true.\n\nI had the Triple X roll ,Mistake roll ,Kimchii roll, and Orgasm roll and i put them down in order of preference. The Triple X is most definitely the best roll i have had since i was put on God's green earth.\n\nI don't think the pictures i took came out right, but then again my saliva glands and my mouth was on a trip so i cant blame my hands for wanting to drop the phone and get back to feasting.\n\nHad a few Sake bombs and yet the bill wasn't ridiculous at all. I know its not on the Vegas strip but i highly recommend you take the detour."
0,Customer service was pretty rotten. Almost all the staff were rude and impatient and the whole experience was generally unpleasant. I won't fly this airline again-not voluntarily.
1,"Really slow service..... I ordered breakfast carry out while passing through town.  Not only did my order take long, it sat on a shelf behind the counter until I got up and asked if that was my order.  It's not like they were busy and the staff was overworked.  There were 3 young employees having a sidebar conversation about school during my wait.  None of them were attentive or seemed concerned that I was standing there for 17 minutes.  No wonder the nearby McDonalds with their reheated food menu has higher ratings than this place."
4,"I have been craving for Korean Oxtail Soup since I arrived in Las Vegas last Friday. I tried last night but this restaurant closes at 9pm Saturdays. After church today, this is my only destination. My family of 5 ordered 2 Oxtail Soup and 3 Ox Tounge but had to order extra ox tounge because they are all so good and delicious. I love the extras on the side such as Kimchi, spices and sauces so I can customize the soup to my own taste. Service was friendly and fast. A new favorite place in Vegas so will definitely come back and will being along friends and family."
4,"I usually will not update my reviews unless I experience something that is Yelp worthy. Kan Pai changed their menu since the last time I was here and they now have Kalbi! The Kalbi meal was around $10.00 and it came with salad, soup, Kalbi and rice. It was so good and surprisingly so was the salad. The dressing isn't the usual ginger dressing that you find at most of these places. It tasted like they added some orange zest to it.... that really made the salad for me. I had the deep fried California Rolls which was good. My husband and I also really enjoyed the fried banana with ice cream dessert. I'm not into raw fish but I saw this table get some sort of raw fish platter and they made it look like a Bonsai tree.....it was pretty cool!"
3,"This experience has virgin all over it.  The first time for real indian food. The first time at India Palace.  I can say that the it was extremely pleasant. The food was very good. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium spice). There was no hint of HOT, but the chicken was smokey and the sauce was delicious.  My husband ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh (medium spice). Again, not HOT, but delicious. We ordered the Aloo Tikki, a side of Peas Pulao and Garlic Naan.  We left no crumbs behind.  I will add, the hotest food I had that night was one of the three suaces that came with the flat bread.\n\nThe atmosphere was just right for my husband and I out for date night.  They had recently (within the last two years) renovated the place and it was nice. The neighborhood is in an older part of town, but close enough to the strip.\n\nAlthough I have nothing to compare this too, I felt the need to express our satisfaction and desire to try the cuisine again and again."
0,"I got my tattoo done here about a month ago. Today, I went to get my tattoo retouched. It wasn't a major job, just covering some small spots here and there. I made an appointment for noon by their suggestion. However, when I arrived there, I waited half an hour for my guy, Jose, to show up. Then Nick came and told me he doesn't know if Jose would even come, but I already made an appointment! I asked if someone else could retouch my tattoo instead. Nick then told me that I could come in at 4 later in the afternoon because no artist was available at the time. But when I looked around, no artist was working on anyone else's tattoo! And why would I come at a later time when I already made an appointment? I wasted too much time for a simple retouch job. All they could tell me was a half-hearted \""Sorry.\"" Such bad service and poor organization is not worth the expensive price of my tattoo, which was a simple line and filling design. I first came here because I have been told that this is the best tattoo shop in town. After today's incident, I am incredibly disappointed. They don't care about the customer's time or satisfaction. Apparently, an appointment means nothing.  \n\nIf you want to get your first tattoo, I absolutely suggest you look elsewhere. Bad price for bad service. Spend your money wisely. There are better shops in town. I don't plan on coming back."
0,"I just left this place. It is a neat idea in concept- play area with booze and food, but omg, what a clusterfun. You really would need someone to go with you to explain how things work. This not my idea of relaxing. \n\nThe appetizers I had were actually pretty tasty- the pretzel bread was nice. However, I got super grossed out by the hair that was in my margarita. That coupled with the whole, not having a server thing, really kills the idea of ever going back to this \""restaurant\""."
3,"Good Chicken club, fries were hot... just couldnt understand person on intercom clearly..over all it was OK"
4,"Dr. McCarthy is one of the best physicians I have ever had the privilege of meeting, being a patient of and working with.  I have never felt better then I feel now and Dr. McCarthy is the reason.  His knowledge, experience and wiliness to listen is commendable.  I refer patients to him all the time and they all come back to report that he is awesome.

0,Rancid Egg White/Feta burrito! No refund because I threw it away and wasn't willing to trash dive for it. BAD NEWS!
2,"okay, so you should go to the jade garden if you like buffets. its also good if you like vegetables, not because there is a stunning variety of meatless items, but because the green beans they make are SO good. also the broccoli in the chicken and broccoli is really good. there's probably a lot of garlic in there. \n\nusually when i go to the jade garden, i try to balance out the amount of fried stuff on my plate with green stuff. so in addition to the broccoli and green beans, i like an egg roll, some scallion pancakes, and maybe some noodles.\n\nthere's definitely that token dessert counter, complete with the funny pudding with nilla wafers or bananas, green jello squares, some kind of cookies, little pieces of cake that remind of of gelatin for some reason, and tapioca. i would skip this area altogether if i were you. end on a savory note. grab an extra scallion pancake. its worth it."
4,"Actually 4+ stars.  Having read some of the other reviews it seems the reviews are some what varied.  My husband is a platinum elite member and as such we may have had a different/better experience...but shouldn't.  In summary:\n\n-Clean rooms (we were upgraded to a huge suite with two full baths, jacuzzi, and a lovely patio.  Highly recommend 1st floor rooms with patios.\n-Great scale compared to the oversized hotels on the strip.\n-Great location: North West Las Vegas.\n-Great spa.\n-Elegant ambiance.\n-Delicious fresh bagels and pile of lox, with Mimosa's via room service...served on the patio.\n-Easy access casino onsite... We did well at the bar.\n-Service was excellent.  They even sent a team of staff, immediately, when we could not find the TV remote.\n\n-On site restaurants leave one wanting, but it's an easy drive to downtown and the strip.  Hence 4+ stars."
3,My friends and had dinner here before our movie that AMC in the same complex and the food was phenomenal! It was kinda dead due to the odd time of day we visited but the service was awesome. I wish I could remember our servers name but she really seemed to know a lot about the dishes and care about her job. We partook in the $4.95 mojitos which were yummy too! \n\nPS: We used a restaurant.com coupon too! :)
0,"Super expensive..  Nothing special about this \""circus circus\"" location, if you are used to Subway. Giving one star due to the $$$$, holy cow, highway robbery, just wrong.!!!!  $29 for 2-foot longs, 1-six inch and a drink..."
3,"The kind of Thai food you want in the neighborhood. Well spiced, with each dish having distinct flavors. Not dumbed down. The kind of place to take your friends who know and like Thai food.\n\n4-stars, since we've only been once (which will be remedied soon, I'm sure)."
1,"We stopped by and though we have not had a reservation a friendly maitre, promptly seated us. The food is truly delicious. Incredible cocktails, fresh bread and most importantly the dishes, executed impeccably. Our duck was delicious. Scallops though only 3 of them on the plate, were really good. The soup , the salad tasted fresh, prepared and presented really nice. Dessert and foie gras reminded us that we are indeed in Montreal.\nThe service on the other hand was a total disaster. Our waitress did not bother to explain menu to us at all. After she took our orders, she disappeared completely. Even though my wife mentioned that we would like some wine with our main courses, she did not even bothered for once to stop by and ask if we like our food or if we need anything. She was running around like maniac without stopping. I guess she just did not like us. This restaurant serves souffles. Is does require 18 minutes of wait and in our humble experience, in restaurants that do serve souffle, waiters tell about it, so people can preorder instead of waiting, especially with two tired children. So no souffle for us. No questions about after dinner drinks. One would think that if tip is calculated based on the check, the waiter would at least try to offer some options even if not make our experience more pleasant but to make the  tip bigger. I guess that waiter was working for fun.\nWe really enjoyed our food. It was great and the chef should be  kissed nightly. But if you take a great picture and hang it on the meat hooks instead of the frame, the perception is really mixed."
0,"Last month, my GF talked me into going to Derby Public House because they had a special -- with a bingo-type card you got two free drinks. They advertised the card as costing $20 for two, so we got two. Unbeknownst to us, each card had two bingo cards on it so I was surprised when the bill came and the cards cost me $40. Not only that, but the prizes for winning the game were cheesy, like a beer cooler. I wrote a letter to the GM of the Derby Public House complaining that the bingo card game was misleading. He didn't even have the courtesy to call me back."
1,"The food was bland, and sometime tasteless. I went there a couple of time to check on both lunch and dinner but left unsatisfied. \n\nThe sushi was mediocre and the crab wasn't that fresh. \n\nGo some place else yelpers."
2,"Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n9 Food\n8 *Drinks*\n5 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n8 Value\n\nThe food & drink here is excellent.  The atmosphere is pretty cool too.\n\nThe pretzel buns on their burgers and sandwiches are awesome.  The cheesy sauce is awesome.  The coconut covered chicken with the citrus ginger honey sauce is awesome.  The drinks are pretty awesome, though they could use just ever so sliiiightly heavier pours.\n\nBut the execution is, so far, way WAY on the side of lack.\n\nThey offer exactly the same type of brunchy mimosa pitcherness as Maize's, but for $10 instead of $15.  This is good.  But, you get wine glasses instead of champagne glasses, and there's no bucket of ice to keep the champagne chilled in.  Hot champagne is not good champagne.  And this might just be me, but you get easily thrice as much orange juice as you'll ever need, and I hate thoughtless waste.\n\nThe menu is too small.  I don't mean that in the sense that there aren't enough offerings; i mean that in the sense that they don't describe their offerings well enough.  If i was a big time vegetarian, which is something you need to cater to in CenPho, I would have been pretty pissed that there were greasy (and delicious) strips of bacon hugging the side of my french toast this morning - the menu says nothing about bacon.  I also didn't know what was coming with my burger.  I assumed it was fries.  Instead it was coleslaw.  The coleslaw was delicious, but it pretty much seems like the physical menus were an afterthought creation a half hour before open.  Did you know the burger came on a pretzel bun?  I didn't either until it showed up.  Good thing the pretzel bun's good.\n\nThe service is extremely nice, but slow and poorly timed.  This isn't just my opinion.  This has also been the opinion of the 6 other people that I've been here with over a few visits in addition to opinions from others that have been (on visits where I wasn't there).  I'm hoping this will shape up as the staff gains more experience, since I guess this place has only been open a month.\n\nEverything here is fixable, so I really hope Bliss/reBAR survives their shitty location long enough to work out all these kinks, because deep down (and on the surface of my tongue) I really like it."
0,"Dont buy into the hype. The service at this place is terrible. Waiters barely even talk to you. like \""hey, what do you want?\"" they really give you the f- off vibe. food is way overhyped and expensive. Really the worst place i have been to in awhile. Seriously, stay away. Also i dont think waiting 20 minutes for a check and then another 10 to get my credit card back is very reasonble, especially when they are not that busy. Thanks botchi burger. ill spell the name right when you get it right."
1,"Went for their buffet last week, and sadly didn't have any sort of memorable experience. The most impressive dishes were the potato cauliflower dish, and the drink. Naan was boring, spiciness of the meat dishes lacked flavor to make them complex. Perhaps it is just that I have been spoiled by the amazing Indian food I have had elsewhere, but this just did not stack up. \n\nTo be fair, I have never ordered off this restaurant's menu, so perhaps their cooked to order fare is more impressive, but the lunch buffet was just not doing it for me. \n\nPrice was reasonable, so at least there was no sticker shock to add insult to injury."
0,"Wish I could give zero stars! I found this place on yelp so and my husband and I decided this would be our first stop on our way in to Vegas (we wanted to catch Sunday football). I looked this place up (rira.com) found they have $4 carlsberg pints all day as well as football food specials. \n\nWalked up and WE had to greet the girls at the wait stand (they literally just stood their and said nothing). We asked to sit in the bar. \n\nGirl behind the bar acted very annoyed that I asked about the beer special and pretended like she knew nothing about it. She asked another bartender and he said \""I think carlsberg is the special\"". Then when I asked about the football food specials she told me \""oh, that was only during the first year we were open\"". I said well your website is definitely not up to date then. At that point she gave our \""table\"" to another bar tender. We left. As you can see their website still has all the specials listed. Waste of time!"

3,"My friend and I were aimlessly driving around looking for a place for happy hour. Luckily, we came across this gem. The happy hour prices were amazing---you could get an appetizer for a mere $2 when you ordered a drink. I ordered the Mai Thai for $2.95. What a steal! I also ordered the Singapore noodles, which were mouth-watering. My friend enjoyed the half-off sushi deals and the sake bombs. I definitely plan on coming back here next time I'm in town!"
4,"First trip out to AZ! Got a groupon deal for 3 nights! Really nice place in Scottsdale, didn't know it was a timeshare at first! Staff super nice, concierge really helpful! I had a really fun time exploring scottsdale and phoenix! Would love to stay here again! We stayed in the one bedroom suite complete with a kitchen! Pool was undergoing renovations but we went to wet n wild anyway!"
3,"This is not closed. \n\nBF has been here before and decided on a whim to come in after discussing glasses the night prior. Impulse buy glasses, whaddya know. He needed them though. \n\nThey have a pretty good selection of brands and shapes and got him in even though he was a  Saturday afternoon walk in bit before closing.\n\nGlasses were ready in a week and a half. My guy is sexier in plastic frames. I'm a happy camper."
3,"I'm not a big fan of Chinese food but my family is, so I thought I would give it a try. I was very impressed, the food is perfectly and seasoned just right. The beef and broccoli was amazing and the rice was just right. I will be back and to try more things off the menu."
0,Worst customer service/ tech support phone system. I called 4 times and got dropped or cut off after being put on hold. Recording tried to upswell me on things I already subscribed too. Very frustrated!  Never could get to tech support to address my problem. Wasted 40 mins of my day and no resolution.
0,"I hope for the sake of a tiny minority of decent employees that the telephone \""customer service\"" of wells fargo dealer services is outsourced to a third party. still, their fault for not  properly monitoring   This outfit stinks of a low budget bookkeeping telemarketing operation, the kind I worked for in the early 90s that we all vs up to work for one Monday morning to find the doors locked, the desks and phones gone, and so was our paychecks for work already done. \nThe employees on the phones, processing payments, supervisors, managers, ALL have trouble understanding that the customer I s why they even have as job. I had payments applied to incorrect accounts which I sent on time, but   instead of applying to correct account, they sent back to me as a check, with no explanation or warning about the teal account showing the payments now as late. They never fixed my record of 100% ontime payments to reflect that's what happened. They took a payment out of my hank account unauthorized then refused to refund it even when the other bank manager called them. while hole they showed it as late, their phone reps called and insulted me  saying I couldn't do the math necessary to realize how being late affected my loan, actually saying this, not simply implying  it. When attempting to speak to a supervisor or manager, it became obvious the prior phone reps had misrepresented me in their notes, so the manager began talking down to me in a terrible way, saying that the phone reps yelling at me and cutting me off were behaving appropriately and I was just mad because I hadn't paid my bill and didn't like that a collector was calling me.. The pattern of talking over my sentences while trying to explain my problem with the phone reps was now clear - it is under the guide of their terrible management that these crooked shysters are lying in their notes that a customer is not cooperative whole they aren't even listening to what the customer is trying to say, and they just put whatever they want I  the notes and try to billy people into kayo g when the account is merely one payment late. yep, only in 30 day status, the due date that would make it 60 day status hasn't even come around, and this manager threatened that he was just going to have the car repo'd ! what a joke this Butthole was, since he obviously does not know a customer of 5 years with a perfect history that is about to pay off a loan is not going to get repo'd, and in fact is likely to buy a new car soon and therefore a valuable resource of potential future revenue for the bank. and they are accusing me of not being able to do the math?!?   I think maybe the entire boiler room might be either high or simply stupid. Unfugginbelievable . Time for spy techniques to uncover corporate phone numbers and get this info into the ears of someone higher up up who understands what a customer like me means to a bank smart enough to care."
4,"Amazing food, service, ambiance, as well as gluten free knowledge and options. Highly recommend! I will likely become a regular!"
0,First impression says a lot....Employee cooking food that was located right by the door wasn't what you call customer friendly. Then I asked her about one of their products and she says I don't know. If you work there you should know! Not \ntoo thrilled. I didn't buy anything from there either. Their onion rings looked good on a customers plate thought! I'd rather go to Penn Station!
2,"I have to come here once every several months because I have an out of town guest that comes in and this is his favorite place to go. I think their food is good. My burgers have always been good always prepared to order, & I love their bottomless fries.  But nothing is really spectacular. However, I think they are way overpriced. Service is usually  slow, and the food usually takes a very long time to arrive. If it wasn't for my friend coming into town. I would never go back.  I much prefer five guys. Even though this restaurant is a tiny bit more upscale than five guys."
1,"This is probably one of the most disappointing meals we've had from a chef of this high caliber.\n\nPerhaps because the restaurant is newly opened and the menu hasn't been perfected (well, that is still no excuse for overcooking beef)?\n\nUnlike the other low rating reviewer - service was really good for us. ambiance and table seating and arrangement was also not an issue. The only problem we had was entirely on the food.\n\nI like the different tasting dishes but some times it felt really disjointed and confused, as if it lacked something to tie all the small dishes together.  \n\nThe langoustine tasting was quite fun and interesting. While some of the dishes were  amazing, others were like, huh? And the sake shot? I was like..hum...not sure why they are doing a shot of sake when they just sold us a bottle of really expensive wine...didn't really enhance the langoustine or the overall tasting experience. \n\nMy husband's steak was overdone. He ordered rare, and the beef came out barely pink. We didn't want to send it back and just decided to concentrate on my venison which was prob one of the best I have ever had. \n\nThe dessert tasting was fun and exciting. It was like a flirtatious girl all dressed up ready for a night on the town. Lots of \""bling\"" and once again, many of the components didn't really make sense all together.\n\nThis sounds really silly, but the warm baguette served before our meal was awesome (not baked in-house...but super tasty)!\n\nI was really hoping for so much more..."
1,"Molly Maids is pretty hit or miss for a cleaning service. We used them awhile back and they did a pretty good job aside from missing some little things, then we used them a few months ago and they missed some big things such as DUSTING. Considering they send two housekeepers out to the house, I was pretty disappointed.  And they charged us for 2.5 hours for cleaning a small townhome. Seems a little long to me for such a small place."
0,"I have to say I was excited to finally get a chance to dine here. I had read such wonderful things on here about it! Myself and my sister and aunt met there for dinner on my aunts birthday. we looked over the menu and had trouble deciding what to have it all sounded wonderful. My sister and aunt ordered a glass of wine and I ordered the french press coffee -the coffee was wonderful! They ordered a bottle of red that needed to be decanted, and the decanter they used was incredibly awkward to pour while sitting at the table.I decided on the escargot, the salad and the French onion soup. My sister had the mussels appetizer and duck confit and my aunt ordered the escargot and the duck. \nI have never been so disappointed in a meal in my life. The escargot was delivered and looked wonderful with the little puff pastry tops - and had absolutely zero flavor! I will give them that they were tender as they are supposed to be, but there was nothing but a greasy flavor to them and the puff pastry had a stale flavor to it. My sister's mussels tasted wonderful for the first 2 - the rest smelled horrible and tasted worse! not to mention the 2 empty shells and 3 unopened shells that had been served to her. She talked to the waiter and he took the three back with very little being said and brought back 3 more that smelled just as bad and we told him to just take the plate back. We thought it was a little strange that the waiter made very little comments and then the main course was brought out. My salad was fairly bland, the fried goat cheese topping was too thick and not warm and gooey all the way thru and the walnuts were fairly bland. The duck confit was fantastic - perfectly crisp skin and a fantastic flavor though with a wonderful mix of veggies and the scarlett runner beans gave it an edge - mixing a warm earthy flavour to go with the duck. We placed our order for desert - the vanilla souffl\u00e9 with orange sauce. It was totally underwhelming - from the burned, chewy top that when cut and the sauce placed inside the souffl\u00e9 disintegrated - it became a shell. The vanilla used in the dessert tasted like the artificial kind, and the same with the overly sweet and extremely runny orange creme freshe that it was served with. The waiter did see our disappointment at the meal but did not acknowledge it. At the end of the dinner service, when chef came out, he visited all the other tables in the restaurant - it is small, there were only 2 other tables seated. He would sort of glance our way   and seemed uncomfortable that we were still there. (I know what restaurant etiquette is, I was dining with 2 accomplished chefs, one had owned her own restaurant for years) When we got the bill, the mussels were still on the bill - they did not charge us for the dessert. \nI wouldn't mind the total for the bill - with wine it was @ 180.00 with tip - but for the disappointing meal we were served, I do not find this a place I could recommend."
1,"I really wanted to like this company. The employees are lovely people. Unfortunately, I have had nothing but inconvenience working with them.\n\nOver the summer, my dog was playing too rough outside and head-butted our sliding glass door, causing a large spider crack that I haven't had the money to fix until recently. In September, I called Kelly's Glass and Mirror Co, which never took my calls and never returned my messages. At the start of this month, I called Davis because the reviews were so stellar, gave them the dimensions of the door, and was quoted somewhere around $270 for the repair. \n\nThat Wednesday (October 8), someone came to look at the door and told me that the glass would need to be specially ordered and couldn't be fixed that day. I was quoted a new price of $400 and gave my credit card for a deposit. The repairman told me that it would take three days for the glass to come in and that I would be called when it had been received by Davis.\n\nTen days later, I finally received a call from the company and made an appointment for Friday morning (I teach until 3 and lead an after school activity, so both morning and afternoon appointments are difficult to maneuver). I took work off to be present when the repair person arrived.\n\nTwo men came promptly at 9:15, removed the cracked door, and spent fifteen minutes outside before coming back inside to tell me that there was \""something wrong with the glass\"" in the new door, and that it would have to be reordered. They then brought the broken glass door back and replaced it. It had two new cracks that hadn't been there before it was removed.\n\nI now have to miss the after school activity I lead on the upcoming Wednesday to be present for the next attempt at repair. There have been no offers for a price discount. If the door is repaired successfully on Wednesday, the whole fiasco will have taken a three-week turnaround. \n\nThe only reason that I didn't give them one star is that the people I've spoken to have been very, very nice; however, that's just not enough to forgive the number of mistakes that have been made and the amount of time I have had to miss work to deal with them."

1,"I've ordered here before with coworkers and usually, it's pretty decent for the price. (the lunch special)\n\nI ordered teriyaki chicken and when my coworker came back with my food, I honestly didn't even want to eat it. The chicken just looked off and not what I have always been familiar with when it comes to teriyaki chicken. I ate a few bites though because my stomach was growling and after that, I decided to not even touch the chicken and I just ate the rice and eggroll.\n\nThe texture was incredibly rubbery and I am hoping at this point, it was actually chicken that I ate.  It just did not taste or look right at all..."

2,"Alright it's just a Pharmaprix like any other, but it's a big one, and it's one of the few options for pharmacy-type stuff in the neighborhood so I guess I was bound to review it eventually. It's a nice big pharmacy with spacious aisles and big sections devoted to cosmetics, kids, holidays, food, vitamins. There is a Canada Post office in the back and a photo center with some odd sales on iPod docks and Xbox games. The weekly sales make up for the slight over-pricing. Generally things like cream, coffee, cans of soups, toilet paper can be found at 50% once per week.\n\nBut the real issue here is the building. The Pharmaprix is like a white modern building inserted into a gorgeous heritage building. You can't tell it's there from the inside, there is no way to explore or connect with the historical architecture, but you can see it looming above and behind from the outside and while that's better than losing the old artistry entirely it certainly doesn't count as preservation if you ask me. But I may just be bitter because I want inside that amazing old space!!"
3,"This is a great place to go to during the summer time. I love sitting out on the patio. I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the Pittsburgh salad. I would totally recommend getting any of the salads. The steak salad looked amazing (the people next to us got it) and the Pittsburgh salad tasted delicious. My sandwich was fine, but nothing to write home about. Overall, it was a good experience and will most likely be back."
1,"I can't rate the rooms or the complimentary breakfast or anything, because I didn't actually stay there.  I am only rating the service and competence of their reservations system, because I dealt with them when trying to make a reservation for one of our clients.\n\nMy company typically likes to use this hotel for reservations bc it is close to us and convenient for our clients to stay at.  However, this past time, the reservations were a mess.  First, they told us at check in that we had never put down a form of payment and filled out a permission form to use our company credit card -- we HAD and our assistant had specifically spoken with someone about this. But anyway, I decided to just put down my credit card and have my company reimburse me.  So I gave them my info, but for some reason later they asked our client for HIS credit card info and ended up charging his card instead of mine! wth?!  Makes NO SENSE.\n\nSo the next week our assistant had to call them and sort the whole mess out and get the credit put back on our client's card.  Just a totally needless hassle and so unprofessional to mess it up not once but twice."
4,"Want to be treated like royalty?!  You have to visit Cachet Nail Boutique.  I love love this nail salon!  I managed to convince my husband to join me for a mani/pedi.  What we ended up getting was a deluxe package.  He is not a typical guy who likes these excursions and to hear him commented on how much he enjoyed Cachet Nail Boutique was music to my ears.  We were greeted warmly and happily by Trinity, the owner, and her nail techs.  We were invited to enjoy complementary drinks as we discussed what we'd like done.  I had a mimosa and my husband opted for a glass of wine.  The mimosa was delicious and hubby said the wine was good wine.  \n\nEverything about Cachet Nail Boutique invites you to stay and linger a little longer.  \n\nFirst, I would like to comment how trendy, luxurious and tastefully decadent Cachet Nail Boutique is... from the rows of throne-like chairs that is reminiscent of Victorian luxury mixed with modern comfort to a aisle of greenery that separates these chairs.  The plants add to the green-focused of the boutique.  You don't smell that unpleasant odor that usually meets you in other places.  What greets you is beauty and pleasantry.  \n\nThe services are first-class!  Everyone was friendly and engaging.  Several techs worked on me and my husband.  They were talkative without being intrusive. They engaged when we wanted to but also allowed my husband and I to converse and enjoyed ourselves.  \n\nMy toes and nails never looked better.  My husband's toes--what a huge improvement and he loved that they worked on this calluses.  His heels were smooth as can be...  Oh how he raved about them for days after!  He said he would be willing to join me again if we go to Cachet Nail Boutique!"
3,This little dive breakfast joint is amazing. The prices are decent ranging from $7-12 per meal. They don't serve alcohol so don't go looking for a bloody mary or mimosa. The wait was only 10 minutes since I went at 9:30am. They close around noon or 1pm so go early. They had a shaded area and water for people who were waiting. The host was very nice and didn't need to call my name to be seated. The waitress was very attentive and the order prepared perfectly by the kitchen. My boyfriend ordered strawberry and cream waffles and I got the corned beef hash with a side a homemade hash browns. The food was amazing!!!! I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. It's definitely worth the wait!!
0,"I give it one star for being able to cut in line because I was a cute girl alone. Which was so freakin ridiculous to just let certain people in and not others. Lines are for posers, let's me honest. The only way I would stand in a line is if the booze was free.\nI give it negative 1,000 stars because I got pushed about 10 times. I couldn't even get a drink because the bartenders apparently couldn't multi task. No one came up to talk to me. ( I'll leave that to the overall bad flavor I get from OTS). So I stayed until the girls potty line wasn't 10 miles long and ran for my life."
4,"I have been going to them for years now (since their last location). Everyone is friendly and they know what they are doing. They have done an excellent job on my hands and feet EVERY time. Rarely do they make a mistake (everyone does) but if so they will fix their mistake and make it better than before. The atmosphere is relaxing and quiet. The salon is clean and they constantly sanitize their tools. They are careful, quick, affordable, and they do an amazing job on your hands and feet. Sometimes there is a wait so I would call before to make sure they have a spot, so you won't have to wait that long. Everyone in the salon is great but Angel and her husband are the best and they love what they do."
0,"What a scam! We bought the travelzoo voucher for $20 all you can drink. When we arrived we were really disappointed the way the pool area was set up, there wasn't any sun because Palazzo was blocking the sun! I mean who constructs a pool area behind a 30 story building? And this is where it gets really interesting, we got in the pool area all of the chairs had \""reserved\"" signs on them, so we asked how much, $100 A CHAIR! and that was then followed up by, \""you can sit on the side of the pool or lean up against the wall\"" are you kidding me? We went to get a drink, and when I say the alcohol was bottom shelf, I'm being kind. The pool employees all had attitudes and were very rude. This place is a joke."
0,"Waited 45 minutes for an order that was supposed to take 10. Worst part wasn't the wait, the worst part was that with 5 people working the truck we were only given an update on our order 1 time, about 20 minutes into our wait. Mechanical problems are understandable, poor customer service is never excusable. After 45 minutes I asked for a refund, the lady taking the money asked the guy in the truck for the status of the order. He shrugged. I got my refund and moved on. They were also out of over half their menu items at opening time. Back to poor customer service. This is not a truck with it's act together."
4,"What a great show!!\n\nLoved everything about it. The dancers, the beats, the lighting.

0,"Zombie-like service, food mediocre. Meh."
0,"This place is terrible. May be cheaper than other options, but almost every member of the staff has been rude or unprofessional at some point. I pay for all over body, so I pay monthly but they only let me come in every 2 months. Once you've paid they have no incentive to do your treatments. (Every excuse under the sun so the tech can take a break instead of doing your scheduled appointment-- from being \""sunburnt\"" (on my shoulders, when I was going in for armpits) to being 5 minutes late-- when it takes them 20 minutes past your appt time to get u back there.) The girls at the front desk gossip about other employees AND customers, LOUDLY.\n\nNow to rate the service (when they will actually provide to me what I've overpaid for.) They seem to purposefully use the lowest settings over and over so you have to keep coming for a full year or more. Think about it-- once they've tried it on you and your skin has no negative reactions, why not crank up the strength next time? Because you'll get results too quickly, and they'll lose out on robbing you! Also I cannot staand when the tech won't leave the room so I can undress before a Brazilian. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I can't stand this place, but I'm stuck in a damn contract. Don't fall for it. You should be excited to go for a spa treatment, even if it might be painful. I dread going to my appointments because I almost always face some kind of issue or confrontation with the staff."

Now granted the food is mediocre, and some are even pretty decent but the management was TERRIBLE.  We had a large group come and we ordered TONS of food as evident by my 11 pictures (granted that's only a quarter of the table).  We had a few people that couldn't make it but with alcohol we definitely ran a decent tab.  At the end of the evening the staff came by and said we hadn't hit the minimum for the private room and we where going to have to pay the difference.  SERIOUSLY!?!  After much debate, the restaurant allowed they guys paying the tab to buy some additional alcohol to fill the tab.  But since everyone was from out of ton they had to have it shipped.  Guess what... IT NEVER ARRIVED!!!   Overall that really soured the experience.\n\nThe servers were going on about how fresh their fish was and how they would go the airport several times a day and even have clients who would fly in just to eat here. Sadly, When we had asked the them for recommendations, they asked us if we preferred fried or non fried.  We said non fried and they where like \""um... then we don't really know what to recommend.\"" LAME.\n\nAnyway, on to the food.\n\nWe grabbed a few appetizers.  The presentation was nice like on the FLASH FRIED CALAMARI (Who comes up with these names?) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=tSkv98cSBGdPwx2VbdTCIg\n\nThere was an order of SOFT SHELL SPRING ROLLS http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=9Pi4Qm5nH__s4ai6kf1VMw  They were decent but the sauce was noxious.\n\nStand out dishes included\nOMEGA 3 - Seared salmon on one side, with avacodo and Masago mixed into the rice.  Topped with marinated onions and jalapenos this was actually pretty good and I'm not usually a fan of cooked salmon. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=k6jiPToJ1zh8H39zbErOaA\n\nSPICY TUNA NACHOS?  - Not sure if that's the right name.  Now granted it's hard to mess up spicy tuna, but this was decent. I recommended it to someone at the table who didn't really eat raw fish (you should usually recommend Spicy Tuna to sushi neophytes) and she really liked it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=9NWxQ7GiV32EYYi4qRIIGg\n\nFIVE SPICE CHOCOLATE CAKE with GINGER ICE CREAM...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=P0P1mlC0FoMXdvExqadzTg Again, nice name but the not much more than a regular chocolate cake.  \n\n\nOverall, I might have stopped back her for the OMEGA 3 but given the TERRIBLE management and the week staff I probably won't ever be back."
2,"They have amazing pastries here- but I wasn't very impressed by the stuffed french toast. Also, what is with the loaves of bread left out? Are those what we can pick from if we want some bread? They are just out there by the line, and anyone can sneeze or finger them. Ew.\n\nAnyways, I really liked the croissant I got (I had it with Nutella xD) it was flaky and light, and very tasty! All of the breads and pastries looked amazing, and were reasonably priced considering they are fresh made.\n\nI did not like the stuffed french toast at all (we got the apple and raisin), it was bland and had way too much egg batter on it that most of it turned out to be mush. \n\nI will come back to try some other breakfast item, since I really do want to give this place more stars."
0,"Terrible service.  Granted, My husband and i are a huge iron chef and food network fan and had high expectations for the place because we thought Mario batalli's restaurant would impress.  My hubby and I had a pancetta pizza and beef ravioli. They were both prepared well and tasted delicious but both were luke warm at best.  The back waiter gave us bread without olive oil and balsamic we saw him pour for at least 3 other tables.  Our waiter left us unattended for at least a half hour and didn't bring our drinks until after the appetizer.  We asked for additional bread to finish our ravioli sauce but it was forgotten.  With high prices like this I expect great tasting food and attentive service.  Disappointing."
4,"Classic fast food restaurant in Las Vegas for decades.  It has survived for several reasons.  More of a 4.5, than a 5.  The Clucker and Gobbler are their signature items in my opinion\n(My favorite the Clucker).  However, there are other various good menu items."
3,"I have only had lunch at this buffet.  The parking is close and free during the day and you can have your parking validated at night and park for free. As you wind your way through the casino, you find the buffet with a warm golden glow and very clean atmosphere.  Lines come and go depending on time you eat.  The wait staff are quick and courteous and tend to your needs of refills and removal of plates.  The lunch has salad, pizza, spaghetti, veal, meatloaf, brisket, ham, good mashed potatoes, greens, baked and fried chicken, BBQ, vegtables, Asian (not tried) and Mexican foods.  I found the brisket, potatoes, chicken, pizza, greens to be good and topped it off with apple pie and ice cream.  All this for around $8.00.  How could you complain.  The noise level was tolerable.  All the food that I ate was fresh, well heated and I had no issues with flavor.  You are close to downtown and can walk a couple of blocks and be in the middle of downtown.  I would rated this place a 4 star because of the cleanliness, atmosphere, wait staff, location, price, and quality of food.  You would have to be picky and mad at losing to find fault at this buffet for lunch.  I have not had dinner here and read that others complained of a couple of issues, but I can't confirm or deny those comments."
4,Deluxe Electric has done work at my home and my commercial building.  Every thing was done on time and for a great price.
4,The BEST burger I've had in a very long time.  Beats all the other recently popular burger places by far.  Can't wait to go back.
1,"Seriously?!?!?!  I was expecting the most amazing sandwich in the world after seeing this place numerous times on the food network.  Let's just say there are tons of better sandwich places out there.\n\nI came here on a saturday around lunch time with a bunch of friends and had to stand outside in a line for about 15 minutes.  If it weren't for all the hype, I would have never waited in line for such a mediocre meal.\n\nI don't understand why this place is so popular.  The bread is nothing special, just your ordinary white bread, which was soggy by the time the food comes out.  The fires were nothing special, just added carbs.  The sandwich was over-powered by the coleslaw, which i normally like.\n\nI tried the pastrami, hot sausage, and steak sandwich, and all were definitely not worth the hype.  They all came out soggy and tasted like coleslaw.\n\nMy recommendation is to come to this place if you are truly interested in all the hype you see on the food network, but don't come in expecting much."
2,"I've been hitting Dona Maria's since they were located in a strip mall on 10th & Charleston, around 1981 or so. Over the years, they've delivered consistently decent food, with the tamales being their signature item. Nowadays I don't bother with anything other than the tamales, which I order by the dozen and take home. They're still a bargain at $20. Order the hot salsa, it's much, much better than the regular, which is bland, and watery. The hotter salsa is made with roasted chile's. It's texture and color are well balanced with a fiery kick to the palate.\nThe service at the Cheyenne location is fair, but nothing special, or outstanding, which is why I just do the take out option these days. Obviously, they're doing something right because I keep going back after all these years. Overall, they're worth a trip because the Summerlin location is around the corner from my house, but only a 3 star place, IMHO."
4,"This place is awesome! It just opened on Mill and we came here after a baseball game  and caught happy hour. Three of us got a seaweed salad, 2 Philly rolls, a spicy tuna roll, 2 Vegas rolls and a yum yum roll for about $27..  plus the portions are really generous for a sushi place! And being from the bay area we know good sushi and this is def my new favorite spot. Next time we will come here for their drinks happy hour which is also legit."
3,"Okay, I keep forgetting about this market on the west side...\nI do go here when I do remember instead of Lee Lee & Ranch L Market.\nI always load up on basic Japanese cooking supplies; and some fun stuff too.\nThey used to have a little cafe in back; I do miss it..."
0,I specifically made a yelp account to write a review for this restaurant. I used to be frequent at tofu hut before they got shut down. I finally went back today after they reopened. I will RECOMMEND EVERYONE to stay away from here so they can straighten out their defects. Horrifyingly found a BUG in one of my side dish. A Rolly Polly to be exact. I should've learned my lesson when they closed the first time.
0,This place has terrible customer service.  There is only one manager on duty at the front desk.  If u have any problems here they wont be resolved.
3,"Like most of the restaurants in NYNY, this was top notch. A bit pricey for burgers but well worth it. \n\nYou have the choice of the type of meat and they cook it perfectly. Grab a shake from Ben & Jerry to go with it. The fries and onion rings were so good! The staff was friendly and attentive."
4,"Had a really great meal here tonight and a fabulous server that let me customize it.  I ordered the veggie stir fry and asked that no sugar be added to the sauce.  In addition, in lieu of rice, they steamed cabbage for me  My family thinks I am high maintenance but I really appreciate the restaurant working with me!  \n\nSeveral members of our party had sweet and sour chicken and that was delish as well!"
3,"Very pleased with our experience here. It was after a long day and the kids were tired. The store (with the animated animals) and the fish tank distracted them while we were in line. \n\nOnce inside, all the action and noise was great for toddlers. They were occupied with pointing out animals, watching the storms, etc., that we were able to tolerate the delay in getting our food.\n\nIt did take an extra long time to get our drinks and food. (Waiter told us it was the first night with upstairs open and they were getting used to it). But overall everything tasted great. I tried a Coronarita (margarita with a mini Corona in it) which was surprisingly refreshing. I enjoyed a steak and shrimp combo and the wife had a cobb salad which she was very happy with.\n\nPerfect dinner spot for any family with young kids. Just wish that we had gotten our food sooner, so we could get the kids home to bed."
0,"Change your name. I went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable. It's not even a cheese shop. If your interested in purchasing cheese go to Duck & Decanter, Wedge and Bottle, or AJ's."
2,"We got married here on Tuesday, July 12th with about 30 of our family and friends. We were happy with the services and how everything turned out for the most part during the actual wedding day so kudos to Graceland Wedding Chapel for that. \n\nThis review is actually for after the ceremony. The photo package is very confusing. My fiance specifically asked if we could have a digital copy of our photos upon arriving to the chapel the day of the wedding. He was told yes. Now, what he wasn't told was that the photos included in the package would be an additional cost of $10/photo to have a digital copy. Honestly, had I known they would print and send us copies 3 TO 4 WEEKS after the wedding was completed, I probably would have gone somewhere else. Printed photos don't really do much for us nowadays. We wanted to have one of the group photos as the front of the thank you card for our guests, but now we can't because we the photos will take too long. Anyway, they should be more clear when explaining this. Wedding photos are very sentimental and should be available right away. Especially since the photos are uploaded right away on the photographer's website. I've been around long enough to know that it's probably a simple feature the chapel has disabled. It's time to catch up with the times.\n\nThe next review is for the actual wedding certificate. This is partly the County also, but we weren't told to collect our ACTUAL marriage certificate from the courthouse by the minister or the Chapel. With all the commotion of the pictures after the ceremony, I thought the minister handed us our certificate. I purposely took Friday off work to go to the DMV/SS office to complete my name change but upon arriving, I was told this isn't the actual certificate. I called the Clark County Marriage Bereau and was told it would be 2 weeks before I can receive this or I can go in person to collect it. Obviously, I cannot do that being that I am already back at home in California.\n\nAll in all, the actual day of the wedding experience wasn't too bad for the price we paid. The aftermath is a different story. I would have much rather paid more money to have photos available for download (with purchase of course) rather than wait 3-4 weeks for my pictures. It is 2011 and photos/documents should always be at arm's reach, especially from a chapel that has a wedding every 30 minutes and a county that must collect so much from the taxes paid by the casinos. \n\nWell, I just submitted my request for my photos. Let's see if the 3-4 weeks is a true estimate."
3,"So excited to have this new swanky theater so close!! All the seats in the theaters are electronic recliners! Yes, full feet up recliners!! Be careful to not fall asleep like my partner did, because he was so comfortable!\n\nIn the lobby they have a larger savory food selection, wine and other adult beverage. And if you are bringing it back to your seat, don't worry, there is a lap tray waiting for you! Or you can order from the waitress walking around with her iPad ready to happily take your order!\n\nAll of this for the same price as any Regal theater!! HELL YES!!\n\nAnd this part is REALLY IMPORTANT...All of the seats are assigned! Do NOT leave to chance getting a good seat, order your tickets online. Otherwise you will be sitting in the front row, and the last seats available, because everyone else in the theater was smart and reserved their seats online!\n\nAnd you asking \""OK, clearly he loves this place, why not 5 stars?\"" - Glad you asked! The savory food, even though a better than normal selection, was still upgraded Movie Food. With little effort, they could have some really tasty food. And I really dislike having to pay online fees, just to get a good seat, which as I stated is the deal here.  \nBesides those 2 tiny things - AWESOME THEATER!"
4,I love coming to this Starbucks. The staff are amazing and for some crazy reason all their drinks taste better then other starbucks that are local. Love it!
1,"Not sure what the allure is with this place. Maybe because it's in Scottsdale?? We happened to be in the area on a Friday evening so decided to give Jalapeno Inferno a try. There was already a line forming so we took that as a good sign. A couple of seats opened up at the outside bar so we escaped putting our name on a list. The bartender was friendly, but perfunctory. We studied the menu while we waited for our drinks munched on chips. The salsa was very flavorful, and the chips were part corn- part flour. Maybe I'm just a purist, but really?? Chips made from flour tortillas? Ick! I guess that's how they utilize stale flour tortillas, and the snowbirds probably like 'em. I hate rummaging through the basket to get the corn tortilla chips!\n\nFor the entrees we decided on the Tomatillo Chicken Enchiladas and Baja Fish Tacos. Both dishes were mediocre. The tacos were short on fish. The enchiladas had an after-hot, which I liked, but they really weren't anything to write home about.\nGlad we tried the place. I can't think of why we'd go back when there are so many really good Mexican restaurants in town."
0,"Been going there for years. Just went this morning and got a wakeup call that the coffee shop is not for the customers anymore. They dont offer variety as they used to. I used to be ablr to get a 16oz v60 pour over of any coffee today it was only a 12oz with no option and only there \""weekly choice\"" coffee."
0,"Of course the Billy Joel Concert on June 1st was super-awesome featuring probably one of the most creative musicians to ever be born on this planet.  Those fingers on the keyboard were nothing but utterly amazing not to mention listening to those great lyrics that he created.  But let's talk about the US Airways Center AND the selling of beverages.  I could understand scamming people into buying a 10.50 beer because you ARE at a concert and that's what you do.  BUT------ BUT-----  $6.00 for a bottle of water??? That is beyond the pale of greed--- People in Phoenix heat NEED water before they dehydrate.  The body in these Phoenix temperatures is in a constant state of dehydration even after being in the arena.  I would pay 3.50 for water still knowing that the greed factor is in play, but realizing that my body (our bodies) need water.  So scam up the beer, the liquor, the food (that's a whole other review), but don't scam the water. Not in PHOENIX."
0,"First off the gyro is nothing special. Its mediocre at best. I went in and ordered a gyro meal. After 35 minutes of waiting it came out. In the waiting time, the server didn't physically check on me but kept popping his head from behind the counter to look out the window and make sure I was still around. (I was sitting outside) For the first 15 minutes of my wait I was the only person at the restaurant. I was finished with my drink and was not offered a refill. (I wouldn't have even minded paying for one if that were necessary) Some people came there of middle eastern descent and the owner rushed from a hidden place in the back to shake hands with them. Which is cool, but I expect a tiny bit of attention. Regardless, after eating my mediocre gyro and my fries which tasted like they were fried in old reused vegetable oil, I put money under my cup and waited another ten minutes for someone to come out to me just to check on me. The moment I stood up and put my backpack on the worker dropped everything he was doing to run outside and make sure I was going to pay, check presenter in hand and total sputtered out to me as he was walking out the door. I handed him the money that was already down on the table and left.  Awful experience.   \n\n It passes itself off as a sit down restaurant. It really should be like a fast food place.  Probably would work a lot more successful for their lack of service and their general unwelcome feel."
3,"This place is pretty good. Prices seem a little high, but you get a good amount of food. I like the i think its called the \""valley plate\"" or something like that. Its pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice. Good stuff 8 dollars. \n\nIf they happen to be at a place i am at i will stop by (like Glendale Glitters) or Wednesday farmers market downtown"
0,"Good service expensive food and a cockroach that ran up the booth behind my friend while we were eating our food.  We told the manager and he said \""We sprayed the other day\""  Nothing comped and we lost our appetites.  I won't go back."
4,"This place is fantastic if you have children, and great even if you don't.\n\nI remember going there as a child myself, riding the rails, enjoying the play areas.\n\nThere is a carousel, a couple snack bars, model railroads to view, several miniature trains to ride, plenty of picnic tables and benches, and a huge expanse of grass on which to run and play.\n\nGreat park!"
1,"Ugh.. Myst is basically just Myst.\nIt's really nice inside, especially on the ballroom side, however this place is douche wannabe central. Half of the guys here look like they rolled up alone and give off uber creepy vibe. The main dance floor was okay, the big bird feather boots worn by the go go dancer killed it a bit. \nDrinks were pricey. I got a few bought for me so it didn't hurt as bad but still, not worth it.\nWe had VIP so at least we had a place to sit and hang out. I was surprised that it was not even remotely packed. It was definitely a sausage fest. I don't really like Scottsdale clubs much, so by saying that this is your typical Scottsdale club. Nothing special and I would not go back.."
4,I've been shopping at Sally for a couple years and have always had good experiences.  Today I received exceptional service and I had to let folks know.  I came in with a question about gel nails (Gelish vs. IBD).  The lady who helped me called one of her other managers who is a certified nail tech to ask my questions.  They were extremely helpful and went above and beyond what I would expect.
1,"Messed all of our orders up and apparently are confusing Mexican for Asian cuisine because all I can taste is SOY sauce in this steak burrito. Btw Mexican food is made with carne asada, it's not called steak. Fail."
0,"While the price was lower than average for the area it's in (north scottsdale / cave creek) and the the pizza was ready ontime, it was definetly not worth the savings.  This was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had.  My father and I decided to throw the entire thing away after eating just one slice a piece.  I thought the crust was decent, but the sauce tasted like it was out of a can, the cheese tasted like plastic, and the chicken I got on my pizza (yes, I like chicken on my pizza) was a deepfried cutlet that was sliced up and placed ontop.  Eat at your own risk."
1,"Dear Basil Thai, here is a business tip: this group of 9 people that I just brought in is not the only large group I will ever take out to lunch. By making me wait for my itemized receipt while you (repeatedly) checked out single diners, you are telling me that you value their business more than mine. I will not trouble you with my business in the future, as you appear to be unprepared and unwelcoming to university (business) diners."
2,"It's Starbucks. They're everywhere! The one thing I don't like about Starbucks is that they are very inconsistent with their drinks. Some days it taste just how you want it, other days it's too sweet or taste like poop. Work on it Starbucks!"
0,"I hate to be redundant but Suzie's review from 6/16/2014 is spot on. \n\nPriority appliance was assigned to fix our dishwasher by our home warranty company. No one ever answers the phones. You are given a few options/departments to choose from when you call and then you can leave a message but good luck getting anyone to call you back uncles you leave a barrage of messages. \n\nAnd then when they \""schedule\"" an appointment they call you the day before between 4 and 4:45p and whether you answer or not they tell you they will be there the next day within a 4 hour window and That they will call again when the Tech is on the way and if YOU DONT ANSWER then they wont show up. So you have to literally sit there staring at your phone waiting for their call otherwise if you miss the call it's not like you can call them right back and say you're home. You call them and they never answer and that's ok. They call you and if you miss that call... Well then, too bad for you. \n\nWhat is wrong with this company???? \n\nThe most frustrating thing is that we are at their mercy since we are going through our warranty company to get the dishwasher repaired. Otherwise I would have changed to a different company already."
4,"My family and I have been going to the Encore for quite a few years.  I've stayed at plenty of hotels in Las Vegas, and the Encore is by far the most beautiful, classy, and luxurious hotel in all of Sin City.  \n\nReceiving a spa treatment (or two hehe) is always a must in this indulgent city.  The Encore Spa is not only the best spa in Las Vegas, but it is the best spa I've ever been to!  I've received treatments from makeup application, to manicures and pedicures, to massages.  All services are definitely expensive, but well worth your money.\n\nThe most memorable experience I've had was a couples massage with my best friend in January.  The Spa was absolutely gorgeous- from the jacuzzis to the private showers.  The lounge was unbelievable, and the blankets are softer than a group of puppies on clouds!  My friend and I had a hard time telling ourselves not to purchase one at the gift store.  (We even considered gambling to win enough money so we could buy them without guilt.)  \n\nThe beautiful and zen atmosphere of the Spa at the Encore was one I've never experienced before.  If I could, I'd receive a spa treatment every day there and spend the entire day lounging, drinking fresh mint tea, and chilling in the j-cuzz!"
2,"This is a nice, low-key strip club.  The dances are cheap and the girls seem to understand that they have to work for their money.  The only downside is that there are a lot of average looking girls here who aren't as attractive as the girls at a lot of other clubs that I've been to.\n\nThere was a dancer I met here a couple of months ago who blew my mind with her private dance.  Unfortunately she has left the club from what I understand but I would have proposed to that girl in a second.  LOL."
3,"First time eating at any Fatburger. This place is great! I had a delicious turkey burger, which exceeded my expectations. The food is made to order, so you do have to wait. But you know the food has not been quietly growing stale and dry in an aluminum bin like in fast food restaurants. The cook actually brought the order out to the table, which was unexpected! My only criticism is that the restaurant did not have good air circulation and had a stuffy feeling."
1,"For all the hype, I wasn't impressed. The food was good, but I thought the prices were high for what you get. I would try it again though, to see if my mind changes."
0,"I've been to Carnevino twice and have been very disappointed both times.  I'm a big fan of Mario Batali and had high expectations.  I've been to Osteria Mozza in LA and absolutely loved it. But my two dinners at Carnevino have been hugely disappointing.\n\nFood-wise, the steaks at Carnevino are just okay.  Both times I've been there, I've ordered steak prepared the way the chef prefers - usually rare or medium rare.  Both times I've found the steak to be too tough, too chewy or too fatty.  The taste is good but I've had steaks at some of the best steakhouses in the world and this place is 3rd tier -- not second tier, 3rd tier.  Mortons and The Palm, even the Old Homestead are better.  Don't go here for steak.  \n\nAnd I hate to say it, but don't go here for the pasta either.  I've been disappointed both times with the pasta which is just ho-hum.  Compared to our nearly orgasmic experience at Osteria Mozza, this wasn't even in the same ballpark.  I hate to admit it but we had a much better meal at Rao's the night before (even though their meatballs are too dense).\n\nWe went to Carnevino to celebrate my bachelor party -- there were 10 of us -- and I can honestly say that the poor and insulting service ruined our dinner.  Thanks being huge a-holes Carnevino!  Let me explain.\n\nThe sommelier  (Kirk) was a complete and utter douchebag to my friends. One of my friends asked if they carried a certain wine and Kirk's response was, \""Good God no.\""  It wasn't like we requested Night Train but this a-hole Kirk acted aghast, the needle skipped off the record, EF Hutton-style.  \""Good God no... too buttery.\"" That's a really pompous answer and made my friends feel like crap.  Thanks Kirk, you pretentious wine Nazi.  I hope your acrid douchebaggery gets you far in life.  A better answer would have been, \""Sorry sir, we don't carry that wine.\""  You're lucky you didn't get your twitty glasses knocked off your face.\n\nSecondly, the waiter (don't remember his name but he was a tall dude and also wore hipster 50s style glasses) suggested that we order a bunch of appetizers and pastas for the table.  We said sure, but I told him that some of the people don't eat shellfish so stay away from seafood.  What did we get?  Calamari (shellfish), crab salad (shellfish), and another seafood dish.  Moreover, we got 5 sets of 3 -- 15 appetizers for 10 people (with pasta and main dishes to come.)  It felt like the guy was trying to take advantage of us.  It was too much food.\n\nAlso, we received an extra dessert that nobody ordered.  We pointed it out to the waiter and instead of just leaving it (which is typically what is done in a fine restaurant, considering that we're running up a bill of over $2,000) he took the dessert away.  I mean, how much of a dick can you be?  We spend over $2,000 there and you're going to take a cruddy little dessert off the table?  I think that really says it all.\n\nOn the spectrum of \""fine restaurants\"" this gets 1 star; on the spectrum of all restaurants, maybe 2.5-3 stars. None of us will ever eat there again and I'll do my best to spread the word about how crappy the service and food is at this place.  I will continue to patronize Mario Batali's restaurants because I can only presume he doesn't know how bad this place really is but if you have good taste and know what it is to get good service, you'll give the middle finger to Carnevino."
2,We Delivery!  Well u can also eat in as we found out yesterday.  We were in the neighborhood and found this place through yelp.  \n\nThe address is a little off if you are using GPS.  Just know it is in the Food Lion stripmall area.\n\nIt is very typical Chinese food (and some curry dishes??  lol)  The interior was very much McDonalds leftover furniture - super plain jane.  Tons of people were coming through for pickup orders when we were sitting there.  The food is about $8 bucks for each dish like your typical lo mein and General Tso's chicken.  Everything was very normal about this place and if it was closer to uptown I would definitely go back for the rare Chinese food craving.
0,"ONLY stay here if you are 1. Staying for one night and 2. planning on only being there to sleep for 7 hours and then leave.  The place is dirty dirty dirty.  The carpet in the hallway is very dirty.  Our sheets had stains.  I didn't even go in the bathroom (again, we literally only slept in the room for about 7 hours got up and left) but looking in it I didn't like what I saw. If you are looking for a cheap place to crash after a night of reliving college, then this is the place.  Otherwise fork over a little bit extra cash and stay somewhere nicer."
1,"You would think all the Sam Woo's would produce the same quality of foods.  Well I was partly wrong.\n\nThe only thing they DO share is the stupid \""cash only\"" sign.\n\nMy family got 2 porridges, clam in black bean sauce and seafood fried noodles.  It was good until we got to the porridges.  Isn't preserved duck eggs porridge suppose to have SOME kind of flavor?  It tasted like plain porridge.  How do you even fail porridge?  That is almost unheard of."
3,so the first step is admitting you have a problem right? I admit I drive by places that are right by my house and then I try them eventually and find out i have been missing out on spectacular food all along.

4,"This was insane!!!! Awesome show from start to finish. This tribute to the beatles in Cirque du Soleil flavor was purely sick. The stage props, performers, music and overall concept/imagery made this better than a rock concert. The theater does not have a bad seat and the acrobatic ability of the performers was draw dropping. Ihave seen three other Cirque shows. this is by far the best..\n\nWhen in Vegas go see this show....."
0,"Went there tonight and it's closed by the health department for a fail on reinspection, GROSS"
1,"Cheap, lousy truck stop food.  Everything on the menu is either frozen, or comes from a can.  I honestly can't recommend this place, unless you are very hungry and low on cash."
0,"I don't know what is squeakier in these theaters... The hips of the older crowd that filled 95% of the seats, or the chairs EVERY time someone shifted their weight. The chairs were just ridiculous. The olds, just meant more talking during the movie.\n\n Also the arm rests are awful! They are concave and hardly padded at all, in between hard plastic edges!!! So it feels like you are resting your arm on bones.\n\nAnd a minor complaint, the bathrooms don't have a paper towel option to dry your hands, only blowers that blow cold, not warm, air. After a 2 hr movie, in a cold theater, that is not pleasant at all!"
0,How hard is to keep track of a small fry and smoothie? They have yet to get my or my parent's order right at this location. It would seem that management is lacking as everyone is standing around trying to figure out what they should be doing.
2,Well above average neighborhood sushi joint.  I have had very nice quality fish here.  But potion can sometime be a bit on the small side.
0,I ordered a birthday cake for my son's birthday.  It was supposed to be a sponge bob cake.  I went to pick it up and was beyond disappointed by this cake. It was horrible.  I started looking at it and just couldn't believe they actually would sell it.  I asked if this was really the cake and if their cakes look like this. She said yes they are not culinary experts.  I told her it wasn't worth $40. The lady behind me joined and told me it wasn't. I really could've had my 8 year old do a better job. I did feel bad for the employees. They knew it didn't look good and didn't know what to.  I've included a picture.
0,"My wife and I just spent two nights here. We were staying in Vegas and we had a discount coupon for The Quad. While we were checking in two girls behind us blurted out \""There's blood on the sheets!\"",.You could see from the Registration desk that the place was under construction, but at the time I just thought \""Meh...no biggie.\"" We were traveling with two small dogs, so they put us in the \""Pet Friendly\"" section, which meant go to the main elevator, go up one floor, get off, walk down a hallway, get on another elevator, go down one floor, and then go find your room. We had already had a long drive that day, and I wasn't feeling real well, and now this...\n\nThe guy at the desk told us that The Quad was formerly the Imperial Palace, and indeed it did still have vestiges of its old, tacky, oriental trimmings.\n\nBut to the point...this place was the absolute WORST hotel my wife and I have ever in our entire lives stayed at, and we're both 56 years old. We've stayed in LOTS of hotels over the years, and disgusting is not strong enough language to describe this place. Now, coming from California, we're kinda used to not smelling cigarette smoke in public places anymore. But nobody goes into a Vegas casino not expecting to have to deal with that smell. We're not gamblers, we didn't go to Vegas to party, drink, or gamble, they offered us a 'cheap' room for two nights so we took the bait (The bill for two nights there came to almost $160). The problem was that EVERYWHERE we went in the hotel the place was absolutely permeated with the acrid, sickening stench of tobacco smoke. The carpets EVERYWHERE were stained and filthy. Wallpaper was peeling. Elevators were broken, and the two that did work were too small to handle the traffic in them and they were noisy and rickety...\n\nAnd now on to our \""room\"", which was closer to a prison cell. The one window, which had no appreciable view, was reinforced and could not be opened. If there ever was a fire-God forbid- there was no staircase from which to escape that part of the building. If you could find something hefty enough to smash out that reinforced glass the window was still high enough from ground level that you'd likely break a leg jumping out. There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room, which is common fare in the cheapest roach motels nowadays, and the tub drained VERY slowly. The room stank and the carpets were stained and dingy.\n\nReally, even though the hotel management says this place is being 'renovated', at the very least it needs to be completely shut down, carpet pulled up EVERYWHERE, wallpaper stripped off throughout, elevators taken out and replaced with new ones, plumbing replaced, entire building brought up to some semblance of compliance with modern fire codes, all the stupid and offensive 1960s ornamental trinketry removed, and the rebuilt with late 20th-century amenities like refrigerators and microwaves.\n\nActually, it would make a lot more sense to just demolish this stinking, wretched dump and start over again. The only reason I gave it one star was that a \""no-star\"" option was not available. Putrid, filthy, and absolutely DISGUSTING. .Do NOT under ANY circumstances EVER stay here. If it catches fire-God forbid-you could DIE."
2,Really?  The best in Vegas?  Saw it a month ago and was mildly amused.  Perhaps the actors knew it was the last three weeks they'd be working and didn't feel like putting effort into it but it wasn't worthy of being called Disney.  I do enjoy puppets though...
2,"I ordered a sausage park hero and a coke.   Loved the food and service was fine.   My only issue with them was the portion size or the dollar amount paid.  My order cost me over $10.00. And what I got was 2 sausage links on both ends of the hero.   Like I said, I enjoyed it.. I just thought the price could have been cheaper or the portion size bigger.   Other then that I thought it was a good place to try out."
2,"I really enjoyed the set-up of the restaurant. The side room looks very authentic. The staff are nice enough, although the service isn't exactly prompt and polite. Great food!"
3,"Highly recommend La Bocca! I used to work in Tempe, so La Bocca was a favorite lunch spot among our office, especially for lunch meetings with clients and out of town guests. I've tried pizzas, salads and bruschetta, and not once was I ever disappointed at La Bocca. Favorite items are the truffled mushroom pizza and the pear salad. Their sangria is awesome also. The vibe of the restaurant is nice/trendy, and they have a great patio for days that aren't too hot."
2,"food choices are wide in variety, airport is clean, bathrooms are nice, but it is WAY too cold in here. it's 35 degrees outside, and hardly 50 degrees indoors. it's early in the morning, people!!! either hand out some blankets or crank the heat. it's mid-december, not summer."
3,"This is the best dog park I've been to, unfortunately the same lady who usually goes to Quail Run Park is here every few days and her dog attacked mine, just like the last time. I hope she'll stop coming so my dog doesn't have to miss out on the fun because she doesn't know how to train her dog to know the word 'NO'. Other than this one owner, the park is great."
1,"Was quite underwhelmed to be perfectly honest. Slow service, pricier than some competition and for what? The food was just ok, no one was impressed; there are much better places to go for Mediterranean food in town. This restaurant may have been great under its previous management, but we won't be returning."
1,"I've been here a handful of times over the last 2 years but after my most recent experience, I won't be returning. I showed up an hour before their posted closing (7:30pm) time and was told they were closed. The woman working didn't even acknowledge my question regarding their business hours. Even before this, the staff is typically unfriendly. The place feels dingy and crowded. It's really not worth saving a few bucks."
3,The log cabin lodge in the desert! Food was great!
1,"sushi is kinda like sex. or chocolate.\nthere are varying levels of quality,\nbut can it really be bad?\nI think RA is def. meh\nit's a little spendy\nit's usually pretty crowded w/ a lame coterie of student/yuppie/douche hybrids.\nit's sushi is good\nbut like i said, kinda hard to mess up......well....that's probably not true. I am sure if i tried to make sushi i could fuck it up royally\nbottom line: there are better places, and there are worse. if you like the mill ave crowd then please c'mon down and make it rain!"
1,"The food here at Mattas is average at best. However way over priced. I ordered a chile relleno taco combo, and added an additional taco at a cost of 6.99 for the added taco. To add to my surprise of the cost of the ala carte taco is how the food was plated, both tacos were resting in the beans and relleno sauces making them soggy and unable to be picked up. I was surprised a restaurant that's been in business this long does not know or show their cooks how to properly plate food. All this being said my family and I have been three times and will not be going back."
0,I was visiting some relative in the area and stopped at this Starbucks.  I visit a lot of Starbucks and this store seems poorly managed.  The wait was 20 minutes for our  simple order after we paid.  The staff were more concerned about drive thru customers who paid after us than our order.  There were no tables inside so we went to sit outside.  As we were sitting outside the manager INTENTIONALLY shut off the misters when it was 110 degrees.  He claimed they stopped working. But they mysteriously shut off after our neighboring table complained about the poor service.
0,"Even though we were the only customers there, we had to wait an hour for our mediocre pizza.\nAt one point while we waited, another customer (apparently a regular customer) came in with his dog.  We watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area.  Yuck.  If we hadn't been starving, we would have left immediately."
2,"I was here the other day and it was a great hangover cute. However their omelette did not have a lot of flavour and the hash-browns needed a lot of salt. It was alright on the whole, the atmosphere and wait staff were great but I expected a more flavourful meal. It's decent but nothing to write home about."
2,"The food at Olives is not as good as you'd expect for the price tag, but it receives 3 stars from me for the extras.\n\nFirst, the bread basket is totally yummy. There's a variety of breads to keep you happy while you wait for your meal, and each one was good. Second, the atmosphere is quite nice. It's upscale-ish without falling all over itself. Third, we were given a stellar table for a reservation made 2 hours in advance, for 12 people, on a busy Saturday night.\n\nThe food is oversalted and under-tasty. We were all happy enough with our meals, as it tasted good, but nothing about it made us feel like food is the focus at Olives. I think they are banking on the location inside Bellagio and the atmosphere to be the draw, and serving good-but-not-great food."
0,"What a mess.\n\nFirst, I called to make reservations for 6:00 PM.  I called at 1:00 and they put me on hold for 10 minutes.... to make a reservation.\n\nI called back an hour later and made the reservation.  When I showed up, they didn't have it.\n\nThey told me we would have to wait for 40 minutes, even though the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  (That's another sign.  Where is the business during Friday dinner).\n\nThey seated us early.  Didn't matter.  It took an hour to get the food.  I could hear the manager apologizing to another table next to us, so it must be common.  \n\nNot only that, people who showed up later got their food earlier.  And the food?  Nice and cold.\n\nBoycott this place.  Maybe we can get a better restaurant to replace it."
2,"First time here. Prices were reasonable and the line was long. The eggs and toast were good, about average but the French toast I did not care for it had too much cinnamon and just didn't taste as well as I had expected. My daughter would not eat it as it was too flavorful for a child's palate. Overall pretty good ."
3,I love this place. If you are visiting Vegas or a local this is a must. The environment is trendy and fun. Portions are huge so be prepare to share or take some left overs home. They also have this really cool fire-pit bar area where you can chill have drinks and appetizers while sitting in front of a water fire place. Another favorite thing about this place is their colorful sugar! So cute.
2,"We ate here twice, once for lunch and the following day we came back with friends for dinner.  \n\nLunch was outstanding, good service and great food.  I had the Wednesday daily special and it was delicious.  My wife had the chicken piccata and loved it enough to order it again the next night.\n\nDinner on Thursday night managed to knock off two starts.  We were seated quickly enough, the waiter came to take our drink orders and disappeared for a while.  The food finally arrived after a lengthy wait.  The waiter dropped it and ran.  I asked for another glass of wine that never arrived.  In fact we never saw our waiter again for over 45 minutes.  He never came back to check how the food was or to see if we needed anything else.  Never.  Finally we asked to see the manager who arrived 20 minutes later and listened to our complaints but really didn't seem interested in doing anything about it.  They offered to comp our drinks but the waiter never came back to take any drink orders (other than my glass of wine which never arrived) so that was a no go.\n\nSo the five of us left rather irritated with the poor service, this is the Bellagio after all!  On the upside the food we were served was outstanding, it just takes a while to be served and order your drinks early, they may never come."
2,"It's a giant convention center. I mean giant! You won't believe how big this place is since it doesn't look so huge from the outside. The halls are massive and can hosts lots of conventions at once.\n\nThey have been doing some renovations so the bathrooms are nicer, and the common areas have new carpet and furnishings. There are some shiny new Coke machines ($3 for a 20 ounce bottle) as well.\n\nThe biggest plus for the Sands Convention Center is that it's connected to the Venetian / Palazzo so it's right on the Strip (and during breaks you can walk to those properties for lunch instead of getting stuck at the ridiculously overpriced snack bar).\n\nThe biggest negative is the drop-off area. It is INSANE. There is one teeny tiny little underpass where you can get a taxi or have someone meet you. When I have a convention, I walk a few blocks and have my husband pick me up down the street. It can take a long time for cars to get through traffic just to turn IN to the place."
2,"Oh The Good Egg. Or as I call it the I'm OK and Your Just Kinda OK Egg. Mediocre. Meh. Harmless not harmful. Kitchy but not catchy. Basic breakfast fare that tries to go outside the box with egg white omelets, low carb tortillas and southwestern fare. It's been called the Gay Egg and on weekends The Way Gay Egg. I appreciate its niche in the Phoenix restaurant scene. I do. It beats Denny's and IHOP. But now has competition from Matt's, Palette and Over Easy. I\""m partial to any Central Ave. business and am sure I'll find myself here again. Service is mixed. Most are pleasant. Some. Well, some of them need a nap. While others might benefit from a double shot of espresso. I hate sitting at the horseshoe shaped counter. I find myself staring at the weathered individuals across the way wondering, \""Gee, do you really need that extra bacon?\"". And on the flip side, I catch a few eyeballs focused on me and they're probably thinking, \""I can't believe that guy has Hello Kitty sunglasses! Fag!\"""
1,"We had family in town for the holidays and we wanted to take them somewhere special. The reviews came in positive, so we decided to try the notorious pink pony.we thought the food was below average, not worth the money we paid. The rib eye steak was good not great, the sides were blah. To sum up our experience !! I will never ever eat there again, I won't even recommend to my worst enemy. 2 thumbs down !!!!"
4,great!
2,"I can't say that this is my favorite upscale place in Madison. But the ambience is great - my boy and I visited here on our first official date!\n\nThe steaks are good, you can feel safe here asking for a black and blue (which is even rarer than rare!). Seafood is good here too. I like it here, but my favorite thing is the bread and butter!!?!?!?! There's always 3 different kinds of butter/cream cheese - 1 regular and 2 special flavors. so gooooooddddd. Otherwise... I'm alright about this place.\n\nAmbience is great but somehow the tables are too huge when a couple sits across each other.. A little loud to chat across the table though. \n\nIn summary, come here for a special night to get steaks done just the way you like or for some lobster Mac and Cheese ;)"
0,"Just called to place an order, and the guy hung up on me. He said my number was blocked.  I ended up calling back and the guy blocked my number? WTH  Im just trying to order food I work a graveyard shift. Very bad customer service!!! i will be contacting Chri the owner/manager in the morning. Very bad customer service. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"
2,Happy hour was slow. Took 10 min for someone to take our drink and 20 min to get it. Tasted like all soda water and NO vodka. They made no effort to compensate us.
1,"Well, I'm a vegetarian and they took the \""That's Cheesy\"" item off the menu, so now I can't join my friends when they dine here. This place can get a little busy causing long wait times and horrible service. Once it took my party of 8 almost an hour to get our meals! They didn't even offer to bring us our fries first! At least we got apologies? Whatever. Apologies do not mean anything to a big hungry group of people. 2 Stars for the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Apple Lychee Soda."
2,"After getting hitched, the newly brain washed spouse and his ball and chain decided to go to this little gem in Desert Shores in the NW.\n\nWe sat outside, which has limited seating.  The tables were aligned near the man-made lake with view of homes across the way, that's a -1 star. At least they try.  I can listen to the live spanish guitar entertainment all day, that was definately worth dining here. \n\nOn to the food... onion soup and the mushroom soup were okay.  I had the crab cakes and it was 3.5 star, it was petite but had some flavor. Hubby had scallops with rosotto which he enjoyed.   \n\nThe service was okay.  I expected him to at least show up a bit more often and be some what friendly. \n\nDon't come here hungry.  Will we come back again, probably not."
0,"The pancakes are not all they're cracked up to be, far from, actually. My one star is for the fresh orange juice. I had the saddest hash browns ever, lousy sausage, mediocre eggs and some toast I didn't even care to touch. Could have had the same meal at Denny's for half the price and with better service. On top of that, we had to wait more than half an hour for our meal which of course arrived right at the moment where we had almost decided to leave the god awful place. Unacceptable and below all standards."
4,The chefs were very nice.  Our waiter was friendly & knowledgeable.  I would have liked our area bussed more but that would have been my biggest complaint.  All in all no biggie.  That Red Bull roll should be tested for illegal substances bc that is addictive!\nThank you for the great local sushi joint with service to match.\nMy husband approved of the short skirts on the waitresses.  We didn't drink but I can imagine hanging out in their bar area with friends.\n\nP.S. I feel the prices were reasonable as well.
2,"I gotta say for Vegas, which does not have good sushi, this might be the closest to good sushi I have found.  I had fun.  Our chef would not allow us to tell him our order which is frustrating.  First time in 50 sushi restaurants I had to use the pencil and paper.  They have a few really good rolls.  I filled up before I got to the lobster roll.  Someone will have to update me on that one.  They are half the price but the rolls are half the size.  The grill is a definite must as they were entertaining us from a distance.  This looks like it might be the place for that as many people were having a blast.  I will be back for a review when I try that.  As for the sushi, I give it a one thumb up."
3,"Overall, I had a great experience at this hotel. Their staff is friendly, and they were very accommodating to my non-smoking needs even though I had a late check-in.\n\nThe rooms are a bit dated, but then again, this hotel doesn't charge the same 5-star prices as some of the other high end places on the strip. Rates seem relatively reasonable, and the hotel and rooms are clean and well maintained.\n\nGoing here isn't like going to NYC (that would be unreasonable). Then again, you don't feel like you're in Italy when you stay at the Venetian, nor do you feel like you're in Egypt when you stay at the Luxor. I think some people may take the \""theme\"" a bit too seriously.\n\nAll-in-all, friendly staff and service do it for me. The clean rooms and well-maintained atmosphere are nice too."
2,"Ohhhhh Saint-Sulpice. What I like to call my 'first-year' stomping ground. This place is a university bar mixed with St-Denis chic with a little trashy Quebecois-ness thrown in for good measure. This place has the largest patio EVER, its really quite grotesque (in the best way possible) and its always teeming with people in the summer. It makes for the perfect place to sit on a hot summer's night and refresh with a pitcher or a pint. The inside itself is equally massive. The facade is deceptive, you think 'oh that looks like a cute little bar,' until you realize this place spans like a city block and goes on for many floors. The basement is a mixture of coat check-club-bar. The floor doesn't know what it make of itself but it seems to be where the drunkest people congregate. The second floor is the main floor and it features another bar, with bathrooms, and rooms where people sit and drink with table service. There is another floor, the 'library' floor which is this odd combination of library and drinking room. But its where people sit to drink and chat. Now, the final floor is perhaps where things get most interesting. This is the straight-up 'club' floor with its own bar, dancing platforms, and smoking room. There is nowhere to sit and its pure Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. The discotheque tends to be get packed, sticky, and raunchy. Which are qualities that are really best suited for the really inebriated. They have a patio so you can duck off for a quick smoke and the hit the floor soon after if you're so inclined. \n\nThe crowd is really a bizarre mixture of people. Gangsters, slutty Anglophone girls, American tourists who stumbled across the first watering hole, Quebeckers from the east end, some gays, some Latinos, Arabs, etc. etc. There is no 'typical' clientele at this place and it plays to every niche you could think of. Attention girls: most of my girlfriends agree this place attracts the 'aggressive' types unlike any other bar/club in the city. There are guys on the prowl here and they're looking for ass. So be forewarned (maybe because theres a strip joint across the street??) you'll be groped. \n\nBut: the drinks are cheap cheap cheap. Make sure you ask the bartender for the nightly specials. They often have draft beer for like $2.50 which is pennies compared to most places. I always stick to beer/shots here if only because the bartenders could not make a proper mixed drink to save their life. Also, it TIP the bartenders. They're VERY aggressive about tipping--I guess cause many people don't--and they will flat out ask you to tip/give more money if they're not satisfied. $2/drink is the minimum. Now, if you DO tip you'll get great service for the rest of the night and they'll come to you first even if they're faced with a bar full of other patrons. So open your wallets to enjoy friendly bartenders and plentiful drinks. It helps to speak French here too (like most places in Montreal) for all you bilinguals in the crowd."
3,HOUSE MUSIC I'm there.\n\nThe venue was very crappy I'll admit that but when you hear the music they are playing you just want to dance. Yeah you will see some strange people there after 3am. I saw a guy Rolling on the couch and a girl giving him a shitty light show. I took one star away because well Not that many people there and if you want to bust your moves you can.\noh yeah Drinks are very water down no alchohal at all.\n\nBEWARE: If you house there you might attract some gay people and they will probably dance infront of you.
4,"Okay, so it's just a freaking sandwich.  I know people say that it's over rated and well yeah, it is a bit over rated but it doesn't warrant the 1 star review.  Actually, there's no need for me to even write a review because this place has at least a few thousand.  So why did I give 5 stars?  Because look at where you're at.  Vegas is like a giant airport where the food is jacked up to 60% of the actual retail price.  I bought a slice of pizza and a coke one time somewhere and had to pay 12 bucks. Yeah, 12 motherfucking bones.  So let me tell you that Earl of Sandwich earns the 5 stars because for a pretty delicious fuckin sando, you only pay 6 dollars in a land where they would usually charge 12.  So there's my blurb right there.\n\nLine is pretty long, but it goes by fast and you rarely wait more than 5 minutes to get your order.  Not only that, the process of ordering to paying to getting your sandwich is so streamlined and smooth- there's no kinks to the process which is why they can go through so many people so fast.\nI ordered the tuna melt and it was decent- I really like their bread and the portions were good.  A half would have satisfied me but I went ahead and ate the other half because I'm to lazy to carry it around with me.  \n\nOverall - not the best sandwiches in the world, but they're still GOOD and you get the most bang for your buck here.  Plus, the joint is open 24 hours."
3,"Not sure why it took me so long before my 1st visit, considering I have worked on this block of Park Road on-and-off for a long time.  I met up with my chicas after work on St. Patty's Day.  The place is small... but we didn't have to wait.  Thursday is their $2.50 Pint Night, and with some exclusions on the higher priced beer  there are still plenty of choices.  However I am almost beer illiterate, so it was like reading French when I was trying to decide on my beer order.  Ended up with a pilsner (you should be happy I remember that word...), it was still kind of hoppy for my taste.  Sometimes I just want to see the word Bud, or Miller.\n\nI ordered a 1/4 lb. Carolina Burger.  To my surprise, it is only $5.29 for that and it even comes with 1-side.  Sweet potato fries was delicious.  Their regular fries weren't bad either.  Most of the sandwiches/salad are around $8.99.  One of the girls ordered a salad and it was huge.  \n\nService overall was decent, even after it got busy.  I give this place a solid approval."
1,"We've been there twice since their opening (assuming it's only a soft opening) and the experience has been lack-luster.  The interior renovations are nicely done, but the staff and food are meh.  I appreciate the heathier options on the menu, but they have been poorly executed on my plate.  The staff seems bored and more often socializing with each other rather than at least attempting to look busy or interested.  This place is close to our home and I expect will give it one more try - will update with results!"
1,"Where to start...I really really wanted to like this place.  It was our first time here and we like to try a new place on Date Night, so we went here, after hearing some pretty great things.  \n\nThe host was nasty right away, which should have been the first sign.\n\nWe were seating downstairs for dinner, during happy hour when everyone was upstairs.  This was kind of nice, hearing the music and noise but having the restaurant to ourselves.  \n\nOur waitor was really great, very friendly and super helpful.  We ordered an app and I got the seafood platter off menu and the bf got a steak.  \n\nInstantly, we realized the food just wasn't prepared great or wasn't top quality.  The steak came out a bit cold, which was shocking.\n\nWe couldn't do dessert, I just can't have someone destroy that for me.  All in all we spent about $120 with tip and just wish we had not even bothered. Not a fan."
4,"Tried this spot a few months ago with two friends, and we made the mistake of \""sharing\"" the orange fennel salad...we were literally fighting over it! Wish I lived closer because I'd probably head over once a week just for that amazing salad. Also ordered the green chili burger on the GIGANTIC English Muffin, which was tasty with a little kick. Ended the meal with a decadent salty n' sweet chocolate chip cookie from the adjacent bakery...and by then I was in a delightful food coma."
1,Stayed here one night while visiting Charlotte. Place is not the worst iv seen but DEFINITELY not the best. Place seems kinda old and run down....halls and rooms are smelly. Just a place to stay if you need a cheap room to get ya some.
2,had the hav a chicken sandwich- it was very good. a bit pricey so i didn't get fries but the service was good
2,The best part of my meal was my drink. I had fireball and hard cider. For dinner I had  the chicken and waffles. They were ok. Probably would have been better if it was hot. But getting back to the drink. Yummy! Perfect for the season.
1,"Ended up here last week looking for a quick place to have lunch with a friend.  we thought they weren't open but someone came out and waved us in.  trying to catch a movie in an hour we decided to try them out.  we were first disappointed to find out that they don't have chicago style thin crust.  \""They have flatbread\""  but this was remiss.\n\nlet me preface by stating I spent the first 18 years of my life growing up in Northern Illinois and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about chicago pizza, generally you have your more popular Chicago style deep with the stuffed topping and a layer of sauce on top, then the lesser known \""but still delicious\"" Chicago style thin, which is thicker than NY style usually square cut with lots of cheese and some of the toppings under the cheese, usually with sweeter sauce.\n\nwell Uno doesn't have this, they have flatbread, but I'm sorry I thought I was going into an \""AUTHENTIC CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA\"" place for a chicago style pizza.  After we gave up the dream of thin crust we ordered a deep dish with a few meats. a while later (remember it's deep dish) we got our pizza and although it wasn't bad it wasn't anything special and I think they should maybe tone it down on the \""CHICAGO THIS, and CHICAGO that, keep your windy city to yourself, cuz I'm not fooled\""\n\nI give them credit for getting the pizza out in a reasonable time frame, but paying $25 for a pizza that was \""alright\"" didn't leave me in a good mood.  But you can be kind of a dick about pizza when you grew up eating what you believe is some of the best pizza in the world."
3,Went for brunch today by suggestion of a friend and was very pleasantly surprised.   Our server was very friendly and attentive and helped us with the menu and any questions we had...   Some of the things that made me love this place was 1- the bottomless champagne brunch 2-the food was great.   I got the green Chile burger substitute for chicken and it was delish ! 3-BOTTOMLESS CHAMPAGNE... \n\nI will be going again!
2,"I was here twice within 16 hours of each visit. \n\nFirst was New Years Eve dinner. It was a 7 course pre fix menu with wine pairings. The portions were small and food was nothing great. The amount of wine you were given was like a thimble full and when I asked for more I was told I would be charged extra. Lots of cream based offerings.Very Very expensive and not worth it. The service was exceptional though. I give the total experience two stars. Once again , ordering off the regular menu was not an option.\n\nSecond was New Years day brunch buffet. Great food. All entr\u00e9es were cooked to order and the service was again fantastic. The cost was very reasonable. I give it four stars.\n\nI would like to try this place again for dinner by ordering off the main menu and see how that goes."
4,"We attended the circus performance at Superstition Springs Mall in Mesa 2014. The only other circus we have attended in the Ringling Brothers & Barnum & Bailey Circus. Circus Vargas is not on the same level of RBBBC but it is just as professional. This is a family run business. \n\nWe attended on a day when there was only about 50 persons in attendance. Mostly families. More seats than people but the performance was just as good for one and a half hours. The acts were from Latin and Central America and performed very well. They try very hard getting the audience involved. The whole show is fun. The place, tent,  and restroom facilities  are set up well for those who may have disabilities and/or handicapped.\n\nThe blue tent is clearly seen from afar. The only distraction was that from the outside the tent was a bit dusty but that is understandable since we are in the desert. Also, the bleachers look very uncomfortable and are placed at the rear of the circular tent arena. The most expensive seats around the circle are the most comfortable. No animals. Just excellent human talent and skill. Get a ticket and go! If you have doubts leave them and go with your best intentions - they will be met."
0,"This is another bad restaurant by a LLC with big aspirations.  I only wish their business ambitions were in pace with their product, but it's not even close. \n\nWhen I initially had walked in to the restaurant I really did like the dark hued deep red tones, and the geometric lines of the interior, but that was probably the high point. \n\nThe restaurant was also dead empty, and that should've been a warning sign, but we were starving! \n\nI ordered the Kalbi, Bulgogi, and beef tongue. Unlike other Korean BBQ's, San Toki (\""snow bunny\"") only gives you a whopping three side dishes, and any additional side dishes were $2 to $6 more. Even rice was charged. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for water and chopsticks. Now, is it wrong to charge more for these items? No, it's not, but people accustomed to traditional Korean BBQ's are going to have different expectations, and this business has failed to manage expectations of what a Korean BBQ typically is. Not only did they not live up to price, but they failed on portions. The kalbi was cut away from the bone and cut up into tiny little cubes which was great for presentation, but it's a wasted unnecessary step. All 3 of these dishes failed to feed two of us, yet alone 4 people. \n\nNow onto flavor, I have no idea how this place can survive other than from unsuspecting out-of-town naive tourist who have no idea what Korean BBQ should taste like, but I suppose that's their proposed business model that they plan on surviving on because taste and quality isn't it. They couldn't even deliver on the sauces because they  tasted so bad because they decided to do some sort of \""FUSION\"" gochujang type sauce instead.\n\nAfter coming to this restaurant, I wonder if their other restaurants were also as bad as this one. If they are, I could only assume if they're as superficial as this restaurant they won't be able to expand outside of Vegas or sustain itself unless they get their act together. I also wonder if any of the principle's behind this company even work at any of the restaurants. I highly doubt it.\n\nThe biggest insult was when the person who appeared to be the manager inquired with a \""how did we like the food\"", and I knew that once I opened my mouth, everybody else would want to sink down into their seat, but I had to be honest and say \""this is the worst Korean BBQ I have ever had\"". His response was \""well, that's unfortunate, but that's odd because we have the TOP KOREAN CHEF IN LAS VEGAS\"". Of course I laughed at that, and I now take pity on Las Vegas for having such bad Korean food because if that's the best Vegas has, I feel for the people of Nevada. He had also asked what Korean BBQ restaurants have I been to and I mentioned a half dozen in K-town, and the guy I was with just got back from a business trip from Korea, and he was treated out to Korean BBQ by one of the dept heads of one of the divisions of Hyundai. I guess after that response, it was fairly reasonable that our response seemed somewhat or slightly valid."
4,"Many of my clothes are bought from forever 21 either online or in-store. \n\n(1) its affordable and cheap though the quality isnt that great it is what you pay for.  \n(2) It has a great selection:   I love how they have casual and formal clothes and even basics clothing.  They have accessories, shoes, flats, hats, purses, and belts.  \n\nI love how their store isnt so huge nor small & the store is always very neat and the workers are always willing to help you out.  I have received many compliments of the clothes I wear and they always wonder where I have bought my clothes and I tell them \""forever21.\""  \n\nYou can find rings, necklaces, and earrings for under $3.  Most of the bracelets are about $3 or more and they do have a cute selection of accessories! I love it and sometimes you just have to chose wisely what looks cheap and what you can do to make it look more expensive.  \nI never bought any shoes or flats there, from what I have seen nothing they have is my style.  \nHowever, there were a couple of times where I feel like the clothes they carry looks trashy and all torn up & im like wth? Also, where everything was sparkly and nothing they had was grabbing my attention that I had to stop shopping at F21 for a while. LOL. \n\nOverall though, I do love shopping at forever21 and I would shop here until the day I think it no longer has my style of clothing."
1,"Our group sat on the patio at lunch time, and the atmosphere was lovely.  Service was friendly but a bit slow.  Note that their lunch menu is quite small and simple.  It consists of a few sandwiches and salads.  I tried the steak sandwich, which was good but not mind-blowing by any means.  The sandwich came with kettle chips, and fries are extra.  Dessert consisted of double chocolate cookie, chocolate chip cookie, chocolate bouchons, and a \""fat boy\"" ice cream \""sandwich\"".  I place quotes around \""sandwich\"" because our waitress said it was a sandwich, the menu says it's a sandwich, but when it arrived at the table, it was an ice cream bar on a stick - the kind you get from an ice cream truck.  Vanilla with chocolate and chopped peanuts.  It was also cracked, like someone sat on it.  So, I don't understand this at all.  On a brighter note, the chocolate bouchons were heavenly - like molten chocolate cake bites.\n\nAs far as French bistros go, I would prefer to go to Boulud at Wynn."
0,"My husband and I took the Grand Canyon Tour that stops at Bright Angel Lodge for three hours. Our morning started out ok, we were picked up at 7 from our hotel on a small shuttle that drove us to a parking lot where the big \""luxury\"" bus picked us up. An African American male that checked us in the big bus was very rude to me, he asked me rudely to get off the bus and let the rest of the group of the person in front of me to come first. He touched my arm and pushed me to turn around. After the other driver (Caucasian male) who constantly said he has been doing this for over 20 years started out nicely as well then his patience started going downhill. He reminded us about 20 times to make sure we are at a Bright Angel lodge at 3:15 or else he would leave us. He made fun of a group of Asian tourists that were part of our bus that appeared lost once we arrived at the Bright Angel lodge. He was making negative remarks about their behavior, making them look dumb and letting he whole bus now about this. I felt like an elementary school student the whole time as he appeared to treat us like such. On the way back we make many, many different spots to the hotel of each of the passengers! It is super boring the way back. We stopped at this stinky dirty gas station to use the restrooms. The food provided was ok, just enough to hold me from starving all day. The only positive is that the movies provided were entertaining and that the bus was not crowded. Next time, we are driving and not taking any tours!!"
1,"Service was borderline passable.  Nothing spectacular for the price, but nothing to really complain about either.  Standard bread and pickles on table to start off but if you want pickles bread and coleslaw go to Moishes especially for the after 9 specials..  \nStarted with a salad which was extremely disappointing and kind of insulting.  it looked and tasted exactly like the pre shredded lettuce bags I get at Loblaws.  The sauce, despite the waitresses claim of being fantastic and popular no better than what is found in the grocery aisles.  \nI ordered mignons of beef diane which was good.  Perfectly cooked rare, but both the sauce and steak tasted too buttery, and suggested wine pairing with dinner wasn't a hit and didn't go well with the mushrooms and sauce.  If I could have gone back I would have saved myself a few bucks and pick something cheaper as this was not a $50 dish.\nAll in all, I left somewhat disappointed as the food was nothing exciting, and nothing I can't get elsewhere for cheaper.  I don't mind paying a premium on food prices if justified with a nice setting or top notch serve such as Queue de cheval  and it was nice eating in the old port environment.  I'm glad I was dining with some friends and total damage was around $90  instead of ~$200 if I was with my fiance, at which point I would have left absolutely disappointed and annoyed."
2,The Pollo Bocadillo chix sandwich was surprisingly decent.  Chix tenders had too much batter and too salty.  Service is friendly and attentive.
3,"Cheap. and Nice place if you go to the restaurants , They also have these places in food-courts and the food is about the same. Decent"
3,Pizza is their strength.
3,"Although I live nowhere near Summers, I happened to notice their produce stand on the way to an event at the Humane Society, so I stopped on my way home.  Lots of produce, of course, and a good selection of pickled and canned items as well.\n\nI found the staff to be so friendly, offering samples of a few different fruits and even going to the trouble to point out that they had less expensive lemons than the locally grown variety I was purchasing.  Both varieties of dates I purchased were excellent, although, why do they have to look like big 'ole cockroaches?  Can't someone engineer a more attractive fruit?\n\nAnyhow, definitely worth a stop if you live in the neighborhood.  Keep in mind their prices are for cash payment.  Using a card will cost you more, but I'm not sure how much."
2,"I've had good experiences here in the past, but my most recent visit was disappointing.\n\nWe came around 7pm on a Saturday night, and the place was packed. There is no hostess stand, so we and some other couples who who had walked in stood awkwardly by the door waiting to be greeted. It took 5-10 minutes before the hostess came over.  Customers should be greeted and welcomed when they walk in! \n\nAfter waiting a while, we were able to grab seats at the bar for dinner. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. We started with truffle frites which were amazing. We both ordered soups with our dinner, but neither soup was hot.  My husband was disgusted with his greasy lukewarm bacon potato soup. I had butternut squash soup which tasted good, but room temperature soup just isn't very satisfying.  The V burger was tasty and cooked perfectly; however, there was far more bread than burger.  I would have preferred a bun or a burger that fit the size of the bread.\n\nI'll probably give this place another try since I've had good experiences in the past, but my latest visit has left a bad taste, so it will probably take some time before I'm back."
2,"Championing itself as \""Scotland's national newspaper\"", The Scotsman seems to be somewhat geographically confused. Anywhere north of Queensferry, west of Linlithgow, or south of Baberton doesn't seem to count.\n\nWith the country's other broadsheet, The Herald, being as Glasgow-centric in it's coverage as The Scotsman is towards Edinburgh, it is a shame that there isn't really a Scottish national daily that genuinely covers the news and current affairs of the country as a whole. That is unless you count The Daily Record, which would just be stupid.\n\nApart from that, politically fairly neutral, with some decent articles but a slightly old-fashioned and out of touch feel, it's a passable if uninspiring read."
2,"Love the flavored crust! On that note, that's about all to love besides the pretty cheap prices. On my first visit, I called ahead for pick up, and when I arrived I still had to wait an extra 10 minutes or so. This was around 5pm so I guess its a busy time on a Saturday. Being that its a new location I'm hoping their quality and service will get better over time."
0,Absolutely horrible customer service. This location is just off the I -17 freeway so I imagine the get lots of travelers. On my way from Flagstaff to Phoenix we coordinated our stop with Starbucks so everyone could get coffee and go to the bathroom. Upon arrival a Starbucks staff member indicated we could not use the bathroom because he just mopped both bathrooms. I asked if we could take paper towels and dry on the the bathroom floors so that we could all go to the bathroom and he refused. He told us no and to go to Pizza Hut 2 restaurants down.  I was appalled by his actions and lack of service.  We decided not. To purchase a coffee and left.
0,Still run by lazy ass people who do the bare minimum to earn their bare minimum.  Dont EVER think this is a quick trip to avoid Bashas or Frys...just go DIRECTLY to those stores.  The time you saved is non-existent as lazy ass employees do nothing to help one find anything in the store or answer simple questions.  this place sucks.
3,"What I did:\nWent in, Checked in with Yelp, Got a free side by checking in with the app, ordered a combo plate, and a baklava. Ate. Ordered two Baklavas\n\nWhat I should have done:\nSat in my car, Bought the yelp deal 15 for 20, Went in, ordered a combo plate, not used the free side, stack on baklavas till it totalled to 20 dollars. Drove off with a satisified belly and a bag full of sweet sweet baklava \n\nMan oh man if i had employment near the strip i'd totally eat at Stephano's a lot more often. I've been meaning to hit up Stephano's after trolling their booth at the 89XXX elite event what...two years ago? Yeah two years ago, it's been a while with Operation Enduring Freedom and all i just never had a chance to go.\n\nWhoa the food is good. The Gyro is a lamb and beef blend. Would have loved for it to just be lamb but they do it right. They slice the gyro meat from the huge rotating hunk of gyro meat then they grill it some more to char the sides just to give it a fresher taste. Bravo guys and gals at Stephano's BRAVO!!\n\nTheir options of condiments is just Aladeen...Sriracha AND Tapatio?!? \n\nIf gas prices were cheaper I would GLADLY make the trek toward the UNLV campus just to grab me a Gyro."
3,"Came to this place on a Thursday night with a few people. I was in town, from California, visiting for a few days and had heard a lot of good things about the Great Dane.\nTo start things off, I had the Crop Circle Wheat beer, which was pretty darn good. We also ordered some cheese curds, which were pretty amazing. For my entree, I had the Mad City meatloaf. It was probably one of the better meatloaves I've had in a long, long time. It was seasoned very well and the fried onions and peppers on top were a nice combination of flavor.\nCrop Circle Wheat + Mad City meatloaf + cheese curds = a full tummy.\nDefinitely a place to check out if you're visiting. Next time I'm in town, I'm gonna have to try a few more of their brews."
2,"The atmosphere is really cool and I love the concept but there are a few things that will probably keep me from coming back here. They are as follows:\n\n1) We had a fairly large group of people occupying an area in between two of the large couch areas (at one of the fire pits) but could not get a server to serve us. We assumed it was because we weren't actually sitting in any of the couches. That's pretty lame.\n\n2) Since we had no server, we were required to go to the bar for drinks. This was quite the task considering the bartenders would not serve you unless you were sitting IN a bar chair/stool. I'm not new to the bar scene so I know for a fact that almost all bars will serve the annoying hoard of people hovering behind those seated at the bar. (Also, I'm not ugly....so I know it wasn't because of that).\n\n3) They apparently HERD you into a line at the bar between two ropes where you have to either order beer or one of their weird concocted drinks. I felt like livestock.\n\n4) The food is eh. \n\n5) Parking sucks. Just like every other \""Complimentary Valet\"" having restaurant in the area. \n\nI'll give it another whirl but if the valet farts in my car like they did to some other Yelper I might just avoid The Yard altogether."
0,Delivery girl needs to learn some basic etiquette.
1,"Meh.\n\nYou'd expect a brand new, snazzy hotel to wow you with a marvelous buffet...it was mediocre at best.\n\nMy worst experience was getting burned by a VERY hot metal serving spoon right in front of a server, dropping it, and him giving me a condescending look. Really? \n\nThe waitress tried to get us drunk by putting 3/4 champagne in our mimosas...it's not bad, but I'd like to also taste the orange juice.\n\nFood included Asian, Mexican, breakfast and roast beef with the works. There were no tags or signs, since they hand write it on the glass covers...hope you can read their writing. \n\nAnd as for the dessert? 3 kinds of oatmeal cookies, chocolate whoopie (tasteless) pie, flan, and ice cream. I read the desserts were amazing.........where have people been comparing these to, hometown buffet? They were, at most, subpar.\n\nNot worth the $40+ per person + $6 drink."
1,"I know that frozen yogurt is the healthier option for a frozen dairy treat. It is not jammed pack with calories, as long as you don't go nuts on the toppings, but Tasti D-Lite was lacking in creaminess. Even though, fro-yo is a less guilty choice, I still want it to feel like a treat. The iciness of the product reminded me more of like a sorbet. Although it still incorporates the do it yourself method, the flavor options are lacking compared the competition, but was pricier."
4,"What a find! We had a big party of 11 people (with 5 kids). but that did not stop the Mr Mama staff from making sure we were taken care of. They were accommodating, very friendly, nice, and hospitable.\n\nWe ordered pancakes, omelets, breakfast steaks, etc. All the portions were generous and delicious. Next time I am in Vegas, I will not waste time looking for a place on the Strip. Mr. Mama has won me over!"
3,"Always heard good things about this place, so I had to try it for myself. I love the pricing of this place, for the size of the sandwich, I didn't mind paying $6-ish at all. Though the line can be long, Earl of Sandwich has come up with a pretty efficient way of handling their crowds. As for the sandwiches themselves, the ingredients they use are fresh and the meats are moist. The only thing I wish they had was more of a variety of sandwiches to choose from. \n\nI ordered the Original 1762, the roast beef was delicious and moist. And the horseradish sauce wasn't super strong but a good ratio of creamy to spicy. I also went a second time and got the Full Montagu. I'm a condiment person and the mustard wasn't cutting it, so I added more dijon mustard and tabasco. Out of the two, I enjoyed the Original 1762 the best."
1,"This place was just okay for me. As a vegan, there were hardly any options for me and what I did get definitely left something to be desired. I also spent way more money than I expected to ($2.50 to add a tiny glob of guac? Really?).\n\nI did love the salsas, though, and the hot sauce is very tasty. I would go back and just munch on the chips and dips that they bring you, but I wouldn't order anything off the menu. I've had better Mexican food for cheaper."
1,I have come here twice and basically it seems like your typical generic Vegas nightclub with a few additional minuses. They won't give you tap water and charge $9 for bottled water. Very claustrophobic dance floor. The main issue for why I won't come back is they have a major theft issue which security doesn't seem to take seriously. 3 out of 4 of my group had our phones pick pocketed and many others in our vicinity as well. Security guards rolled their eyes when we told them. There are many better options to choose in Vegas so I have no plans to come back.
0,"This airport is a joke.\n\nSo there's one level for both departures and arrivals?  I can only imagine how cluttered this place becomes during peak-hours.  Once you're inside, you realize arrivals go upstairs and each terminal has their security checkpoint.  Why is this so complicated?  And the North Curb and South Curb?  Why?\n\nThe whole place, inside and out, appears to be very cluttered.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by spending many years at JFK and LGA."
1,"Need more seating, very cramped and difficult to study/work.   The pastries are dry, but the espresso is good enough.   I hope the location in Regent Square has more space."
3,Order fish and shrimp grilled for tacos!!! So good! We sat outside today and they had two men playing authentic music. Great atmosphere :)
3,"Best selection of wine\n\nBefore total wine was open you had lees, and that became stale. Then total wine opened up and raised the bar for liquor stores in Vegas.\n\nThis store is pretty neat, well layer from country to grape and if your not sure what your looking for, the staff have plenty of educational material that can help.\n\nI will say the range of international alcohol and non alcohol is quite impressive. It's always nice to jump in and get some Australian Ginger beer!\n\nAlso a few times a month they have wine classes, I think you can book them over the phone or in store"
2,"Yep, this place is crazy busy.  And like many observations confirm....the appeal of the basement dwelling, exhaust fume-smelling, valet-adjacent eatery escapes me as well - but I keep on going.  The truth is - the singles scene, convenience, taste and value of a Kona Grill happy hour has many people coming back as well.  I was just there on a Monday night - and couldn't believe how busy it was.  And considering the number of reviews this place has is another case in point. \n\nThe sushi rolls (california, crab and tuna) are surprisingly good - not amazingly good, but more like \""wow...I can't believe this is $2 sort of good.\""  A friend I usually go with is a calamari junkie - and always orders her own.  I guess it's that good.   I usually get the Maui wraps (i think that's what it's called) with your choice of either halibut or chicken in some kind of slaw - it's great.   \n\nService leaves a bit to be desired.  It's usually pretty bad either because they are so slammed, or because we have some stuck-up blondie broad pissed that she actually has to lift a finger.  Either way it's still a good deal to check out, and I'll be going back again."
1,"Mastro's price point would lead one to believe the service and meal would be of the best quality. i'm afraid my experience would say this is not true. As a last night meal in  town for the next month , my husband and I had dinner at Mastro's. We had been there many times ,but this night my crab cake was not even warm ( they said it should be room temp) really? Then the porterhouse steak steak for two we ordered came out as a porterhouse steak for one we could share! Our service was below what anyone would expect and there is not a reason in the world to go there when many other options are out there. You must have to be a celebrity to get service that  any normal couple would hope to get for a  price point in this place."
3,"This is a place that isn't super cheap, but the food makes up for the price. The turkey burger was AAAAMAZING. I did a build your own burger w/ a lettuce wrap. I didn't expect just a hunk of lettuce with the burger on top, but the turkey burger itself made up for it. Service was great and the sweet potato fries are to die for!"
4,"Was on the way home and remembered to finally stop by this joint and take it off my \""To Do List\"".....thank God I did!  It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!\n\nI was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.\n\nI browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!\n\nI couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.\n\nI saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.\n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!\n\nThe Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.\n\nThe Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.\n\nThe owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said \""See you soon Peter!\""......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.\n\nWill I return?  This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!  Now, back to the gym to burn off these calories."
1,every time i order from them it takes more than 30 min and i live less than a mile away. my order is always right minus one time that was wrong
3,"I wish this place was in Chicago!  Loved everything about this place!  Loved how little and homey it was.  Especially loved the pizza, the crust was nice and fluffy without being too much crust.  The toppings tasted fresh.  We ordered a large special pizza for the four of us and after tasting how delicious our pizza was, we decided to order another one :)  My only complaint about this place is that there is not one in Chicago!"
0,"If you enjoy microscopic mediocre hot dogs, then this place is for you. Costco's hot dogs are better and sell some called \""Caspers,\"" that will rock your world.\n\nI'm shocked this place is still in business with the crappy product they are selling. A normal sized bun with an anorexic hot dog in the middle. Save your money and go anywhere else."
3,"So, I try to take it easy on the carbs because I'm a carb whore. But, I got their bagels and lox and I could not resist the bagel. The lox I resisted, it wasn't authentic enough for me. Typically, I'd eat half a bagel because it's like 500 calories already. But, I was like screw it, it's worth the 1000 calories! The bagel is so soft and chewy and soaks up the cream cheese as if their lovers. I think this is the best bagel I've ever had in my life!"
2,"I don't think there's much to say that hasn't been said already. A recent visit revealed a long line to get in but if you're patient, it can move quickly. I don't remember being asked to open my bag last time I was there, but no big deal. Like with all big venues, the prices for everything is inflated, but you're probably there for a specific reason, so it's all part of the experience...right? I guess. Acoustics aren't that great, but it is what it is..."
1,The wings were disappointing; not crispy and just okay. That is all I tried. It was a take out and the service was good. That's all I got to say right now.
2,"This is the Sugar Factory flagship store and has just about every Sugar Factory product there is (including jeans and swimwear which I thought was a bit odd). They even have a few amazing (and addictive) edible items that you can't get at the other stores. Beware though, this place gets CROWDED especially at nights and on weekends and while the counter staff is good, it gets overwhelming just being in there. If you're from out of town (or not), my advice if you just need a souvenir or a milkshake... Go to Planet Hollywood and get a coupon book from the Miracle Mile customer service desk. For the last couple of months, there's been a 20% coupon in there that is valid for the Sugar Factory store at Planet Hollywood (not valid at the Paris location). It's good for the shakes/cakes/couture pops/etc. Hey, if you're gonna spend $25 on a lollipop, at least get some kind of discount, right?"

0,"I just attended a $90 special prix-fixe dinner party at this dreadful restaurant. It was one of the worst meals I've ever had. It cost us $90 a head for just an appetizer, salad and main course -- no dessert or beverage of any sort. Maybe that would've been ok if the food was delicious but it wasn't special. And the entree was horrible. On top of that, service was slow. We were seated by 8:30 p.m. and couldn't wait to pay our bill and leave by 10:30 p.m.\n\nThe meal started with an antipasto appetizer sampling that gave us each one little meatball, a small slice of pizza, and a slice of bruschetta (chopped tomatoes on a small slice of Italian bread). \n\nFrom there, we proceeded to the cesar-ish salad, which was acceptably dressed but not amazing. Plus, the croutons were little rocks. \n\nAs for the entree, we had a choice between chicken or a pork chop. The pork  chop sounded like a better value dollar-wise but it ended up being a huge chunk of meat with just a dot of veggie puree spooned into the center of the plate. No one sitting around me finished their main course. I didn't either.  \n\nI'm here attending a convention and am sorely disappointed because the fancy food in Vegas is supposed to be good. If you're at the Manadalay Bay, there are plenty of other brand name restaurants here to try. Skip Lupo. If you're on a budget, there's an all-you-can eat buffet place that costs about 30 bucks, which is probably a good option for a group of people who might have various eating issues. \n\nPersonally, I've had two meals at one of the lower priced restaurants, Red White and Blue, where a hamburger will still set you back $15 to $18 -- but the food and service are good. Check out my review for that place!"
2,"I want to start by saying that I love this place! The food, the service and ambiance is fantastic. I do have a complaint however...I feel that management does not listen to customer feedback. Since menu changes seem to be regular it's tough on consumers that fall in love with menu items and expect what they've had before. Since I've been going to LGO they discontinued the white chocolate macadamia cookie, they also stooped making the chocolate chip walnut cookie, and changed the bread for the Cubano Hot Press sandwich to a ciabatta which does not do that sandwich justice from the sour dough they used to have. These are just a few things that I have repeatedly asked about and I get the same reply from the staff, they totally agree and tell me they hear that a lot. Sooooo....you would think something would change but nothing ever does. :("
0,"Don't count on this service - I recall them being pretty good 3-4 ago but things have changed.  They are difficult to get a hold of them and the rates quoted on their website aren't guaranteed even with a confirmed reservation.  Although their automated phone message says all calls are answered within 5 rings, the pickups are generally voice mail I've had much difficulty over the past few years in getting responses back.  Even online reservations are not responded to in a timely manner, leaving you hanging for a few days to even know if you've got an acknowledged reservation.\n\nI just had a trip with them and I called to 2 days after making the reservation to confirm - quoted rate was $41 + $5 surcharge.  My flight arrival was delayed an hour but I was contacted upon arrival and notified that cars were ready to pick me up after I had retrieved my luggage.  When I arrived home, the charge was $81 before tip.  I contacted customer service today and was told they had to contract my trip out to another service which has different prices.  Euro Way's inability to fulfill a confirmed reservation shouldn't be the customer's problem - it's should be a business decision on their part.  They should either eat the difference or not confirm a reservation if they can't fulfill.\n\nFind someone more reliable."
3,"I still think Monta is tasty, but it's just not as tasty as I used to think it was.\n\nWhile Monta isn't my first choice anymore, I don't have any qualms on eating here. My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.\n\nThe Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.\n\nA couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.\n\nAnd of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles."
0,terrible.
4,"Great food and fast service.  The chips and salsa were tasty and spicy.  We loved how the carnitas had little fat on it.. Most places will just serve mostly fat, we got 100% meat.  It's our new favorite place to go and take out of towners looking for Mexican food."
2,"First off.. if you open at 11 then the hostess should be ready to seat customers(we arrived at 1115.) We honestly waited to be seated for 10 minutes and there was plenty of seating. Then this group walks in and the hostess shows up and seats them immediately..WTF!!!!!! (why the face) that group didn't even have the courtesy to tell the hostess \""they were here first\"" and the hostess new we had been waiting. I want so badly to give it 1 star based on that incident but those chili fries were good. \n  I will continue to preach this... IT\""S a HAMBURGER not a filet in between a bun.. so why the prices. Don't get me wrong it was good.. I just don't get the pricing on the hamburgers these days."
0,"ok, I have tried the website,completed the survey, very conscientously I might add,then at the end some dumb glitch won't take it! Could they be screening out the \""negative\"" remarks? Well, I went in to the Subway at 8877 N. 107th Ave in Peoria AZ for lunch. Had coupon,got my sandwich,filled my drink cup. Went out to the car to eat. Came back in for refill of tea, to which a young male employee says to me, \""That will be $1\"".  I says \""Oh you charge for refills now?\"" He says,\""I was just told it would be $1\"". Embarrassed!!Gave him back his cup of tea&got the h$%%# out of there!Called mgr later who was apologetic, saying no we don't charge for refills if you haven't left the property. She said \""Come in and we will buy you a meal.\"" I thought cool! But haven't been back. IDK, just not worth taking the chance that overzealous dude would do same thing. They can keep their comp meal. Too bad - I liked Subway. Now I don't want to go to any."
2,"OK, having read the hot/cold reviews on Sapna and having a free Sunday to spend with my sweet baboo...off we went. \n\nFirst of all...service issues listed in prior reviews are mostly true. This is not a \""get 'em in, get 'em out\"" kind of place, so we didn't see our waiter that often. I was prepared for a slow experience, so it didn't bother me...much. That said, I do want a cup of coffee more frequently than every 20 minutes. Our server mentioned that a fresh pot was being brewed, so I understood the delay for the first cup. When he came out of the kitchen and refreshed all the cups at the other table, I was already itchin' for my second cup...DENIED! Didn't even come near our table to check on our caffeine level 8(\n\nWe both ordered brunch specials. I had the much bally-hooed pumpkin pancakes, which didn't taste all that pumpkin-y. I haven't yet decided if that is good or bad. The cream cheese/walnut topping was awesome and they were not skimpy with it. The pancakes were moist and delish. The leftovers (which didn't really fit into the chinese leftover box I was given) will be wonderful tomorrow a.m., I'm sure!\n\nHubby had a baked breakfast casserole. It smelled delish and he claims it was wonderful. It had spinach, chorizo, egg, tomato and cheese (and other stuff i'm sure) and was baked. It looked a bit runny, but after mixing it all together and slathering it on top of the home fries (which he claimed were good), it lost its runny appearance. Go figure!\n\nI felt that the room could have used some sound deadening, as the group at the other table was a bit loud, but the front door was open and the street noise was non-existent. Cute atmosphere...all IKEA, all the time!\n\nOur check was exactly $20 without tip/tax, so I felt like it was a successful outing. Great weather, great food, good (if not slow) service. \n\nI look forward to a return visit to try other menu items, as many looked like stuff right up my alley!"
3,"We had to see boobs in Vegas, and while this was a more expensive option, it was entertaining. The performers were great and the hula-hoop school girl amazed me. Very talented people, of course, but left expecting a little something more."
2,"Insert Coins is an okay way to start the night, but not somewhere I'd spend the majority of the night. It's a good casual spot to start the night and usually the first place we'll hit up on the weekend. Come here early enough and there's no cover, which is nice. However, it's not a place I'd willingly pay cover to get into. I love video games as much as the next person, but not enough to have to pay to get in.\n\nThe vibe is relaxed, despite the music and club look of the venue. Prices are reasonable. However, with the many options on Fremont East, the novelty of Insert Coins can only take it so far."
2,"Beautiful stadium, especially at night. Try the Arizona Club in the second deck, right field...your game ticket gets you a seat over looking the field. $34.95/ gets you a terrific buffet, served on white linen tablecloth with all the trimmings."
1,"I was kind of disappointed with this place.  The service was good, maybe because I went on opening day, or maybe it really is that good all the time - friendly employees, and the food came out relatively quickly.  But I wasn't impressed with the food.\n\nI ordered the brisket sandwich, with sweet potato fries and their \""delicious creamed corn\"", and really wasn't impressed with any of it.  The brisket was slightly tough, not bad, but not tender and flavorful like I was hoping.  The BBQ sauce was decent, but not as rich as I was expecting.  The creamed corn, which is apparently their featured side, was about 80% country gravy (or something similar) combined with a few chunks of corn.  The sweet potato fries were a little too sugary for my taste, and could have been cooked for a little longer.\n\nAll together, the sandwich, two sides, and a cream soda came out to a little over $15.  If they drop their prices, I may consider going back, after giving them some time to settle in, but as of now, I'm just not impressed."
4,"As far as I know, the only place in Pittsburgh that offers hand-pulled noodles (pulled right in front of you!) and soup dumplings, both of which are amazingly delectable. Heck, this restaurant is likely the only location in this side of Pennsylvania doing what they are doing!"
0,"This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty, the happy hour cocktail was great, and the edamame was perfectly salted. And even though our server was a newbie, she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu Qs.\n\nUnfortunately, none of this matters because I got food poisoning. I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken. Worst 48 hours of my life. I'll never return."
0,"Its about time this place got put on blast.\n\nIf you go to this venue for one of their events, in my case \""What Happened Wednesday?\"", you will be severely disappointed. Repping drink specials at $3 for well drinks, draft, and bottled beers, you couldn't really go wrong. Until it comes to the point of closing your tab. When I did go to check out, I was charged nearly $30 for a 3 drink tab. If we all get our math done correctly, this comes to around $9. Unfortunately for everyone in the place, you happened to select a drink where if you're a pretty girl, you're charged $3. Otherwise, you're coughing up $9 a pop. Not to mention that you're charged for a drink you didn't even purchase (I was charged for 4 drinks, and only purchased 3).\n\nI'm not one to complain about rip-offs, if you go to a bar normally you should know what to expect. But this was RIDICULOUS. My only advice, ask a bartender how much you are going to be charged for a drink before you order it. I may sound cheap, but I'd at least like to know what I'm paying for. \n\n1 star for being a joke of a bar."
2,"Don't fret if anybody walks into the lobby with a shoulder holster and weapon. It's totally cool here, and it goes fashionably with a nine iron.  I do like this place, but I don't love this place.  I like the history of this hotel, and find the aesthetics and the architecture appealing.  They maintain the grounds well.  Croquet anybody?  I appreciate the fact that they take the history of this hotel into account when updating and remodeling.  I've had nothing but good experiences with the customer service.  I love the box of chocolates you get in your room.  French Press coffee for the win!  The rooms are well appointed, and I do love the large showers.  There are several pools to choose from.  There are nice, but overpriced, restaurants and bars.  Is it just me who has trouble with the layout? I do nothing but walk around in circles trying to get to my car.  They have the two parking areas, and neither is very convenient to the rooms I have stayed in.  I sometimes have to attend to my accounts for night shift work, and wandering around a deserted property at midnight is not super awesome.  And they won't let you use the parking lot right by the entrance unless you valet.  Boo! I don't know, there really isn't anything I don't like about this place...I mean, it's nice...but nothing really differentiates The Biltmore from other Hilton Resorts in Phoenix, other than the history and because \""Waiting to Exhale\"" was filmed here.  Maybe my expectations are too high or I need to stay in a villa."
2,"I've been here a few times, I usually order the Medditeranean plate, it comes with hummus, baggett toasts, stuffed grape leaves and a grape tomato salad. I like it; I don't like, crave it, but it does come out quick, usually, when I order it.\n\nThe other day I ordered something new, The roasted veggie sandwich on fococcia bread. The served it with sweet potato instead of eggplant. It was, again, ok, nothing I would rave about. Service was crazy slow that day. We were there precisely one hour... we ordered at 1:20, and received our food at about 12:00. I was hoping for a quick lunch, but my hopes and dreams were soon shattered....\n\nNow, I have never tried their macaroons, though I'm sure they are amazing because that's what everyone raves about. And I haven't had their breakfast......So, this review is based on the few experiences I've had thus far. They just haven't blown me away enough for a 4 or 5 star rating. Hopefully soon, I can update my review after a few more goes....but, we'll see......"
4,"With a beautiful new remodel it's totally necessary for an updated review! It's no surprise I love this museum. I love Andy Warhol, I love his work and I love that he's from Pittsburgh!\n\nThey've remodeled the museum so that you start at the top with Andy's earlier years and work down through his life and career. I don't know if somehow I missed it before, but I'd never seen many of the pictures and facts of his very early life and family growing up in Pittsburgh. It was so cool to see him as a child and learn about his whole family. I truly loved reading about how much his parents supported his artist talents.\n\nI also loved seeing more of his earlier works, when he was doing retail ads. I know I remember seeing some of this before at the museum, but maybe it wasn't as clearly marked and displayed as it is now.\n\nOf course there's still the classics, like the silver cloud room and the screen printed works that are a must see. I LOVE the new lobby with the silver colors and replica of the couch from his Factory days. Great photo opp!\n\nI like that the cafe is upstairs now, although it seems that they've cut down on options? But the gift shop is amazing! So much larger, with even more quirky selections. I'd come here just for the gift shop to buy a gift (or a little something for myself!). \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh this museum is a MUST. Although it is not for the faint of heart. Keep in mind there is some not so G rated materials aka I once checked out a very scandalous special exhibit here! But it really is a crown jewel in our fair city and should be visited by tourists and locals alike!"
2,"Not very impressed by the service and food. First, the skinny side of the food is loaded with sugars and toppings which are not healthy. For being a newer restaurant, you would think the service would be top notch to get the word out. Anyway, when we entered, I made it a point to say it was my first time because I did not understand if we should seat ourselves or order first. The lady was not friendly and could not answer detailed questions about the menu. The food was fair but the salad had heavy dressings. There is noting unique about this place. Meh..."
2,"We picked this place for my friends Birthday.  The decor is nice, very low tables inside and high tables in the Patio. We had around 10 people in our party and were sited in the middle of the restaurant in a kind of 'living room' setting. Very comfortable. The waiter was nice and attentive. \n\nThey offered chips and salsa right away and refilled it when it was gone. Generous portion with 3 types of salsa. But be careful, they will charge every time. ($6 each)\n\nWe also ordered\n-House Margaritas (Some strong, some watered down... Overall Good taste)\n-Hibiscus Margaritas (Make sure you stir the syrup on the bottom) Good\n-Pineapple upside down shots YUMMY!!! Excellent!\n-Buttery nipple shots (Mehh Ive had better, tasted like straight Kalua)\n-House pineapple infused tequila shots (Very Good)\n\nWe also got the Assortment Small Bites. $16 NOT WORTH IT!\nThe chicken, steak and shrimp skewers are tasty, but VERY small (2 of each).  I have never seen quesadillas SO SMALL in my LIFE!  I think they use the tortillas meant for tacos al Carbon LMAO (google it), cut it in 4 pieces.  The onion rings are not good. The batter is cheap and really greasy, and it just does not go with the Mexican food. \n\nI would come back during happy hour.  It is a nice place to hang out and have a drink, but the food is overpriced and portions are minimal."
2,Amazing outdoor seating area perfect for soaking up some vitamin D.
3,"Delicious and a beautiful dining experience!  Located right on the Casino floor, I picked Javier's as the \""date night\"" spot for mine and my fiance's trip to Vegas for his birthday.  Dimly lit and intimate, this restaurant lives up to the hype.  And of course, they have a killer margarita menu full of all kinds of exotic flavors.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\nWe each had a margarita including one that was laced with jalepenos.  The margaritas are both power packed and unique.  They take some time to create but they are worth the wait.\nWe started with the ceviche de camaron and of course the complimentary chips and salsa.  The table salsa is delectable and we gobbled it in a hurry with our drinks.  The ceviche is super rich in flavor and chunky.  Very tasty.  The serving size is enough to feed 2-3 people comfortably without being overstuffed.\nFor dinner, I ordered the Pollo a la Chipotle.  Warning - if you've loaded up on the chips/salsa and anything else to eat before this, you will feel SUPER full.  This entree is delicious but it's seriously filling and rich in flavor.  The sauce is incredibly creamy and there is tons of it to lather the chicken in.\n\nI passed on dessert because I was super full but I wouldn't doubt that it would be tasty!  Bring someone special here, you can enjoy a lovely candlelit dinner and some good eats while you're at it.  Sit near the door/windows and also people watch at the casino.\n\nAnd of course, the service is exceptional.  You will love the treatment."
0,"We would NEVER stay here again!!  We stayed here using our timeshare points (exchanged through another company), but NEVER AGAIN!\n\n1st -- DON'T BELIEVE IT when they tell you the food across the street at the Casino is \""Sooo Good!\"" ... IT'S Sooo NOT!!  We tried nearly every restaurant in that place (some more than once bc we were STARVING), and it would be hard to even call any them decent, and most were outright gross!!\n\n2nd -- DON'T AGREE to a \""90 minute presentation\""... UNLESS YOU HAVE 4.5 HOURS TO WASTE!!  No Joke, at least 4.5 HOURS!!  We unknowingly did this for a discount on Cirque Du Soleil tickets, NOT FREE tix mind you, just a discount.\n\n3rd -- DON'T LET THEM PUT YOU IN A ROOM they call \""a bit OLDER, but very nice and CLOSER TO THINGS\"" ... this means: \n\n      (a)  NO CURTAINS IN YOUR BEDROOM, so you get a face full of sunshine at 7am EVERY MORNING!!!!!  It's Vegas, we stayed up late and COULD NOT SLEEP IN!!  They didn't care, and I was told to hang a sheet, literally.  \n\n      (b) The \""older\"" WALLS ARE PAPER THIS and our ghetto neighbors were apparently bouncing off the gd walls... WE HEARD EVERYTHING!!\n\n4th -- THERE WAS HAIR in our shower and the spa tub was CRUSTY!!  I wasn't planning on sitting my naked bottom in there anyways, but that really sealed the deal... YUCK!!  Oh, and our sink was clogged so brushing teeth was extra nasty. \n\n5th -- Most resorts have free shuttle service...  BUT NOT THIS ONE!!  The shuttle service by Ritz (another review) was costly... $24 for airport service (TO & FROM) and $10 per day to the strip, $20 for the two of us.  Yeah, some cars rent for $9.99 per day!  Not too bright on our part, huh.  \n\n6th -- INTERNET ACCESS FEES!  How sad & cheap of them.  Starbucks, Peet's, even greasy McDonald's now has free access. Rather than purchase Grandview access, try using your cellphone as a hotspot. \n\nLast -- JUST DON'T STAY HERE AT ALL if you can prevent it!!  Too far from the strip and nothing interesting is out there.  Did I mention the food SUCKS??  Our room SUCKED??  Our bathroom SUCKED??  The Grandview pretty much made out trip to Vegas SUCK!!  \n\nWill try again at a DIFFERENT RESORT."
0,I would give 0 stars if I could. UGH. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! There is a reason why Luxor has low ratings!!! Stay away!!!
0,"When reviewing a Baja or other franchise, typically the review is how it goes for that specific location.  This location of Baja Fresh is awful, whereas most other locations I have been to have been outstanding.\n\nThe wait times are absurd, the staff are rude, the place is dirty, and portion size compared to other Bajas is BS.  Yes, I am nitpicking on this (isn't that what Yelp is for?) but the amount of chips they give you while you wait here is terrible in comparison to other locations - and I came here 3 times to give it the benefit of the doubt over the past 6 months or so.  \n\nIf management here could get it together, I'd become a regular as I am in the area frequently.  Until that happens, paz!"

0,"A Madison tradition for getting wasted before games and such, but the service is HORRIBLE for meals and the inside is dark and gross. Everything is always sticky from spilled booze and the crowd is annoying. There are so many better places in Madison."
1,"I found myself leaving work late last night on the drive home looking forward to a good meal.  Only to find out that my Wife was having dinner with her Mother and I was on my own.  Feeling like something different I start cruising around surprise looking to see if anything new sprang up.  \n\nI remembered seeing the sign for Mei Wei and wondered if they thought maybe they would get more business by varying their namesake by one letter to the popular chain.  Nonetheless I decided to stop in.\n\nI walked in and the the restaurant had a dark mood lit feel, but was actually well decorated.  It also appeared very clean.   I was immediately greeted and the staff was very cordial,  I started looking over a menu to get take out and was offered a recommendation.  \n\nI should have been weary when they offered the Orange Peel Chicken.  but I gave it a chance because they used the word peel and just orange chicken, got an order of egg rolls too just to try.   10 minutes later my food was ready and I was on my way.  I got home and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size and including the egg rolls probably could have fed 2 people.  The food itself unfortunately was mediocre, the usual white rice and crispy meat faire, which isn't bad but for 12.50 I was expecting a bit more.\n\nFood was ok but lacked any sort of flare or appeal, almost wonder if this would be a better lunch destination.  It's official Surprise is culturally bankrupt when it comes to Chinese/Asian food.  I might try it again, but don't hold your breath.\n\nBetter wipe the lipstick off my collar before Pei Wei finds out."
4,MTO is fantastic! Great food and great service! The manager David is awesome! They have both healthy food and comfort food! Great place for kids!  Check this place out you won't be sorry!
0,"We arrived on a late Thursday night and had an absolutely dreadful meal for two sitting at the sushi bar.  The sashimi plate was small. The seaweed salad is frozen, not fresh, and the worst I can ever remember having.  The waitress served us our salad and miso soup after we had already ate the sushi because she said, \""so sorry, they serve so fast.\""  They didnt serve it fast, you served slow.  It isnt hard to make a salad or miso soup quicker than someone else is making sushi.  Especially a salad that is just greens and dressing and a soup that is already made and just broth. The lobster roll for $20 is fake lobster.  We are sitting here in our room at the Hilton feeling sick afterwards.  Shame on you Benihanas for allowing such a sub standard sushi bar in your restaurant."
3,"The disco fries tasted good, but I was a little disappointed in the amount of cheese on them (and not in curd form either). It's very American of me to want more cheese on everything though, especially when the cuts of oxtail were surprisingly large and juicy. If I could change them, I would put curds of cheese, more like the amount found in poutine and shred the oxtail pieces into the gravy to make them easier to eat and share. \n\nMy dining companion had the burger with an egg, bacon, and pimiento cheese on it. It was giant and difficult to hold and eat - I would suggest offering to cut it in two or sending a knife that's up to the challenge out with the burger. I tried a bite -- it was delicious, but very messy due to its size and construction. \n\nI had the chicken and waffles and while I was initially concerned about anise being added to the syrup (I don't like licorice flavors), I tried it and it added a depth of flavor to counteract the sweetness of the syrup while being otherwise unoffensive. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy inside a crispy crust of breading. The waffle was made with cornmeal, which helped make it less like a typical breakfast waffle. The Brussels sprouts were caramelized with bacon. All the flavor profiles on the plate meshed very well."
2,If you could roll up most of Rodeo Drive into a shopping mall then this would be the place.  Unfortunately there really isn't much else but high end stores.  \n\nIt can also be slightly clunky to get through every corner of the mall.\n\nBring cash...plastic can be dangerous!
4,Great. nuff said.
4,"Not only was the room beautiful, the staff was great too. Ariella was very helpful during check in! She made sure we had everything we needed. She even offered us water and gave us a bottle of tooth paste since we forgot to bring one. \nI will defiantly be staying here again thanks to her  great service!"
2,"Their beer is good, but I don't recommend the food. It's like... a food truck sitting outside. I also tried going at 6 (for dinner) and they told me the grill was closed, which doesn't make much sense to me... because that's the exact time you're going to make money off of food. Not 2pm when people are at work, but between 4-10. These guys really should finish the remodeling of this building, too. They seem to have gotten half way there and just quit? These guys do a whole lot of giving away groupons, but groupon is to bring return-customers to a business... and I'm not sure they're getting those return customers because of some of these things I've mentioned. Anyway, I give it 3 stars because the beer is good, and I go refill my growlers every now and then."
0,This is for the miserable excuse for a cafe and it's glum staff. The most depressed tuna melt I have eaten in my life.
2,6 dollars for a large dirty chai which was 1/3 ice. Have these people lost their minds?\n\nGood coffee but way too overpriced.
2,"Prices are fair. It WREAKED of sewage outside on the patio area. So we sat inside.  I ordered the BBQ chicken and my fella ordered the BBQ burger.  Both arrived with virtually NO bbq sauce. I requested some twice from our server until I walked up to get my own at the checkout area.\nAlso, \""flash frying\"" perfectly delicious veggies simply to have them delivered to my table dripping in oil and flavored in lonely salts was a waste of a few bucks.\n\nStep it up"
1,"I was so disappointed. After drooling over these pictures and rave reviews for weeks  I finally drove the ten miles to get my fantasy pizza. Imagine my surprise when they handed me this tiny box weighing almost nothing. I actually asked the waitress if she gave me the right order. Funny, she asked me where i'd heard about the place and I told her the internet, she said \""Yawp (sic) ?..yeah most of those are family or friends, we got 5 stars or somethin'.\"" That explains ALOT!\nGee, good thing me and my husband weren't really hungry, twenty bucks for a snack? Not bad quality but tiny quantity for price. Sauce is kinda raw, undertaste of wine and exactly two nickel sized slivers of  garlic sausage per slice. Cheese is good quality. I see why the place was empty at 7pm on a Saturday. If your single or on a date and don't mind high prices go for it."
1,Good food.  The lunch is a little expensive and this is not a good place for a crowd.  I went with about 12 coworkers for happy hour on a Wednesday night.  They were less than accommodating.  They wouldn't allow tables and chairs to be moved etc.  There were few customers in the restaurant.  They kept saying that they needed to accommodate others...who these others are I have no idea!  Not sure if I'll be back.
4,"sometimes i crave durian and my husband will not let me even BREATHE in his atmosphere if i've had it, let alone buy one from leelee's across the street. so, i LOVE when lee's has the ice cream and, if they don't, i'll get the shake.\n\ni get all the strange fruit shakes.\n\nafter all, i am what nina simone would call a strange fruit. ;)"
2,"Nice concept to differentiate from all the Mexican Food out there.\n\nwe shared a steak quesadilla ($9) and a taco salad ($11).\n\nQuesadilla ok, but too much butter on it.  Taco salad was just average .  . . .the salsa they provide is what makes the salad flavorful.  Not much chicken on salad\n\nHad 2 of their speciality margs.  The rasberry one was incredibly good and the mango was was just ok.  A bit pricey at $9 each, but we had a bygo free coupon.\n\nThe service was good and our server was great.  We had a 10 month old with us and they made sure she was ok.\n\nOverall . . . .just an ok.  Would probably go there for drinks again, but not sure I would do dinner."
3,I'm from the east coast.  Chick-fil-A truly scratches an itch.  I think they fry everything in peanut-oil?\n\nRegardless you need to get breakfast here.  CHIKN MINIS!!!!!!  \n\nSome day I'll finally talk myself into getting a party tray of nuggets just for me.
2,I've never visited their store but they were at the BITE of Las Vegas and I couldnt stop buying their chocolate covered strawberries & apples.\nThey sell them in bouquets like an arrangement of flowers hence the name. Brilliant idea and tasty chocolate.
4,"Contacted Red Mountain Renovations after reading their reviews on here because I needed my bamboo flooring installed.  I have to agree with all of them.  \n\nScott and Alex were great to work with.  They are very personable and flexible.  My moldings didn't come in time for when they were installing my flooring, but they came back when I finally got them and didn't charge me for the extra work as well as time they took to come back out to my house.  They also had the best prices for installation as well.  \n\nI highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a company to install their flooring.  I will definitely be using them again in the future."
4,"Holy...shite.\n\n\nThis place is what I have been searching for...for way too long!!!\nIf you're looking for something that's not Americanized...this is it. This is the place.\n\nThe ONLY downside is, the staff is a bit awkward if you're not Asian. I'm half Asian, but I don't look like it. The bf is very white. They weren't as friendly with us and not as tentative to us. And the waiter was very awkward, like he didn't know what he was doing. \nBut you know what??? It's so freaking good, I don't give a shit!\n\n This is the place the Asian's go to. So - that's your sign.\nWe had -\n\nSpicy beef dry pot\nSpicy lamb pot\nSpicy pork and wonton soup w/ rice noodles\nKung pow shrimp\n\nEverything...EVERYTHING was amazing. Probably some of the best authentic Chinese food I've ever had.\n\nI definitely recommend the pots - if you're looking for something different and full of flavor.\n\nAlso, this place is insanely cheap. We for 4 dishes for $50. That is insane. There was only two of us, but we love leftovers. Most places we go, we pay $60+ for 2 dishes with drinks.\n\nVery clean, very fast and amazing food. I can't wait to go back and bring my posse!!"
4,"growing up I had a one barber who knew me for many years and being new to Las Vegas I was looking for a similar situation where I can say \""I have a barber that I go to\""  after reading the reviews I decided to check them out.  was greeted at the door! there was a considerable wait time as they were busy.  I enjoyed the wait however, watching them work and seeing what they can do, the conversations were hilarious.  I had a feeling of male bonding akin to my childhood experiences.   I was not sure what kind of haircut i wanted and simply told them what I was thinking and they hooked me up with a fresh cut, and cleaned me up with hot lather and straight razor shave.  Cash only!  I will be returning for my future haircuts."
1,Came here on a Saturday night. Supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music. The food is mediocre at best. By pass this place and go to boardwalk Billie's around the corner. Much better bang for your buck.
0,This place should have been knocked down to make room for a real resort. It's half ass in almost every way. The casino stinks like perfume and cigarettes mixed together and none of the 3 restaurants are open after 9pm. The one restraint that is open only serves cold food after 10pm and that is just ridiculous in Vegas. It's not a real resort and can't compete with its neighbors.
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this hotel was for how little I paid on a Saturday night (around $70 total). The room was nice, and the bed was comfortable...I could tell they did some upgrades because everything looked new."
2,"I think this place deserves a 3.5 star. \n\nIve been here about 4 times. The food was consistently good, but it's not something to write home about. The price was on the high side, but it's totally what you expected from this kind of place (the decor is nicer than what it seems from the outside). I really have a mixed feeling about this place. The food is authentic though for the most part, so I guess that's a good change from Americanized Japanese food. \n\nThere was one thing I didn't like; fried salmon roll. The breading was thick and greasy. Otherwise, food was good. The whole experience was good, but there really wasn't a \""wow\"" moment."
3,"Pita Jungle is like a grandparent.  Extremely reliable, always fills you up when you visit, and hasn't changed style in over a decade.  And like a good grandparent, you don't need a reservation to get in, but patience is virtue because sometimes there's a wait...but it's worth it.\n\nPersonally, I love the specials list on menus because they're unique and odds are, you might not see them again.  Yesterday, I ordered the grilled cajun mahi mahi with toasted pita chips and jalepeno cilantro hummus.  Yeah, I know. That was quite an order.  But for $10, it's a great portion and the fish was prepared perfectly!\n\nI highly recommend PJ for lunch and as soon as the server shows up, I highly recommend you order the trio hummus plate along with the tropical tea! What a good start to a good day :)"
4,"What is there  not to love about Costco.. Wish they would come to Casa Grande. Great products, super prices, fast checkout, friendly and helpful employees... etc etc etc."
2,"You landed at McCarran and due to the TSA restrictions you realize dang, I forgot my eye drops and since it's a desert out here your eyes dry out fast. Or you might want to pick up some stuff for the mother of all hangovers you're going to have from exploring the Strip all night. If your cab driver doesn't long haul you through the airport tunnel and goes North instead this Walgreens location might be worth stopping at. It's not on the Strip so you don't pay Strip prices, but it's also a straight drive down Flamingo to the middle of the Strip for easy access to the Flamingo, the Quad, and the Cromwell when your done. And this Walgreens is a 24 hour location so if you had to you can do a one time scrript transfer if you really forgot something you can't be without (but be prepared to wait and wait, and wait some more for the pharamcists to make that happen). \n\n3 Stars. Some people consider any area outside of Summerlin to be sketchy...and yes there are homeless people around. Get in, get out, mind your business and you won't have any issues shopping here."
0,"WOW.  what a let down.  My very first impression of this place: DIRTY.  As I opened the menu, my second thought was, \""EXPENSIVE!\""  was this ice cream made of gold?  I mean, even for Vegas, it was expensive.  \n\nMy husband and I decided to share a sundae.  Overpriced, melty, took like 25 minutes... why??  It's ice cream, not a beer wellington!  Won't be going back."
0,"We were visiting family and I suggested we try an Ethiopian place - so naturally I checked Yelp.  Well I can not disagree more with the reviews!  \nhttp://www.abayrestaurant.com/menu.shtm\n\nThe food at this restaurant was horrible!  The vegetarian sambussa was greasy, the soup was fatty and spicy but without any other flavor.  \n\nWe ordered the vegetarian sampler for 4.  First the presentation was lousy. The extra injera was awkwardly rolled up around the tray (by the way we were seated at a regular table, with chairs - if you care about lack of ambiance).  The Ye' Abesha Gomen tasted plain and flavorless.  My sister actually put salt on it if that gives you an idea of how bad it was.  The Kik Alitcha (yellow split peas) also had no sauce or flavor.  The WORST dish by far was the Kay Sir Dinich (the description says: potatoes and fresh beets stewed and blended with garlic, ginger and onions) It looked and tasted like canned beats chopped up into cubes!!!!  I couldn't see any potato, and certainly did not taste any other ingredients.  It was comically bad!!!!\nThe Inguday Wat was the only edible dish, and it was just spicy, again no real flavor.\n\nSave yourself the money!!! To clarify - the service was very good (fast, polite, etc) It's just the food that I don't recommend. Plus everyone had an upset stomach after dinner.  Don't come here, it's just bad food."
4,"Wow! Love this place! The sweet heat wings are my absolute favorite! While we were there they made a \""test\"" pizza with gyro meat...that was fabulous!! They make their multiple wing sauce fresh and the ones we had were great. We had buffalo, creamy garlic Parmesan, honey BBQ & sweet heat. The pizza sauce is fantastic...being from an Italian family I am very picky about my sauce and I was impressed. Will definitely be heading back there soon!!!"
0,"The reviews are true one of the worst buffets in Vegas - food was stale overcooked or greasy. It is worth what you pay - It was comp, I will pay next time."
2,"ah yes another review. Went to Cibo with a large group of 14 current and past co-workers to hear our co-worker and friend play guitar there. Everything was great at first. Nice  service, nice atmosphere, as allways, good food. There was another large party on the patio with us and it was still quiet and relaxing. My co-worker brought his dog and it was cool that they allow that. Then I looked down and realized it was 7:30, and I needed to go. Some people were going to stay and drink more, but I had to go. So I asked the server if she could put $20 of our bill on my card. Um, I guess not. Get this- they DONT SPLIT CHECKS, and only take 4 debit/credit cards per bill. So not only could I not leave until everyone paid, but we were going to have a hard time paying the bill +20% added gratuity b/c most of us ( being 40 and under) only carry credit/debit cards. The. best part was when I asked her to put $20 on my card she looked at me and said \""What do you want me to do with the card?\"" hmm, I want to pay for my food lady. GEEZ sorry. ALL of this on a Monday night. Apparently we were $2 short ( go figure with 10 different people) and she actually brought out a calculator and tossed it at us... treated us like we were bums.The servers attitude alone was rude and ruined for us.I will go back (if I'm allowed) as the food is good and the service, usually, is good too.( At another point she said she couldn't go inside and check on something b/c \""its too busy in there\"". Hm sorry your place of work is busy on a Monday night during a recession. Don't worry, I doubt it will last for long.)"
1,"Blah - that's the best I have to say about this place. I wasn't impressed with the location or the appearance, but when you've walked for hours and hunger hits, you kind of just settle for what can be found. The service was blah, the atmosphere was blah, and the food was blah. I ordered the chicken and ribs. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the mashed potatoes had a hard outer shell on them and the cole slaw was absolutely terrible. Don't get lured in by the coupons for a free drink. They say if you buy a \""yard\"" of drink, you get one free. Their \""yard\"" was more like 18 inches for $25 bucks."
2,"I came here initially for a motza ball soup which was very delicious so I decided to go back for Pizza and egg drop soup (I'm trying to cover all nationalities OK :) \n\nThe soup was a bit too salty, but the pizza was just horrible. The bottom was so soggy. Ick. \n\nIt's convenient, but careful with what you choose."
3,Good service and good food. The downfall to this restaurant is that they serve Pepsi products only.
0,"After my first review, one of the managers finally called me.  We agreed that they would send me a free night's stay because they \""Couldn't refund my card...\""  Since then, I have not received anything in the mail or any credit on my card, or even a phone call stating something has changed.  I also read other reviews about the HOTEL itself.  NONE of them were good regarding customer service when there were problems.  GVR is going to go under.  The management there is TERRIBLE.  Shame on them..."
2,"Stayed here for a business training.  It's a Hilton, so the rooms were nice.  The pool area and bar were awesome, and the cleaning staff were nice.  The only issue I had was with the front desk.  There was a mix-up with my reservation (their fault), they charged my company Am Ex twice, and I had to go through Am Ex to get the situation remedied.  They could have made a better attempt to satisfy a customer!!!"
1,"First off, I admit that I don't usually do pedicures.  I rather spend my money on something else- like food!  However, my sister was in town and wanted to take me and my 6 year old daughter to get pedicures for her birthday.  We wanted to all 3 get done at the same time with short notice and this place could accomodate us.  They have 7 massaging pedicure chairs in a row.  The wash, trim, massage and paint was just okay.  And for $25 per person, plus tip I thought that was expensive.  The service was ugh... they didn't speak English or interact with us... only with each other."
3,"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and Matt sure likes his eggs and bacon in the morning hours!  I was actually able to get into their newest location and sit a the bar.  I'm not a big lady but the stools were tiny and I kept slipping off the stool. \n\nThe staff and service was great.  She was busy however able to fill up my coffee cup without being asked.  I ordered the omelet with cheddar, mushrooms and of course bacon with hash browns and white toast.  Surprisingly the toast and jam, I really enjoyed the most! The omelet was filled with melted cheese, grilled mushrooms and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and overall the dish was tasty.   Matt's prides itself for making everything from scratch or most of it.  And it is really good, if you are into traditional bacon and egg kind of dishes for breakfast.  The coffee was actually really good and didn't leave a bitter taste.  \n\nI would recommend getting there earlier than later due to Matt's reputation in the Valley. The place does get crowded even if it's in a bigger location. \n\nNext time: Waffles!"
2,"Ok, so this place was a detour on the Coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw), it was not on my list due to its low rating, BUT it was the only coffee place open at 11pm last night when I wanted coffee SO it is added. This place was hopping last night. I guess they would have to be given the time of night... if you aren't old enough to drink, it's kind of this place or denny's. So, I went in with the BF and there were a couple of interesting guys behind the counter who helped us. I got a latte and the BF got cafe au lait. My latte was decent , it had mild coffee flavor, but it wasn't unpleasant by any means. His was fine as well. In addition, I looked in the dessert cases and all of their pastries had flies and bugs all around them.... so big turn off there, I would not be ordering that. So overall they are ok AND they are open 24 hours on fri and sat, so that gives them a bit of an edge over other places (Come on Phoenix! everything should not close at 10 pm! we need more 24 hour coffee.)"
0,"I've bought tires from Discount Tire for years at different locations and have had a good experience, but this location was different. I went in to get some new tires with my fianc\u00e9. John the sales guy pushed a certain brand, specifically because they were running a rebate special. Tires are tires, especially on a Prius, so we went with them. \n\nLater that day, when filling out the rebate form online, I noticed that the model number that we purchased was not listed on the valid model numbers for the promotion. I called back to Discount Tire, told them the dilemma, who then stated the model number was irrelevant and the rebate would go through. \n\nI'll give you 1 second to contemplate where I'm heading with this. A couple weeks later we got an email saying our entry was denied due to non-valid model number. We called back to Discount Tire, where John denied any knowledge, spoke to the manager, who told me it was his last day and his hands were tied. I then called the regional office, left a message and NEVER got a call back. \n\nNext time I need tires, I'm going to C&R or Big O, or any other of the countless places on every street corner that sells them. Just not a way to run a business."
3,"Cool Beans. \nNeato.\nFar out.\n\nWhen did speech become so convoluted with things like verbs and syntax? \n\nLucky for us, Cool Beans on the east side keeps it real... in more ways than one. First off, the seating is plentiful, and when you add a cool outside space during the warmer months, there's no shortage of real estate if your going at it solo or in a huge group. There's even a back room that looks like it can be closed off with a set of doors. Coffee and tea are what you'd expect, not the best brew I've had in town, but certainly not the worst. But it's their food options that blew me away originally. They really take the whole \""cafe\"" thing to a new level with a plentiful amount of soup, salad and sandwich options to satisfy anyone. Think Panera, but much better. Much much better. The particular day I was there I dug into some minestrone and a half of a jerk sandwich served up on a toasted pita. Both were quite tasty. \n\nAdd some free WIFI and decadent looking pastries and you have the makings for a pretty nifty spot for chit-chat, laptop'n or busting out the bridge set. People still do that, right?"
3,"These accomodations are crazy. The interior decor is so gaudy you wouldn't believe. It looks like the kind of place that your grandma would say is really nice. How about those vine work wallpaper borders all over the room? Nice touch. And oh, the wooden venetian column heads nailed into entryways, stunning. \n\nWord brah, how about the vermin that were living in my bathroom sink the whole time I was there and never cleaned out by housekeeping.\n\nWatch out for top floor rooms. That air conditioner is on the roof right over your bed.\n\nDood, if you found this place because it had a low business rate, and you're trying to be budget conscious, think for two minutes about how poorly you're going to sleep. It's also far away from every place that anyone on business would want to be at."
3,The burgers are amazing and the other food does not disappoint!  Always looking forward to the latest Chef's special!
0,"Staying at the Stratosphere was right up there with THE worst experience I have ever had at a hotel stay. I have traveled all over and stayed at many different hotels from 2 stars to 5 stars and this takes the cake on one of the worst. \n\nNot only did I find a COCKROACH on the first day on the night stand next to where we sleep at night..!!!!!! Which alone is horrible and appalling, but the tub was completely disgusting with hair left from previous hotel guests and other particles. I can't express how important cleanliness is to me when staying away from home. After I PERSONALLY cleaned the tub to relax before a night out I turned on the jets and two jets FELL right out of the tub! I tried to fix them but they were obviously broken and had been for some time. When I drained the tub after a bath, all the water came straight up into the shower drain (they are completely separate from one another) with such a putrid smell I had to leave the bathroom for a good 30 minutes before I could then WASH the shower floor so I could step in it without getting dirty water/sewage all over our feet. \n\nThe entire hotel floor stunk of vomit or some sort of stench we could never figure out. Did I mention this was the suite that we HAD to upgrade (and pay for) because the hotel room we were given previously had a view of the parking lot with the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in Vegas? The elevator from our floor to the lobby was sticky and the elevator button was broken from stickiness or some other substance blocking it from working our entire stay.\n\nAll we could hear the entire time we were in our hotel room (which we tried to stay out of as much as possible) was the shaking of the elevators going up and down and the doors opening. I will never stay or recommend anyone to ever stay at the Stratosphere. I am appalled and disgusted with the conditions and customer service of this hotel. After awhile all we could do was laugh at the situation and got the heck out of there as soon as we could! You might as well stay at the Holiday motel across the street, at least that would be cheaper."
0,"Horrible service,  they're always so rude! I won't be returning here and suggest you don't go either. Negative stars if I can give that."
0,I guess reservations don't mean anything at this location. Think I would stick with the Peoria location .
2,Decent Alternative/Rock station that has been around a while.  I like to tune in for a nice break to the other stuff played around town.
4,"Imagine if Michaels and Kirklands had a baby.. that child is Hobby Lobby. \n\nI try to stay away from this store, only because I leave with way more than I intended to buy. Everything you need craft wise is here. From puzzles to model cars, do it yourself crafts to quilting supplies, Hobby Lobby has all of your crafting needs.\n\nHome decore is another area where Hobby Lobby succeeds. Furinture, nick-nacks, area rugs, lamps and more. Theres even a special section for any guy looking to decorate his man cave. Don't be fooled guys, this place will also please you. \n\nTheres always great deals going around the store, from 50% off holiday fabric, 50% off anything metal etc. I bought a large area rug for $50 and countless home decorations and paintings for around $10 each.\n\nThis place is amazing but for all you weekend shoppers beware: closed on Sunday"
1,This hotel was once amazing but that was in the 90s and it hadn't been renovated since. :(\nThe prices are high for an upper end hotel in this area and what you get for your money may be the least impressive of anything on its level. \nI checked in and requested a room close to the main building and was given what was unquestionably one of the farthest rooms. I called and was then moved to a closer room but I was brought there via many service entrances and nasty back end corridors clearly for staff only. \nThe room was acceptable but not on par with the price point and level of this hotel. Guests I spoke with however made me think my room with dirty Starbucks cups on the balcony was one of the higher end rooms bc I was told of peeling wallpaper and insect infestation in other rooms. \nBasically this hotel earned it's reputation a few decades ago and is still thriving off it bc what it is currently is hardly what one would equate with Waldorf Astoria name.
3,"The food was excellent! The chicken was great. I wish I would have checked Yelp though as it was definitely not a kid friendly place. The service was rather slow which for a \""date\"" restaurant that was probably fine but we took two toddlers there just based on a recommendation that the food was good but we didn't talk about the atmosphere."
4,"ok been here tuns of times and now finally writing a review, i have been to many places in vegas and for me this is the best place by far. love the Pho and also all the other dishes"
1,"Let me start with a positive. The wait staff were attentive. Now let's go to the negative... the food. It was pedestrian. The pancakes were chewy, the oatmeal had a glob of berry compote rather than fresh berries, the potatoes and biscuits were cold. I was hoping this would be better than your average chain but I was wrong. I had been before during the week and it was much much better Perhaps Saturday is not a day to go."
2,"This place has a couple things going for it, location and its lunch specials.  The food is mostly typical grill fare.  It isn't exceptionally innovative but it meets expectations.  With a little time and the humility to act on recommendations from the Yelp community this place could be another Arcadia fixture."
2,Gloppy sugary sweet flavorless anglofied sauces.  Tiny bowl for your food choices.  Intrusive server. Fresh ingredients.  The perfect Mongolian BBQ for Republicans.
3,"Always love coming here. It's always packed and the outdoor patio looks out over a nice lake. Service is always decent, nothing special. It's a healthy alternative to anything else, I think."
4,"Was referred to Gianni and ended up with Jake. Awesome experience with both guys! I'm not \""into\"" tattoos and needed a little cover up so this is a little out of my comfort zone. Both guys made me feel very comfortable and what jake designed was better than my expectations. Love this place!"
3,One of my favorite spots to visit when I come to Vegas. It's extremely casual and the the concept is all open which is great. You can custom order any pizzas you want but they have some already created that are great. They even have a Nutella pizza! It's pretty well priced and the pieces are all personal to the customer. Def a must try of you find yourself in the MGM!!
4,"After trying many of the 5 star resturants on the strip, this is my top choice.  Service unlike any other, they make the Bellagio service seem like diner food.  The food, creative, delicate and sooooooooooo tasty and cooked to perfection.  I knew when we had the appetizers that we were in for a treat of a lifetime."
4,"The owner / operated is super friendly, even remembered me from almost a month ago. I happened to stop in bc I was getting my tires rotated next door...and had to go back because the chicken tacos are AMAZING.  His unique blend of spices are awesome...I think the chx tacos only have chicken and lettuce on them...seems super simple...completely incredible.  This little stand is WAY worth driving out of the way for.  And a guy this passionate and friendly and customer service-driven deserves to make it...and somehow I think he will.  He threw in a little sweet bread puff (forget the actual name) while we waited for our order.  When the sun is out, the umbrellas provide shade if you want to eat there (don't know what angerball was talking about with no shade, and I think everyone is pretty sure it's not \""Korean food.\"" It's fusion...but anyway.  Oh, and also- how many trucks/stand have misters...seriously, I don't make a habit of commenting on others' posts, but that one seems unusually unfair...)  \n\nAnyway, anyway.  Honestly one of the BEST tacos I've ever had.  Five stars for being exactly what it's suppose to be as far a taco truck goes...and for having food quality worthy of an established restaurant, which, if it existed, would be bumpin'. \n\nI'm super stoked to go back.  \n\nOH. And notice photo with the giant yellow umbrella."
0,Be careful with this place! We opened new lines here and got new phones with Bill. And he added features onto my account without asking for our consent. Thank goodness I have a friend that works at T-mobile and knows that some Tmobile associates add more features to their customer's plan to get more commission and this is a commission fraud. I will be reporting a commission fraud at this place so they will not charge poor innocent people 40 dollars more per month like they did to us. T-mobile is awesome but these money hungry associates make T-mobile look bad! Once again be careful at this place! And especially with Bill or anyone here since this is not the first time!
1,"This is one of the restaurants in the red rock resort. From outwards appearances it is your standard upscale place.Nicely decorated,white table cloths etc. Oh and a hot hostess(gotta have that :). anyways...our waitress was very nice..i asked her to pick me out a glass of cabernet 15 dollar range (wasnt crazy about the selection,but thats the chance you take when you ask someone to choose) Ceasar salad was bland and pretty flat tasting. My guest had the veal salta (something). I thought it was bland and flavorless,mushy texture to the veal. I had the chicken with artichokes...it was unimaginative and needed a binder like a rice or maybe over pasta....there were very few artichokes and it was basically chicken breast chunks..uninspiring. all this for 93.00 which i didnt have to pay for because it was comped. However,if i did need to pay I would have not been thrilled and in general i wasnt impressed. As a side note,i noticed that a lot of the staff kept congregating around the bar and were sitting there chin wagging....that is a huge no-no in a place that wants to be known as upscale. If your not doing anything go fold napkins or clean station..or even better ..check in on your customers needs. This is just another uninspiring experience at a casino resort that just doesn't get the bigger picture. If this were my place there would be a total refurbish of the menu and staff edicate."
0,"Is it possible to give something less than 1 star ?\n\nReading the reviews here, I think we went to a different show, I mean seriously, I expected a little bit of Vegas OTT, but wow, how to describe this train wreck of a show......\n\nThink high school musical, with breasts, lots and lots and lots of breasts....And feathers.\n\nBeing serious, don't waste your hard earned money on this."
1,"I have a very good feeling that a lot Stratta's business comes from the fact it is is open till the wee hours of the night and for Wynn hotel guests who return from a night debauchery, its an insanely convenient place to refuel. For convenience, I give this place 14 stars, but for the quality of the actual food, it's just nothing special. Now, I like staying at the Wynn so I can pretty much guarantee I will end up eating at Stratta many, many more times. I suppose its possible the execution of the regular dinner menu is much better, but I 'm not  sure. However, if you are looking for some late night eats, Stratta is likely to be one of your only convenient options so just stick to the basics pizza and pasta... you'll appreciate the extra carbs the next morning."
1,"I loooooove cookies. So when a friend suggested the salted caramel cookie, I was game. The price was comparable to others in town under $2  It smelled and looked good, but fell short of impressing me. Plus, I had it heated. Maybe the cookie was not fresh on Saturdays. Will say the service was friendly. Oh well, doubt I will be back..sorry."
2,"I haven't eaten here in along time and boy has mimis gone down hill! Wrong info by servers, No Kids meal menus. Long waits even though there is no one waiting at all! I guess that's why it's empty, it's a shame because I really use to like it here. Oh also the menu says fresh oj, the lady said it's actually from concentrate. Why say it on the menu if it's not. Okay at the end the manager gave me free muffins for the long wait. That just added 2 stars. That's the kind of proactive customer loyalty the engenders brand loyalty. Still good memories from childhood will keep me returning."
0,"Cold, below average bar food served by disinterested waitresses. Eight of us chose this place over everything else here in Vegas and it was the worst bet we made all weekend! \n2 of our 8 couldnt get out of bed for 36 hours because of severe cramps and diahrhea. They each had the club sandwich. \nThe rest of the meals were just ok, but on a 4 day vacation to lose a full day and night is not acceptable. \nThis was food poisoning plain and simple. \nClearly no one associated with TK ever does any knd of quality control here. This is a great example of how not to protect your brand. The TK brand will surely be a Walmart staple before long. \nThe one star is for the Jack and Coke one of us had."
2,"This hit the spot for a little hang over cure. It's a lot like 5&Diner.  The wait staff is your typical teenybopper crew. I vote for the home fries over the hashbrowns.\n\nI found this coupon after we got back, not a bad deal:\n\nhttp://www.phoenixmetro.com/cities/chandler/chasesdiner.html"
1,"Meh. Such a wonderful word and such a great description of this restaurant. French onion soup, Meh. Not sure what people were raving about. It was basically a block of cheese with onions and bread. I came away with the feeling I could have made that in the kitchen, and that isn't a good sign.\n\nThe salad with kale is definitely false advertising. Reminded me of the \""may contain peanuts\"" warnings as the salad may contain kale. Dressing was also hugely disappointing too. \n\nI forget what else I ordered as it was completely forgettable other than the taste of disappointment.\n\nThis was also the only restaurant in Vegas I was disappointed with the service. It was busy so I totally understand the wait to take our order, but when the food was delivered they basically dumped it on the table. Didn't take any stars off for that as in the end I judge based on the food, but it did stick out as something out of place."
1,"For the most part, I like Korean food.  However, I don't dine in many Korean restaurants because I always get ambushed by overbearing servers.  Seoul Oak is no exception.\n\nMy favorite Korean spot in the east bay is run by this crazy older woman, who will yell at you, laugh with you, and take your chopsticks in order to demonstrate how to mix rice with seaweed.  My friends and I dubbed our experiences at this restaurant as \""lunch and a show\"".  The server at Seoul Oak could give this woman a run for her money.\n\nAs soon as bf and I walked in, we were greeted by a very enthusiastic server.  She sat us down, gave us a menu, proceeded to explain the menu to us, aggressively suggested what to order, and basically would not leave us alone.  I went with the classic bibimbap and bf went with a mackerel stew.\n\nWhen my bibimbap came, I poked around and tasted the elements to see how much hot sauce I needed to add.  Our server was NOT OK with this.  Nope.  Not one bit.  She proceeded to take my chopsticks and mix my dish for me.  Really?  What just happened here?\n\nTheir food was standard and on par with the other Korean places that I've eaten at.  I thought their pricing was a bit high but, that could be attributed to their location on Spring Mountain.  The food is a-ok but, that server scares me.  I'm switching to take-out from now on."
4,Nice place! I love the Thai food. I can found my favorite here! The chicken wing so juice!
1,Eating out of a shoe was simply unappetizing    Portions were spotty  and nothing stood out     A disappointment
0,"Worst place to go! This was my third visit and all three times horrible and thought I would give it another try, so third strike your out!  The manager personally made sure the car was done correctly when I returned dissatisfied.  I will not be returning. I will be going to the arrowhead location if I go to Danny's at all."
1,"We waited in line for 45 minutes. the line in front if us got longer as people met up with their friends post pool session,   we started with 10 people ahead, and eventually had 30 ahead of us, who individually ordered . by the time we got to the front,  the pickings were so slim. they said it would be another 30 minutes for a SLICE of pepperoni. and we got a disgusting piece of mixed pizza toppings (some of which I couldn't identify)and split it. very disappointing.   will not be going back. better luck at a costco food court. The drinks were in Red Solo Cups, and I'm pretty sure they were $4-5 each for one fill up. We left hungry. We bought drinks at a downstairs shop, and made a note to never come back."
1,"My usual fave spot to go for a good slice of pizza. I've been coming here for 2 years since I stayed at Tropicana and accidentally found it. The pizza by the slice was good but the price was better! $4.75 was great! I was here in Feb '13 and price was still reasonable ($5) but now, July '13, it's $8 a slice?!? Not worth it!!! I guess I have to look for a new spot, unless hopefully it was raised due to the holiday. I can only hope."
2,"As a sports bar or a seafood joint, I'll admit Shucks is on the average side.\n\nThe only reason my family and I go here is for the breakfast deals (served until 1pm most days). You can truly high quality bar-food breakfasts here for $5. Pancakes, potatoes, chicken fried steak, benedicts...all really good. You will spend more on half the amount of food at any fast food chain.\n\nI have older in-laws who wouldn't otherwise step foot in a bar, but love Shucks, and at the low price, you can take a bunch of folks out without breaking the bank and enjoy the Sunday morning NFL game while you munch away your hangover."
2,"This place is different, but good. \n\nThey offer combos for their chicken fingers. You can get them baked, grilled or fried. And they have Baked Mac + Cheese, French Fries and/or Grilled Veggies to combo your chicken choice with. Plus you get a garlic bread piece. These combos come out to about $6.\n\nI got baked with Mac & Cheese. \n\nThey say you get four chicken strips with your order, but with the baked, it seemed like I got a few more...which was a good thing because they were small. \n\nSeems like a very healthy alternative, especially if you go with the baked or grilled, plus the veggies. Not very exciting, but healthy. Plus, they have a good selection of  sauces for your strips...I guess this is where you try and add some excitement to your food and give your taste buds something to celebrate."
1,"Was looking forward to celebrating a new job with dinner here.\nThe food was great but the service was awful. We waited over ten minutes just for our waiter to come to the table. He didn't introduce himself or offer anything (drink/menu specials, etc) but he did make an excuse that it was really busy (on a Tuesday with four empty tables around us). He took our orders and said he'd be back with bread. He took another ten minutes to bring bread and drinks. When we were done eating, he came by to see if we needed a box. When he brought back the check, he left it on the table and ignored us for 20 minutes. We tried flagging him, telling him we were ready  and I finally had to stand up to stop him from ignoring our table again. We watched and listened as he talked to the elderly couple behind us, offering up the specials and explaining dishes to them. He literally ignored our attempts to stop him and several times turned and walked away! \nReally disappointing."
4,"Super convenient, right off the 143 on the south side of University. Price is decent, and you get $2 off per day with a AAA card. You can reserve a spot online if you're traveling during a busy weekend and want to ensure you won't be left scrambling, though I've never had to.\n\nJust don't lose your ticket!"
1,"I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for at least 10 years from at least 30 different people and this is one of the worst places I have been. I have been a few times because I wanted to see if it was just a one time thing or was just the way the salon operated. Every time I go in, the ladies are so unorganized with their order of taking clients in. They are not professional at all and do not know how to use the thread properly. \nAfter they finish threading my eyebrows and rest of my face, I like to look it over to make sure they got all the hairs but when I ask them to go over an area again, they make it seem like it is a huge hassle. They are not interested in the client's happiness with the final product\nTheir price list is misleading because at most salons, a full face threading includes neck but it does not include it here."
0,"Terrible Service and no Coca Cola?? Cashier's treat non platinum members like dirt, dealers try to take valid bets, housekeeping well pretty close to an urban legend."
3,Great place for dinner. The steaks and seafood are first class and worth the price. Try everything on the menu.
1,"My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1."
4,"Along the lines of car mechanics, plumbing isn't something that I would know anything about, especially as a girl.  All I know was that my gas bill quadrupled when the water heater of my unit was leaking.  I wasn't too happy and I wasn't happier when my landlord didn't want to spend money on a replacement and then wanted me to somehow pay a portion of it as a renter.  The property already had home warranty and their preferred vendors, but the price of the company was pricey for my landlord.  \n\nI called Adaven plumbing to get a quote and the technician was nice enough to come  and take a look while also shopping around for better priced water heaters.  Unfortunately, the landlord decided to go with the other company even though Adaven was able to provide a cheaper one (smh...seirously?!).  Although, we didn't use Adaven, they still had GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE (which definitely is lacking here in Vegas), and was nice enough to take their time to do a FREE ESTIMATE and shop around for me.  If anything, I'll definitely consider Adaven for any of my plumbing needs."
3,"Decent Korean food... granted, there aren't many good places in Pittsburgh for Korean food compared to NY, but this will do.  I only come here to get the Bulgogi lunch box special (around $8 plus tax and tip), which is not a bad deal.  It comes with salad, ONE (!) dumpling, rice, kimchi, and a miso soup.  Sometimes, they serve you hot tea for free (if they don't, you should just ask for it and they'll give it to you).  They don't really give you that many side dishes though, which is surprising and disappointing...\n\nThe service is not bad, it's usually a cute Korean girl running around to serve everyone.  The restaurant isn't that big, but it's not that small either (like Oiishi).  Parking can be hard to find since Korea Garden is tucked away in the slums of University of Pittsburgh off campus housing, as we affectionately call it, so it'll call for street parking.  I think there is a parking lot, but I haven't seen it yet.\n\nPersonally, I think Oiishi Bento has better Korean food :p but Korea Garden is not bad, especially for Pittsburgh."
3,"Ask for the gamblers special.  7.77  dollar steak dinner.  Its as tough as a 7 dollar steak.  \n\nThe Hard Rock has the most unique clientele of all the casinos.  I enjoy just wandering around and shooting craps there.\n\nIf you're hungry and have spent all your money, get into Mr.Lucky's, sit at the bar,  choke down the steak, and get back to enjoying the ambiance of the casino!"
4,"We are always on the look out for good Chinese and something that is different or unique.  My husband had read reviews and decided we should try this place out.  I hadn't had a chance to review and didn't know what to expect, but if he was excited about the menu, then I knew it must be good.\n\nSo, as usual, he'd given the menu a once over and made our selections.  The only server was a woman, and she was very  friendly, she took our order and went off to get it turned in and obtain my \""pot of tea\"".  I got the oolong and it was wonderful. They have three choices and they all seemed inviting. \n\nIn a little she pulled up to the table with a cart loaded with a beautiful display, the big plate was set up with four steamed Chinese buns, with sliced scallions and hoisin sauce.  There were four thinly sliced crispy duck skin pieces placed with a bit of scallion onto the bun with a dab of the hoisin sauce, the smells were terrific and the crunch of the skin with the bun was even better. \n\nThey served the rest of the duck cut into small pieces with the bone served with the plum sauce.  We got several other dishes and they were all as good as the duck!  This is a very simple restaurant with great service and terrific food.  Just right for something new!"
0,Service looks like has gone way down from when first opened. Not worth the prices for how you get treated!!
4,"excellent food and drinks, happy hour is awesome"
0,"Don't call this landscaping company unless you want to waste your time.  Initially, the guy who answered the phone sounded friendly and I set a 10am appointment for them to come to my house to give me a quote. I called them at 10:10am because they had not arrived yet.  The same guy answered and said he thought it was for another day then said his crew may just be late. \n\nSo I wait and wait and no call back!  I call them back once again and they forwarded my calls to voicemail.  What pisses me off is I took off from work for this appointment and they don't even have the decency to call me back.  \n\nTHIS COMPANY WILL STAND YOU UP!!!!!"
3,"Only got take out from here. I will have to try dining in. The food was delicious and ready fast. We ordered lemon chicken, beef fried rice, and egg rolls. All of it was delicious and reasonably priced. Portions were big too so leftovers for lunch!"
0,"I have to say I am appalled at their employees behavior.  I have never been treated with so much hostility in an environment of this kind.  I was a loyal shopper until recently.  One of their employees followed me throughout the store harassing me and accused me of things without regard for my family or my children.  Peggy- the store associate bullied my kids while trying on shoes then offered help.  I immediately accepted so that she would stop harassing me. She then directed me to a mat without helping. I then told her she is not measuring as she promised then she reluctantly complied.  Shortly thereafter she yelled at me in an entirely different section for something completely unrelated.  After this Peggy, the associate, was complaining to another customer about me stating she wanted to call the police.  This was a clear case of harassment.  Peggy continued to discuss our interactions creating a hostile environment and told the other customer to go to the manager.  The other customer was then directing the manager to call the police and then stated \""go back to where u came from\"". This is definitely a society in which I was hoping that discrimination based on sex, race, status was a part of the past however clearly Peggy was stuck in a different era."
2,"Nice lounge in the casino area of Aria.  Limited menu, premium drinks, and blackjack tables with beautiful young dealers.  My friend sat down and won about $2K in an hour, obviously the exception, since the house always wins.  Overpriced but it's Vegas so expect it.  The waitress had a stick up her ass, grumpy at best, but the environment itself was nice.  Have a drink or two and leave."
3,"About 50+ of my friends and I visited this place last Monday night (yes we gave them a heads-up we'd be coming)... like a bunch of locust we stormed this place for about an hour of drinking and socializing before hitting the road. Walking in, this place isn't the biggest, but I was surprised to find a very good size patio out back with a ping-pong table. They have a pool table too and although it's really just a bar, if you need a snack while there, they have some bar food options (basically anything that'll fit in a microwave behind the bar). The owners were very friendly and the waitress working the bar did a great job handling the crowd. I give them 2-thumbs up. Great little neighborhood hang out."
4,"Yum yum yum!!!! Best buffet in vegas!!!! There is everything and anything your heart desires! Service is phenomenal too! Save room for dessert, and the best part is the big guy cutting all the smoked meats yelling out WELCOME TO BACCANO"
3,Just went here for the first time during brunch. I had a great experience; everything from our food to our service. The prices are decent and the menu is diverse. Check this place out if you're in the central Phoenix area!
3,"The Pavillion got a facelift, new name and concept.\n\nYou've probably ventured here for things like Alive After Five, the Elevate Awards, Silent Disco, etc. However, it's more than just an place for events... it's now a regular uptown bar as well.\n\nFull bar, tvs and a great view of the city. Even better: the people watching at the EpiCentre. This may be better than people watching at the airport. \n\nThings you should know: parking here is expensive. Plan to pay a minimum of $10. I recommend light rail or parking a block away at the Fitzgerald's/Wake Forest deck. East walk from there. It's usually only $5. \n\nI used this space to throw a baby shower a couple months ago. We hung paper lanterns and just did some simple decorations. It was gorgeous and the pictures turned out fabulous.\n\nIf you're out and about uptown looking for a patio to enjoy a cold drink... stop by here."
4,"Interbike is the highlight of my year, EVERY YEAR!\n\nThis is the gathering of bike nerds, and nuts from all over the world could not be any better.  Sands Expo Center has 1.2 MILLION square feet of pure pleasure while Interbike is in town.  In fact the show is going on as I type this, and will end tomorrow.  I had to come home 2 days early to go to school unfortunately.\n\nPlease please please, open a bike shop, and go to Interbike to experience the fun, and swag that it has in store."
4,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I'm from L.A. and I gotta say I've tried alot of really great burgers, but I think the farm burger from here is my favorite!!! Also, shake #4 which is an oreo shake is by far the best shake I've had! BurGR has become a necessary stop every time I go to Vegas. I was just in Vegas this past weekend and stopped at BurGR yesterday and it was even better than I remembered. The jalapeno poppers, farm burger, and oreo shake were all delicious AND the prices are extremely reasonable, especially for Vegas. Our server was awesome and very attentive. The wait was an hour and a half, but I have to say it was definitely worth it. My friends and I just played roulette in the Planet Hollywood Casino while we waited to be conveniently texted once our table was ready. THIS IS A MUST WHEN IN VEGAS!!!!!!!"
0,"I came to the restaurant for Sunday brunch. I called to make reservations and was told that they only do walk it's but the wait was 20 mins. Cool. I get to the door 15 minutes later and the wait turns into 45 minutes. At this point I was starving so I asked to sit at the bar.\n\nThe bar was pretty big and had about 3 couples sitting down. I saw a few open tables which made me question why there was a 45 minute wait. Any who, it takes about 15 minutes for the bartender to ask for my drink order. I mentioned that I was ready to order my food as well since I was more than ready to eat, and she asked if I could wait. I then noticed that she was the only bar tender in the restaurant serving not only the bar and our orders, but making all of the bottomless mimosas for the entire restaurant. Therefore it took 40 minutes for my food to come out and my order was wrong. I had to ask for a manager to rush my order because it was getting ridiculous. I ate an hour later with 1 mimosa, in which one of the managers had to run to the store to buy more champagne..... \n\nI will never dine here again. Good luck with those Groupons out there, the staffing is terrible and the food isn't ANYthing special. Our bartender was working very hard might I say. She had black hair with tattoos."
4,The White Sands Chimi is my regular favorite.  Best salsa in town but ask for the hot salsa which is my number one favorite.  Margaritas are great and HUGE.  Food is more New Mexican than Mexican.  It's spicy but excellent.  Ask for Raul.  He made us laugh and gave us great service.  Our favorite Mexican in Scottsdale.
2,"Little Dumpling changed a little bit since my last visit. They still offer fresh, quick, hot very low priced entrees that include a cup of soup mostly priced at $5.50. They dropped the side salad and the short menu and the scoop of rice is no longer heart shaped.\n\nI enjoyed the ginger chicken last time so I decided to try it again. The white meat chicken was still very moist and nicely prepared but they weren't spot on with the sauce this time as most of it lacked the ginger and was too heavy with soy sauce.\n\nI tried a bite of the basil chicken. It was very tasty and good but not what I know as basil chicken. It was a different formula that wasn't as balanced as I like it with the garlic  chilies and fresh basil. It seemed heavy with shrimp paste instead of fish sauce but it still tasted good.\n\nI would still keep them on my rotation. Not the best but much better than a lot of places."
0,Do NOT recommend.  Horrible Customer Service.  Owner (Kenny) swears at customers.  Plenty of other mechanics in town that treat customers with respect.
0,"I dunno what bean-counter took over this place, but seriously, dude, stop counting the beans.  And steak.  And pork.  The last three times I've been, I've had to remind the preparer that a quarter ounce of meat does not a taco make.  You know who is down the block?  Salsaritas.  At the moment they own your ass.   And my dollar"
1,Please update this place.
4,Had a burrito with carne asada it was good. But when I put the salsa on it it was superb! Had just the right portion to fill me up! Great
4,"I've gotten haircuts now from all three barbers, and they're all exceptional.  This is an awesome haircut by master barbers at the same price as those \""discount\"" hack-joints.  Though I don't partake, they give you beer while  you wait.  There is no other place to go... seriously.  And try their pomade."
0,"When walking in,  there was no wait.  The girl looks at my boyfriend and asks if we were the party of 5. I said no,  just 2. She continued to look over us and continued on with other business. We sat down  figuring we had to be next. 3 other groups  walked in and we're immediately  seated. I figured they had to be reservations. So I asked if they were aware we had been waiting. We received  minimal  apology then they seated us with someone's walker crammed  behind the table (in between  tables). The service was terrible and we will not be returning to this location ."
4,Been coming here for 15 years.\n\nPro's\n- rolls and sweet breads (have to ask) are fantastic \n- meals all good portion size and high quality!\n- atmosphere good on bar side (tv's for games)\n- atmosphere on other side quiet but very nice\n- has a couple large rooms for bigger groups\n\nCon's\n- bar side service tends to be slower than expectation; only one server covers that area.\n\n\nSo happy this restaurant remains given the market space for dining is so competitive.\n-
3,"Whether you're a practical prepper, a military enthusiast, or have a lifelong love of camping, you'll find virtually anything you'll need at Hahn's for the survivalist in all. They have clothing, utensils, cooking supplies, dehydrated food, water purifiers, and various bags, just to name a few! They even have radiation prevention kits (Think Rad-X from Fallout). There's even a few glass cases filled with various military memorabilia from the various military branches, and from various wars.\n\nThe only real negative for me at least is that the cooling system isn't the best in this store, so on a sweltering hot day it gets quite warm in there! I'm a weather wuss, but for others this shouldn't deter those that are devoted to surviving outdoors though, since that's just part of dealing with and adjusting to your environment."
