    "In the simplest approach to empirical risk minimization, we began with a matrix of features $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$ and a vector of targets $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We defined a linear score  $s =  \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}\\rangle$ which we interpreted as producing predictions of the value of $y$. We then defined a loss function $\\ell: \\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that told us the quality of the prediction $s$ by comparing it to a true target $y$. Our learning problem was to find $\\mathbf{w}$ by minimizing the *empirical risk*: the mean (or sum) of the risk across all data points:  \n",

More importantly, we would have to redo the calculation every time we wanted to add more layers to our model. We'd then need to program them in, check for bugs, etc. Not good! \n",

    "Second, **we need to deal with very large data**. Note that computing the empirical risk in @eq-single-layer requires us to sum over all $n$ data points.
