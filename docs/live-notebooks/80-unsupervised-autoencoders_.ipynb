    "# Unsupervised Learning and Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in these notes, we have focused almost exclusively on *supervised* learning. In this setting, we had a predictor matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and a target vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Our general goal was to learn patterns that would allow us to make predictions: given a new set of predictors $\\mathbf{x}$, we could compute a prediction $\\hat{y}$ that is hopefully \"close\" in some sense to the true label $y$. As we saw, this supervised framework encompasses both classification and regression problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens when there are no targets $\\mathbf{y}$? Is it still possible to learn some interesting patterns in our data? Yes! *Unsupervised learning* is the name for the broad class of machine learning problems that ask us to \"find some patterns in the data\" without necessarily using a target variable to evaluate whether these patterns are \"right\" or \"accurate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "There are *many* kinds of unsupervised learning, and there is no single unifying framework that can capture all of them. For the purposes of these notes, we are going to focus on a particular paradigm for unsupervised learning that captures several important and useful examples. This is the framework of *encoders* and *decoders*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$ be our matrix of data. An *encoder* is a function $\\phi_e: \\mathbf{x} \\mapsto c_\\mathbf{x}$, which associates to each data point $\\mathbf{x}$ a *code* $c_{\\mathbf{x}}$. This code is intended to contain some compressed information that could, in principle, be used to approximately reconstruct the data point. A *decoder* is a function which does the reconstruction: the decoder function $\\psi_d c_\\mathbf{x} \\mapsto \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ sends the code $c_\\mathbf{x}$ to a \"reconstructed\" vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. [I have added a subscript $e$ to the encoder $\\phi_e$ just to remind us that it is the encoder, and similarly a subscript $d$ to $\\psi_d$. These subscripts are mnemonic devices that don't have any further mathematical significance.]{.aside} We aim for an encoder-decoder pair that \"successfully\" approximates the original data points, where \"successful\" depends on the purpose of our unsupervised learning application as well as various modeling choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define the idea of the reconstructed data point $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ being close to the *true* data point $\\mathbf{x}$, we need to again define a *loss function* to measure closeness. Following our notation from supervised learning, we'll denote the per-observation loss $\\ell: \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Note that, unlike in the supervized learning case, $\\ell$ is a function of pairs of vectors rather than pairs of scalars representing elements of the target vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, given a data set, an encoder, a decoder, and a loss function, we can define the *reconstruction loss* of the encoder-decoder pair as \n",

    "Our goal in the encoder-decoder framework is to find good choices of the encoder $\\phi_e$ and the decoder $\\psi_d$. \n",

Many very fast implementations of k-means exist, which means that running it multiple times is usually fairly practical. \n",
