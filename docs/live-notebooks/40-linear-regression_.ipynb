    "So far in these notes, we have almost exclusively considered the *classification problem*: given some data with categorical labels, we aim to learn patterns in the data that will allow us to predict new labels for new unseen data. In the *regression  problem*, we instead aim to learn patterns in the data that will allow us to predict a *quantitative* variable. If you want to predict the future price of a stock, the GPA of a Middlebury College student, or the number of wildfires in Vermont per year, you need to solve a regression problem. \n",

    "In these lecture notes we'll focus on the *linear* regression problem and some of its extensions. Linear regression is an easy object of focus for us because it can be formulated in the framework of empirical risk minimization that we have recently been developing. In its most fundamental form, linear regression is the task of fitting a line to a cloud of points that display some kind of trend. Here's the simple picture: "
