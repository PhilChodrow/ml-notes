    "## Representational Harm and Representational Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this course, we discussed *allocative bias*. Allocative bias occurs when different groups have inequitable opportunities to access important resources or opportunities on the basis of their identity. We discussed examples that raised questions about equitable access to personal liberty, employment, and insurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Representational bias* refers to the systematic cultural representation of marginalized groups in harmful ways, or of denying them cultural representation at all. The perpetuation of *harmful stereotypes* is perhaps the most well-known form of representational harm. *Erasure* is another form of representational harm in which representations or topics of interest to marginalized groups are suppressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a very recent example (from Margaret Mitchell) illustrating how representational gender bias shows up in ChatGPT: \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I replicated this (my screenshot below).<br>Really great example of gender bias, for those of you who need a canonical example to make the point. <a href=\"https://t.co/O1A8Tk7oI1\">https://t.co/O1A8Tk7oI1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hKt4HSBzh3\">pic.twitter.com/hKt4HSBzh3</a></p>&mdash; MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1650110045781393410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of representational harm in ML systems is the famous historical tendency of Google Search to surface demeaning and offensive search results related to people of color. This tendency was studied by Dr. Safiya Noble in her book *Algorithms of Oppression*. In one of Dr. Nobel's most famous examples, top results for the phrase \"black girls\" in 2011 consisted of links to porn sites, which did not hold true of searches for \"white girls\" or \"black men.\" As late as 2016, an image search for \"gorillas\" would surface pictures of Black individuals. You can find a brief synopsis of some of Dr. Noble's findings [here](https://time.com/5209144/google-search-engine-algorithm-bias-racism/) (content warning: highly sexually explicit language).  Google has since taken steps to improve these specific examples. \n",

    "### Bias in Google Translate \n",
    "\n",
    "It is well-documented that machine learning algorithms trained on natural text can inherit biases present in those texts. One of the most direct ways in which we can observe such bias is in Google Translate. Some languages, such as Hungarian, do not possess gendered pronouns. When Google Translate attempts to render these pronouns into a gendered language like English, assumptions are made, as pointed out in [this Tweet by Dora Vargha](https://twitter.com/DoraVargha/status/1373211762108076034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373211762108076034%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-7356743851859968838.ampproject.net%2F2103240330002%2Fframe.html).  Let's demonstrate with the following English sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **he** cooks.\n",
    "> **she** is a political leader.\n",
    "> **she** is an engineer.\n",
    "> **he** is a cleaner.\n",
    "> **he** is beautiful. \n",
    "> **she** is strong. \n",
    "\n",
    "Translate these into Hungarian and back via Google Translate, and here's what you'll get: \n",
    "\n",
    "> **she** cooks.\n",
    "> **he** is a political leader.\n",
    "> **he** is an engineer.\n",
    "> **she** is cleaning.\n",
    "> **she** is beautiful.\n",
    "> **he** is strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that English *has* a gender neutral pronoun (*they*), this would be an easy item to fix, which Google has thus far declined to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intersections of Representational and Allocative Harms \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, representational and allocative harms can intersect and reinforce each other. For example, modern translation systems perform impressively in certain languages but much less well in others. Some of these languages, such as Pashto and Dari, are spoken by many refugees and asylum-seekers to the US. The use of automated translation software when processing these asylum cases has drawn considerable scrutiny and [appears to have resulted in the denial of at least one case](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-translation-errors-afghan-refugees-asylum/) due to a machine translation error.  \n",

    "For more on the topic of bias in language models, you may wish to read the now-infamous paper by Emily Bender, Angelina McMillan-Major, Timnit Gebru, and \"Shmargret Shmitchell\" (Margaret Mitchell), \"[On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots](https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/Stochastic_Parrots.pdf).\" This is the paper that ultimately led to the firing of the final two authors by Google in late 2020 and early 2021.
