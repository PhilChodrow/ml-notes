    "In this lecture, we'll study one of the oldest machine learning algorithms: the perceptron. Invented in 1943 but not actually implemented in hardware until 1958, the perceptron is still relevant today as a fundamental building-block of modern deep neural networks. Indeed, one of the implementations of neural networks in `scikit-learn` is still called the \"[multilayer perceptron](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html).\" \n",
    "\n",
    "When first announced, the perceptron algorithm also displayed one of the first examples of [AI HypeÂ®](https://criticalai.org/the-ai-hype-wall-of-shame/). The *New York Times* uncritically repeated claims by a Navy rep that the perceptron algorithm would be the \"embryo\" of a computer that would \"walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself, and be conscious of its existence.\" As we study and implement the perceptron, you may wish to reflect on what you are doing and decide for yourself whether you believe that you are building the \"embryo\" of any such capabilities yourself.\n",
