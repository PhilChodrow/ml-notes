    "As we've seen from the last several lectures, deep learning models involve a **lot** of linear algebra in order to compute predictions and gradients. This means that deep models, even more than many other machine learning models, strongly benefit from hardware that is good at doing linear algebra *fast*. As it happens, graphics processing units (GPUs) are very, very good at fast linear algebra. [The reason that GPUs are so good at this is that they were originally optimized for rendering complex graphics in e.g. animation and video games, and this involves lots of linear algebra.]{.aside} So, it's very helpful when running our models to have access to GPUs; using a GPU can often result in up to 10x speedups. While some folks can use GPUs on their personal laptops, another common option for learning purposes is to use a cloud-hosted GPU. My personal recommendation is Google Colab, and I'll supply links that allow you to open lecture notes in Colab and use their GPU runtimes. \n",

    "As mentioned above, it can be very helpful to use data loaders to manage the process of reading in data and passing it to your model. This is especially helpful in the case that your data set is too large to fit in RAM; the data loader can read the data from disk and pass it to the model, without ever needing to fit the entirety of data in RAM. You can learn much more about how Torch manages data sets and data loaders in [the docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#loading-batched-and-non-batched-data)."
