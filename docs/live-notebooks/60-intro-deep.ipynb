    "# The Problem of Features and Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by recalling and slightly expanding the empirical risk minimization framework that we've developed throughout this course. In the simplest approach to empirical risk minimization, we began with a matrix of features $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$ and a vector of targets $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We defined a linear score  $s =  \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}\\rangle$ which we interpreted as producing predictions of the value of $y$. We then defined a loss function $\\ell: \\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that told us the quality of the prediction $s$ by comparing it to a true target $y$. Our learning problem was to find $\\mathbf{w}$ by minimizing the *empirical risk*: the mean (or sum) of the risk across all data points:  \n",

    "\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "                 &= \\argmin_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\ell(\\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle, y_i)\\;. \n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, we solved this problem using gradient descent. However, we soon ran into an issue -- the linear score $s = \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}\\rangle$ is only capable of describing linear structures in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've addressed nonlinearity in two ways. First, we tried *manual feature engineering*. In manual feature engineering, we apply a feature map $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^q$ to the rows of the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ to produce a new matrix $\\Phi(\\mathbf{X})$:  \n",

    "where $\\mathbf{w}$ had as many entries as the number of features which we generated using $\\phi$. Later on, we saw that we could actually solve this problem in some cases using *kernel methods*, which allowed us to use complex feature maps without ever explicitly calculating them. A limitation of both manual feature engineering and kernel methods is that the practitioner needs to make a choice about what features to engineer or what kernels to use. For some data sets it might be relatively easy to make this choice, while for others it might be much harder. For extremely large data sets with very complex patterns, it may be very difficult to figure out what features will facilitate the learning task. \n",

    "## The Computational Graph \n",
    "\n",
    "It will soon be very useful for us to start thinking about the operations underlying the computation of the loss in terms of a *computational graph*. In the computational graph, we break down each operation as an edge in the graph, storing the result of that operation in the nodes. \n",

    "## Optimizing the Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a superficially simple question about @eq-ERM and its associated computational graph: what if we could learn both the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ *and* the feature map $\\phi$ simultaneously? That is, what if we could solve a problem like \n",

    "\n",
    "In particular, let's choose a *nonlinear* function $\\alpha: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and a matrix $\\mathbf{U} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}$. We'll define our feature map $\\phi$ by the formula $\\phi(\\mathbf{X}) = \\alpha(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{U})$, where $\\alpha$ is applied to each element of the matrix $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{U}$.

If we were only looking at the inputs and final computational operations of the model, we wouldn't see $\\mathbf{U}$ at all. We only see it when we look at the complete sequence of network operations. \n",

    "A so-called *neural network* is a machine learning model that involves one or more arrays of hidden parameters. These models are also often called *deep learning* models -- their \"depth\" is in the unseen layers. \n",

    "## Implementation via Torch\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and implement some of these models in Torch. For our first implementation, we are going to focus on the simplest linear model without feature maps. The implementation of this model using Torch's standard neural network model is relatively similar to how we've implemented linear models in the past. The main difference is that instead of manually managing a weight vector `self.w`, instead we manage a `nn.Sequential` object that contains one or more layers of computation. Here, the `Linear` layer implements matrix multiplication and holds the analog of our vector `self.w`. Another difference is that we do not usually implement the loss in the model itself. Instead, we usually call a pre-implemented loss function during the training loop. "
