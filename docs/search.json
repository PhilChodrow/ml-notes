    "text": "Supervised Learning\nOur focus in these notes is almost exclusively on supervised learning. In supervised learning, we are able to view some attributes or features of a data point, which we call predictors. Traditionally, we collect these attributes into a vector called \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Each data point then has a target, which could be either a scalar number or a categorical label. Traditionally, the target is named \\(y\\). We aim to predict the target based on the predictors using a model, which is a function \\(f\\). The result of applying the model \\(f\\) to the predictors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is our prediction or predicted target \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\), to which we often give the name \\(\\hat{y}\\). Our goal is to choose \\(f\\) such that the predicted target \\(\\hat{y}\\) is equal to, or at least close to, the true target \\(y\\). We could summarize this with the heuristic statement:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{``}f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\hat{y} \\approx y\\;.\\text{''}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHow we interpret this heuristic statement depends on context. In regression problems, this statement typically means “\\(\\hat{y}\\) is usually close to \\(y\\)”, while in classification problems this statement usually means that “\\(\\hat{y} = y\\) exactly most or all of the time.”\nIn our regression example from above, we can think of a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) that maps the predictor \\(x\\) to the prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\). In the case of classification, things are a little more complicated. Although the function \\(g(x_1) = 1 - x_1\\) is visually very relevant, that function is not itself the model we use for prediction. Instead, our prediction function should return one classification label for points on one side of the line defined by that function, and a different label for points on the other side. If we say that blue points are labeled \\(0\\) and brown points are labeled \\(1\\), then our predictor function can be written \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\), and it could be written heuristically like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    f(\\mathbf{x}) &= \\mathbb{1}[\\mathbf{x} \\text{ is above the line}] \\\\\n                  &= \\mathbb{1}[x_1 + x_2 \\geq 1] \\\\\n                  &= \\mathbb{1}[x_1 + x_2 - 1\\geq 0]\\;.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis last expression looks a little clunky, but we will soon find out that it is the easiest one to generalize to an advanced setting.\n\n\n\n\nHere, \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) is the indicator function which is equal to 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise. Formally,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathbb{1}[P] = \\begin{cases}\n        1 &\\quad P \\text{ is true} \\\\\n        0 &\\quad P \\text{ is false.}\n        \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"

    "text": "Data Preparation\nWe can select our desired columns from the data frame, operate on them, and make assignments to them using the data-frame-as-dictionary paradigm explored in Vanderplas (2016).\nIn applied data science, at least 80% of the work is typically spent acquiring and preparing data. Here, we’re going to do some simple data preparation directed by our question. It’s going to be convenient to shorten the Species column for each penguin. Furthermore, for visualization purposes today we are going to focus on the Culmen Length (mm) and Culmen Depth (mm) columns.\n\n# use only these three columns\ndf = df[[\"Culmen Length (mm)\", \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", \"Species\"]] \n\n# remove any rows that have missing data in any of the selected columns. \ndf = df.dropna()\n\n# slightly advanced syntax: \n# replace the column with the first word in each entry\ndf[\"Species\"] = df[\"Species\"].str.split().str.get(0)\n\nAs another preprocessing step, we are going to add transformed labels represented as integers.\n\n# for later: assign an integer to each species\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\nle = LabelEncoder()\ndf[\"species_label\"] = le.fit_transform(df[\"Species\"])\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(le.classes_):\n    print(f\"Class number {i} represents {c} penguins.\")\n\nClass number 0 represents Adelie penguins.\nClass number 1 represents Chinstrap penguins.\nClass number 2 represents Gentoo penguins.\n\n\n\nTrain-Test Split\nWhen designing predictive models, it’s important to evaluate them in a context that simulates the prediction application as accurately as possible. One important way we do this is by performing a train-test split. We keep most of the data as training data which we’ll use to design the model. We’ll hold out a bit of the data as testing data, which we’ll treat as unseen and only use once we are ready to evaluate our final design. The testing data simulates the idea of “new, unseen data” – exactly the kind of data on which it would be useful for us to make predictions!\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndf_train, df_test = train_test_split(df, test_size = 0.2)\n\nNow we’re going to forget that df_test exists for a while.

    "text": "Data Analysis and Visualization\nAs a first step, it’s useful to understand how many of each species there are:\nThis is an example of a “split-apply-combine” operation (Wickham 2011). We split the dataframe into three groups depending on the species label, apply an operation (in this case, computing the number of rows), and then combine the results into a single object. Pandas implements split-apply-combine primarily through the groupby method and several associated functions. There are some nice examples of split-apply-combine in Pandas in Vanderplas (2016).\n\ndf_train.groupby(\"Species\").size()\n\nSpecies\nAdelie       123\nChinstrap     53\nGentoo        97\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThere are more Adelie penguins than Chintraps or Gentoos in this data set. Here are the proportions:\n\ndf_train.groupby(\"Species\").size() / df_train.shape[0] # divide by total rows\n\nSpecies\nAdelie       0.450549\nChinstrap    0.194139\nGentoo       0.355311\ndtype: float64\n\n\nSo, over 40% of the penguins in the data are Adelie penguins. One important consequence of this proportion is the base rate of the classification problem. The base rate refers to how well we could perform at prediction if we did not use any kind of predictive modeling, but instead simply predicted the most common class for every penguin. Here, if we always predicted “Adelie” for the species, we’d expect to be right about 45% of the time. So, a minimal expectation of anything fancier we do is that it should be correct much more than 45% of the time.\nNow Let’s take a look at our (training) data and see whether our chosen columns look like they have a chance of predicting the penguin species. We’ll show the plot both without and with the species labels.\nVanderplas (2016)\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (8, 3.5))\n\np1 = sns.scatterplot(df_train, x = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", y = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", ax = ax[0], color = \"darkgrey\")\np2 = sns.scatterplot(df_train, x = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", y = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", hue = \"Species\", ax = ax[1])\n\n\n\n\nThese plots are generated using the Seaborn library for Python. Seaborn is a high-level wrapper around the classical matplotlib library for data visualization. Although Matplotlib is very flexible, Seaborn is optimized for visualizing data contained in Pandas data frames. You can find many examples of creating Seaborn plots in the official gallery, and many tips and examples for matplotlib in Vanderplas (2016).\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the lefthand side as “what the model will see:” just physiological measurements with no labels. On the right we can see the data with its species labels included. We can see that the species are divided into clusters: Adelie penguins have measurements which tend to be similar to other Adelies; Chinstraps are similar to other Chinstraps, etc.\nThis pattern is promising! The approximate separation of the species suggests that a machine learning model which predicts the species label from these measurements is likely to be able to beat the base rate."

    "text": "Modeling and Model Selection\nLet’s go ahead and fit some models! We’re going to fit two models that are pre-implemented in the package scikit-learn. For now, you can think of these models as black-box algorithms that accept predictor variables as inputs and return a predicted target as an output. In our case, the predictor variables are the culmen length and culmen depth columns, while the target we are attempting to predict is the species. Later on, we’ll learn more about how some of these models actually work.\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC # support vector classifier\nfrom mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions # for visualization later\n\nIt’s convenient to split our data into predictors \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and targets \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). We need to do this once for each of the training and test sets.\n\npredictor_cols = [\"Culmen Length (mm)\", \"Culmen Depth (mm)\"]\ntarget_col = \"species_label\"\n\nX_train = df_train[predictor_cols]\ny_train = df_train[target_col]\n\nX_test = df_test[predictor_cols]\ny_test = df_test[target_col]\n\nWe’ll go in-depth on logistic regression later in this course.\nNow we’re ready to fit our first machine learning model. Let’s try logistic regression! In the Scikit-learn API, we first need to instantiate the LogisticRegression() class, and then call the fit() method of this class on the training predictors and targets.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nm = LR.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nSo, uh, did it work? The LogisticRegression() class includes a handy method to compute the accuracy of the classifier:\n\nLR.score(X_train, y_train)\n\n0.9633699633699634\n\n\nWow! Much better than the base rate. Note that this is the accuracy on the training data. In theory, accuracy on the test data could look very different.\nA useful way to visualize models with two numerical predictors is via decision regions. Each region describes the set of possible measurements that would result in a given classification.\nYou can unfold this code to see a simple implementation of a function for plotting decision regions which wraps the plot_decision_regions function of the mlxtend package.\n\n\nCode\ndef decision_regions(X, y, model, title):\n\n    with warnings.catch_warnings():\n        warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n        ax = plot_decision_regions(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy(), clf = model, legend = 2)\n\n        handles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\n        ax.legend(handles, \n                le.classes_, \n                framealpha=0.3, scatterpoints=1)\n\n        ax.set(xlabel = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", ylabel = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", title = f\"{title}: Accuracy = {model.score(X, y):.3f}\")\n\ndecision_regions(X_train, y_train, LR, \"Decision Regions for Logistic Regression\")\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about how support vector machines work in Vanderplas (2016). We’ll also study these models later in the course.\nWhile we’re at it, let’s try fitting a different classifier, also supplied by Scikit-learn. This classifier is called support vector machine (SVM).\n\nSVM = SVC(gamma = 5)\nSVM.fit(X_train, y_train)\ndecision_regions(X_train, y_train, SVM, \"Decision Regions for Support Vector Machine\")\n\n\n\n\nWow! The support vector machine classifier achieved even higher accuracy on the training data. This is enabled by the greater flexibility of the SVM. Flexibility comes from a lot of places in machine learning, and generally refers to the ability of models to learn complicated decision boundaries like the ones shown here.\nBut is this increased flexibility a good thing? You might look at this predictor and think that something funny is going on. For example, shouldn’t a point on the bottom right be more likely to be a Gentoo penguin than an Adelie?…\n\nSimulating Evaluation: Cross-Validation\nNow we have two competing classification models: logistic regression and support vector machine. Which one is going to do the best job of prediction on totally new, unseen data? We could go ahead and evaluate on our test set, but for statistical reasons we need to avoid doing this until we’ve made a final choice of classifier.\nVanderplas (2016) has more on cross-validation and overfitting. We’ll confront overfitting agian many times in this course.\nIn order to make an assessment, we can simulate the process of fitting the model and evaluating on “test” data by witholding parts of our training data to use as testing. We split the data into chunks and withold each chunk, using the other chunks to train the data. This is called cross-validation, and it is illustrated in this figure:\n\n\n\nImage source: scikit-learn\n\n\nWe could do this with a janky for-loop, but the nice scikit-learn developers have implemented this for us. Here’s an example of cross-validation with 5 folds. This can take a little while, as there are actually 5 calls to model.fit() happening under the hood each time.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\nFirst let’s compute the cross-validation accuracies for logistic regression:\n\ncv_scores_LR = cross_val_score(LR, X_train, y_train, cv=5)\ncv_scores_LR\n\narray([0.964, 0.964, 1.   , 0.944, 0.907])\n\n\nA convenient way to summarize these results is by computing the average:\n\ncv_scores_LR.mean()\n\n0.9558249158249158\n\n\nLet’s compare to SVM:\n\ncv_scores_SVM = cross_val_score(SVM, X_train, y_train, cv=5)\ncv_scores_SVM.mean()\n\n0.8679461279461279\n\n\nAh! It looks like our SVM classifier was indeed too flexible to do well in predicting data that it hasn’t seen before. Although the SVM had better training accuracy than the logistic regression model, it failed to generalize to the task of unseen prediction. This phenomenon is called overfitting. Dealing with overfitting is one of the fundamental modeling challenges in applied machine learning."

    "text": "Recap\nIn these notes, we took a very quick tour of the core data science workflow. We considered a simple classification problem in which we acquired some data, cleaned it up a bit, visualized several of its features, used those features to make a predictive classification model, visualized that model, and evaluated its accuracy. Along the way, we encountered the phenomenon of overfitting: models that are too flexible will achieve remarkable accuracy on the training set but will generalize poorly to unseen data. The problem of designing models that are “flexible enough” and “in the right way” is a fundamental driving force in modern machine learning, and the deep learning revolution can be viewed as the latest paradigm for seeking appropriately flexible models.\nSo far, we haven’t attempted to understand how any of these predictive models actually work."

    "section": "What About Nonlinear Scores?",
    "text": "What About Nonlinear Scores?\nYou’ll notice in Figure 3.1 that the decision boundary is a straight line. This is due to the way that we chose to compute scores. Recall that the score function we used is \\(s_i = \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle\\). Since we imposed a threshold \\(t\\), the decision boundary is defined by the equation \\(t = s_i = \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle\\). Generically, this is the equation of a hyperplane (technically, an affine subspace). The dimension of this space is \\(p-1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of features. Here we have two features, so the decision boundary is a \\(2-1=1\\)-dimensional subspace–i.e. a line.\nWhat if we think a curved decision boundary would be more appropriate? In that case, we need to define a score function that factors in the features in a nonlinear way.\nWe started by representing each point as a 2-vector of predictors \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\left(\\text{loan interest rate}, \\text{loan percent income}\\right)\\). Let’s now add a feature map \\(\\phi\\) that accepts this vector and adds three nonlinear functions of the predictors:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\phi(\\mathbf{x}) =\n        \\left(\\begin{matrix}\n            \\text{loan interest rate} \\\\\n            \\text{loan percent income} \\\\\n            \\left(\\text{loan interest rate}\\right)^2 \\\\  \n            \\left(\\text{loan percent income}\\right)^2 \\\\\n            \\text{loan interest rate} \\times \\text{loan percent income}\n        \\end{matrix}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBecause the new features are order-2 polynomials in the predictors, this feature map is often called the quadratic feature map.\nWe’ll still use an inner product to compute our score but now the formula will be  \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    s_i = \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\rangle\\;.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]In order for this formula to make sense, we now need \\(\\mathbf{w}\\in \\mathbb{R}^5\\).\nHere’s an implementation of a score function with quadratic features:\n\ndef quadratic_score(w, X0, X1):\n    return w[0]*X0 + w[1]*X1 + w[2]*X0**2 + w[3]*X1**2 + w[4]*X0*X1\n\nNow we can set a new vector of weights \\(\\mathbf{w}\\in \\mathbb{R}^5\\) and a threshold \\(t\\).\n\nw = np.array([0.01, 1, 0.0005, 0.6, 0.001])\nthreshold = 0.5\n\nOur classification now looks like this:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\nplot_score(ax, quadratic_score, w, df)\nscatter_data(ax, df)\nplot_threshold(ax, quadratic_score, w,  df, threshold)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: quadratic score-based classification.\n\n\n\n\nHow accurate were we?\n\ndf[\"decision\"] = predict(quadratic_score, w, threshold, df)\n(df[\"decision\"] == df[\"loan_status\"]).mean()\n\n0.777\n\n\nOur nonlinear score function was very slightly more accurate than our linear score function on training data. A few things to keep in mind:\n\nPerformance on training data is not always a reliable indicator of performance on unseen data.\nAdding nonlinear features is one way of adding flexibility to a model, allowing that model to learn complicated, “wiggly” decision patterns. As we saw with the Palmer penguins case study, too much model flexibility can lead to worse predictive performance. We’ll regularly revisit the problem of balancing flexibility/features against predictive generalization throughout these notes.\n\n\nRecap\nSo, we looked at a simplified data set in which we were able to observe some features of each prospective borrower \\(i\\) in the form of a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\). We then computed a score for each borrower \\(s_i = \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle\\) and used a threshold to decide whether or not to make a loan: the loan is approved if \\(s_i \\leq t\\) for a chosen threshold \\(t\\). We can think of this as a decision-making model for the loan approval problem.\nIs that the end of the story? Of course not! There are many questions remaining.\n\nModel Evaluation: How do we actually measure whether our decision-making model is good or not? Is accuracy the right measure? Is computing accuracy on the training data reliable? How would the model perform on unseen data that wasn’t used to decide \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) or \\(t\\)? What other ways could we measure the performance of models?\nLegitimacy: Is it morally and politically appropriate to use algorithmic decision-making in the context of loan applications? What is the potential for disparate harm? What is the potential for contributing to the reinforcement of historically disparity? In what cases could algorithmic loan-making be appropriate in a democratic society? In what cases could it constitute a violation of personal political or moral rights?\nTask Choice: How was the data collected? Is it complete? Why did I choose a certain set of predictors and targets? Are my predictors and targets reliable measurements of what they claim to represent? Whose interests are served by the existence of a machine learning model that completes this task?\nAlgorithm Design: What algorithm was used to find the model (i.e. the separating line)? Is that algorithm guaranteed to converge? Will it converge quickly? Would a different algorithm find a better model? Or would it find a model that is equally good more quickly?\nVectorization: Instead of classifying points in a measurement space, how could I instead classify images, videos, or bodies of text?\n\nWe’ll discuss all of these questions – in approximately this order – later in these notes."

    "title": "4  Decision Theory in Classification",
    "section": "Types of Error",
    "text": "Types of Error\nNow that we have the scores, we can easily simulate decision-making with a given threshold. For example, the proportion predicted to default on their loan with a given threshold \\(t\\) can be computed like this:\n\nt = 0.4\npreds = s &gt;= t\npreds.mean()\n\n0.15005090785677924\n\n\nSo, how should we choose the threshold \\(t\\)? One possibility would be to try to choose the threshold in a way that maximizes the training accuracy, the number of times that the prediction agrees with the actual outcome (repaid or default) on the training data. Here’s an example of a quick grid search:\n\nfor t in np.linspace(0, 1, 11):\n    y_pred = s &gt;= t \n    acc = (y_pred == y_train).mean()\n    print(f\"A threshold of {t:.1f} gives an accuracy of {acc:.2f}.\")\n\nA threshold of 0.0 gives an accuracy of 0.22.\nA threshold of 0.1 gives an accuracy of 0.23.\nA threshold of 0.2 gives an accuracy of 0.46.\nA threshold of 0.3 gives an accuracy of 0.71.\nA threshold of 0.4 gives an accuracy of 0.82.\nA threshold of 0.5 gives an accuracy of 0.81.\nA threshold of 0.6 gives an accuracy of 0.79.\nA threshold of 0.7 gives an accuracy of 0.78.\nA threshold of 0.8 gives an accuracy of 0.78.\nA threshold of 0.9 gives an accuracy of 0.78.\nA threshold of 1.0 gives an accuracy of 0.78.\n\n\nHowever, accuracy is not always the most relevant measure. For example, Field and Stream estimates that there are, globally, approximately 70 unprovoked shark attacks each year. Since the population of the world is currently around \\(8.1\\times 10^9\\) people, the average probability that a specific individual will suffer an unprovoked shark attack in a year is approximately \\(70 / (8.1 \\times 10^9) \\approx 8.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\). So, if we created a shark attack predictor which always predicted “no shark attack,” our model would be correct approximately 99.999999% of the time. However, this model wouldn’t be very useful, and wouldn’t have anything to tell us about the activities that increase or reduce the risk of experience an attack.\nA second reason we may wish to measure something other than accuracy has to do with asymmetrical costs of error. If we incorrectly predict that an individual will suffer a shark attack but no attack occurs, this is not that big a problem. Yes, we were wrong, but no one got hurt. In contrast, if we incorrectly predict that an individual will not suffer a shark attach, then this is a big problem which potentially involves grievous bodily injury, death, trauma, legal liability, etc. So, in designing our predictor, we might want to prioritizing avoiding the second kind of error, even if that leads us to make more of the first kind of error.\nWhat are the types of error? For a binary outcome with a binary predictor, there are four possibilities:\n\n\nTable 4.1: Types of correct classifications and errors in a binary classification problem.\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nTrue Outcome\nPredicted Outcome\n\n\n\n\nTrue positive\nTP\n1\n1\n\n\nFalse negative\nFN\n1\n0\n\n\nFalse positive\nFP\n0\n1\n\n\nTrue negative\nTN\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nGiven a vector of true outcomes \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and a vector of predictions \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\), we can calculate frequencies of each outcome. For example, here are the false positives associated with a given threshold value:\n\nt = 0.5\ny_pred = s &gt;= t \n\n# number where outcome == 0 and prediction == 1\n((y_train == 0)*(y_pred == 1)).sum()\n\n285\n\n\nIn practice, it’s more convenient to compute all the error rates at once using the confusion matrix:\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\nconfusion_matrix(y_train, y_pred)\n\narray([[18136,   285],\n       [ 4264,   887]])\n\n\nThe layout of the confusion matrix is:\ntrue positive,  false positive \nfalse negative, true negative\nIt is common to normalize these counts into rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nFormula\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue positive rate\nTPR\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm{TPR}}{\\mathrm{TPR} + \\mathrm{FNR}}\\)\n\n\n\nFalse negative rate\nFNR\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm{FNR}}{\\mathrm{TPR} + \\mathrm{FNR}}\\)\n\n\n\nFalse positive rate\nFPR\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm{FPR}}{\\mathrm{FPR} + \\mathrm{TNR}}\\)\n\n\n\nTrue negative rate\nTNR\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm{FPR}}{\\mathrm{FPR} + \\mathrm{TNR}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively, the TPR measures the proportion of the time that the classifier predicts the correct (positive) label when the true outcome was positive. Similarly, the FPR measures the proportion of the time that the classifier predicts the incorrect (positive) label when the true outcome was negative. Because \\(\\mathrm{TPR} = 1 - \\mathrm{FNR}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{FPR} = 1 - \\mathrm{TNR}\\), folks usually only bother remembering and using \\(\\mathrm{TPR}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{FNR}\\).\nRather than computing these by hand, Scikit-learn offers a handy argument to confusion_matrix for computing these automatically and simultaneously:\n\nconfusion_matrix(y_train, y_pred, normalize = \"true\")\n\narray([[0.985, 0.015],\n       [0.828, 0.172]])\n\n\nLet’s do a quick check against the FPR using manual vectorized code. Cases where y_pred == 1 correspond to positive predictions, while cases where y_train == 0 correspond to true negative outcomes.\n\n# agrees with the top right corner of the normalized confusion matrix\n((y_pred == 1) & (y_train == 0)).sum() / (y_train == 0).sum()\n\n0.015471472775636501\n\n\n\nThe ROC Curve\nFor any given value of the threshold \\(t\\), we can compute the TPR and FPR. We can think of this process as defining a parametrized function, a curve in TPR-FPR space. This curve is the ROC curve ROC stands for “receiver operating characteristic,” a term that reflects the origin of the curve in detection of objects by radar.\nTo compute an ROC curve, we simply need to compute the TPR and FPR for many different values of the threshold \\(t\\) and plot them.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (6, 4))\n\nnum_thresholds = 101\n\nFPR = np.zeros(num_thresholds)\nTPR = np.zeros(num_thresholds)\nT = np.linspace(s.min()-0.1, s.max()+0.1, num_thresholds)\ns    = linear_score(X_train, w)\n\nfor i in range(num_thresholds):\n    t = T[i]\n    preds    = s &gt;= t\n    FPR[i]   = ((preds == 1) & (y_train == 0)).sum() / (y_train == 0).sum()\n    TPR[i]   = ((preds == 1) & (y_train == 1)).sum() / (y_train == 1).sum()\n\nax.plot(FPR, TPR, color = \"black\")\nax.plot([0,1], [0,1], linestyle=\"--\", color = \"grey\")\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\nax.set(xlabel = \"False Positive Rate\", ylabel = \"True Positive Rate\", title = \"ROC Curve\")\n\n[Text(0.5, 0, 'False Positive Rate'),\n Text(0, 0.5, 'True Positive Rate'),\n Text(0.5, 1.0, 'ROC Curve')]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the ROC curve as a description of all the possible tradeoffs between the TPR and FPR that are achievable for a given score as we vary the threshold \\(t\\). For example, the curve tells us that if we are willing to tolerate a false positive rate of 0.40, then the best true positive rate we can achieve is approximately 0.77.\nROC curves are often used as a measure of the ability of a score function to classify data into two groups. Curves that bend farther towards the upper left corner of the plot are generally viewed as more effective classifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) is sometimes used as a single quantitative measure describing the classification quality.\n\n\nCost of Errors and Optimal Thresholding\nHow do we choose the tradeoff that works best for us? To answer this kind of question, we need to reflect back on the purpose for which we are building a classifier. According to Table 4.1, there are two ways to be correct (true positive, true negative) and two ways to make an error (false positive, false negative). In order to choose an appropriate tradeoff, we need to think about the benefit of being right in relation to the cost of being wrong.\nA logical way for a bank to approach this problem would be from the perspective of profit-maximization. In the lending business, a bank can make money when loans are fully repaid with interest, but lose money (usually much more) when an individual defaults on the loan. To keep the problem simple, suppose that the bank gains $1 every time they make a loan which is successfully paid back, and that the bank loses $2 every time they make a loan which ends in default. The first scenario happens when the bank makes a true positive identification, while the second case happens when the bank makes a false negative classification.  For a given threshold, the expected gain for the bank when making a loan is thenRemember that the “positive” outcome in this data set is default.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{gain}] = 1\\times \\text{TN} - 2\\times \\text{FN}\\;.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet’s plot the expected gain as a function of the threshold:\n\nTNR = 1 - FPR\nFNR = 1 - TPR\n\ncost_of_FN = -2.0\ngain_of_TN = 1.0\n\ncost =  gain_of_TN*TNR  + cost_of_FN*FNR \n\nplt.plot(T, cost)\nplt.gca().set(ylim = (-0.2, 0.2), xlim = (0, 0.5))\nlabs = plt.gca().set(xlabel = r\"Threshold $t$\", ylabel = \"Expected profit per loan\")\n\n\n\n\nFor these costs, we observe that the bank can make a small expected profit (roughly 17 cents per loan) by using the given score function with threshold of roughly \\(t \\approx 0.21\\). Note that this is very different from the value of the thresold \\(t \\approx 0.4\\) which maximized the unweighted accuracy of the predictor."

    "text": "Who Sets The Cost? Who Pays the Cost?\nIn our analysis above, we assumed a simple optimization objective: the bank is going to maximize its net profit. In formulating this objective, we made assumptions about the costs of different outcomes – to the bank. It’s important to note that the costs of errors to the bank may look very different from the costs of those errors to individuals. For example, if the bank’s prediction system recommends that an individual be denied a loan and the bank acts on this recommendation, then the bank pays no cost. On the other hand, the individual may experience major costs, depending on the purpose for which the loan was requested.\nThis data set includes a coarse description of the purpose of each loan:\n\ndf_all.groupby(\"loan_intent\").size()\n\nloan_intent\nDEBTCONSOLIDATION    5212\nEDUCATION            6453\nHOMEIMPROVEMENT      3605\nMEDICAL              6071\nPERSONAL             5521\nVENTURE              5719\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWhat are the costs of being denied access to borrowed funds to pursue education? What about for medical care?\nIt is of fundamental importance to remember that machine learning systems are embedded in social context; that they are generally developed and implemented by people and organizations that occupy positions of power; and that the costs of these systems are often unequally shared by the people they impact. We will discuss these considerations in much greater detail soon."
